if you read this week's Wisconsin SC judgment, you'll see that the committee report got brushed off. but even so, @BruceBoyden & his colleagues created a definitive factual resource & timeline. compare to the confidential cloak & dagger BS at @UBC , which continues to this day
and consider that the underlying (false) accusation in the Galloway case was *rape*, a criminal act. Yet @UBC admin (none of whom have been held accountable) responded by sending a bunch of letterhead to a former student so she could play Nancy Drew on behalf of her anonymous pal
And when @UBC does get around to the investigation that everyone knows is required into its top-to-bottom disgraceful treatment of L'affaire Galloway, a great lead investigator would be @BruceBoyden , who served as Interim Chair of the relevant @MarquetteU committee.

No disrespect but monopolising govt institutes sis sometimes bad. For a while in more than a decade, i watched @UBC because of world cup. My friends gathered at my place to watch too. One of them even joked about it. Passed places it was UBC on all coz of WC.

I know @ubc has posted guidelines and SFU has graduated a few doctoral students this way.
It was such a fabulous week and we are sad to say good-bye to all our #transplantathletes , #organdonors , donor families, and supporters. Hope you leave @UBC and #YVR with amazing memories. #CTGames2018 Video from @olafphoto https:// flic.kr/p/Kgt8fR
