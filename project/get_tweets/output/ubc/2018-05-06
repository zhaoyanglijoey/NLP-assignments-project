#ISPD18 James McCormack @UBC talks on 'Less is More' - away from 'treatment' to 'discussion' thresholds in guidelines - still #dichotomania though pic.twitter.com/SV74j1epQ4
Calling all young scientists! Join us for @UBC 's Science Rendezvous on May 12th: take a ride on a hovercraft, (safely) observe explosive chemical reactions, and tour Canada's largest particle accelerator. List of events: https:// bit.ly/2rjjTXk #sciren #odysci

It is too easy (and commendable) to stand by the academic freedom of @TomDavidoff when he is on the same side of the government that funds @UBC . It is much more important for @UBC to uphold a faculty's right for academic freedom against powerful interests with deep pockets.
The @ubyssey can also do that as they already have a hilarious file on the useful idiot of the @VancouverSun . More importantly, @ubcprez has to issue a statement acknowledging the conclusion of the Smith report, that @UBC failed to protect the academic freedom of @JBerdahl
Another amazing presentation with my partner is crime @caseeyrhaae we out here moving mountains. Shout out to @UBC for having us out. pic.twitter.com/X1hfM9noMI
