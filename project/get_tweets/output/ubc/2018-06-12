This sucks man. My course registration is in an hour and I can't even access SSC. This happens every year and I'm sure it can easily be fixed. @UBC @ubcprez please help!
@UBC After the first handful of people are able to register, SSC spends the rest of the day throwing errors. This has happened every year i've been at UBC, when is this going to get fixed?
So UBC can charge 8x to foreigners yet we cant do the same for housing? Clearly @ubc is racist.

It was an honour to be a part of building this book with Dr. DeGagne, president of @NipissingU , Dr. Grant Charles of @UBC and Dr. Glen Lowry of @OCAD . My hands are raised to you three and all the contributors.
Can you @alejandroadem now help @UBC out and develop a graduate student "pipeline" (did I say pipeline?) between @Conacyt_MX and UBC? If 150 grads are targeted for @UofT , 200 should be coming here. @ubcprez
