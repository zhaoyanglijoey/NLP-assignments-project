@UBC @AMS_UBC I stand with the SASC because I support survivors. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
6/ 3. We call on the @UBC Board of Governors to update Policy 131 in order to add the SASC as a key partner to collaborate with, to meet the needs of survivors, in relation to point 2.2 of said policy.
5/ 2. Tell the UBC Board of Governors and AMS Council you stand with the SASC and support choices for survivors.Tweet them at @AMS_UBC and @UBC using the hashtags #SaveTheSASC and #ChoicesforSurvivors , email, phone, and show up to their meetings to voice your concerns.

This decision was fully made by the @AMS_UBC . I'm sure @UBC pressured them, but the @AMS_UBC made this decision and they can reverse it.

Smarten the heck up. @UBC @AMS_UBC @ubcprez #ChoicesForSurvivors #SaveTheSASC
This is a hard day with news that the @AMS_UBC and @UBC are choosing to shut down the support services provided by the Sexual Assault Support Centre. This office has provided 16 years of support and advocacy and is vital for survivors across the whole UBC community. #SaveTheSASC
. @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors @SaveTheSASC With the continuous diminishing of student support and blatant commercialization of the school, how long until it becomes a business and not a place of education? This is school is UNSAFE.
Instead of making campus a safer and more supportive space for survivors, @AMS_UBC @UBC are taking away a vital source of aid and advocacy. This is an appalling step backward for any institution. @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC
@UBC @AMS_UBC Make no mistake you've just told all survivors on campus that (surprise surprise) they can't trust this institution. That you won't protect them nor have their interests in mind. We don't forget. And we won't forgive this injustice #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
What an absurd move by @ubc and @AMS_UBC If anything UBC has proven that there is a need for more supports and services, #SaveTheSASC
Also, it's not collaboration if the SASC team was not a part of the decision-making process. Your statement is full of BS. @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC
It is not up to you to decide that SVPRO is good enough for all survivors. @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC
@ubc @AMS_UBC #savethesasc #choicesforsurvivors
I am appalled by @AMS_UBC & @UBC decision to defund the SASC. The SASC helped and advocated for me when all other UBC offices left me out in the cold during my harassment case. UBC doesn't care about survivors, only it's reputation. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
#SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors @ubc / @AMS_UBC Being on UBC campus can be alienating enough for ppl struggling to find trauma-informed resources we can trust. Well-intentioned as SVPRO may be, closing a trusted resource like SASC means some might not feel safe accessing SVPRO.
more resources not less @UBC @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC #ChoiceForSurvivors
UBC needs inclusive, grassroots, student-led responses to sexualized violence. A diverse range of approaches is needed to reach marginalized communities whose institutional distrust is not unfounded. @UBC @AMS_UBC #SaveTheSASC
Let's not limit options for survivors and eliminate the @UBC 's only resource for persons who have caused harm and want to do better. #SaveTheSASC @AMS_UBC
@AMS_UBC @UBC UBC has decided to close down the SASC, the sexual assault support centre on campus that has been doing very important work for survivors for 16 years. This is a huge step backwards. Save the fucking SASC #SaveTheSASC
#SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors @ubc / @AMS_UBC More students, staff, & faculty than we know face barriers to participating on campus every day bc of multiple oppressions, incl. trauma & sexual violence. Even recognizing SVPRO as a resource, closing SASC will *not* help.
This makes me ashamed to be an alumnus. Your lack of support for students is astounding @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC I'm not always happy with UBC's choices but closing the SASC is one of the most despicable moves so far. Happy to be graduating, but not proud to have the UBC mark on my degree. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
As an alumni, I'm extremely disappointed. @UBC #ubcaccountable
The decision to shut down SASC by @UBC and @AMS_UBC is cruel. This is a school that actively punishes survivors. I truly hope that the people behind the decision know they are bad people and that they will be remembered as such.
@UBC @AMS_UBC #SavetheSasc #ChoicesforSurvivors if you care AT ALL about students in any meaningful capacity do NOT take this away- at best it's tone deaf, assuming UBC counselling wait times are not atrocious, at best malicious negligence for students
Deeply disappointed by @UBC and @AMS_UBC 's unjust decision to end support services for survivors at the SASC. The SASC is reliable and trustworthy, and my first thought whenever I need support. @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
The decision of @AMS_UBC and @ubc to close the SASC is another confirmation of the university's complete lack of care for student health. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
I have personally benefited from the services offered by this office. So have my students and colleagues. @ubc and @ams_ubc need to be held accountable for this decision. #SaveTheSASC
