There's also the little details like how the new bus loop ridiculously has rain shelters only where the buses sit out of service, and not at most of the actual stops along the road where students wait in the rain for the 41, 43, 480 etc. Such poor planning @UBC ...
Not directly, I will give you that, but the way this plays out in Canada at @UBC for example is that some professors in the Native Studies department, for example, forbid students to deny the existence of aboriginal land title because that's "colonialism and racism."

Well, this depends where you are. UK denied admission to @Lauren_Southern over speech acts, in Canada there is no protection for free speech, Universities are like Marxist Gulags, @UBC has been since 1990 when Senate Minutes show the Senate torted the Engineering Undrgrd Society

The culture in science is changing, and increasingly value is placed not only on results, but also on data collection, and the @UBC neuroscience community will be part of informing that change. http:// ow.ly/orKG30iYqHh
The problem is that at this point, for decades Universities have simply been using ad hoc discipline to exclude students/faculty who won't toe the Marxist line. @UBC senate minutes show signs of Marxist infiltration as of late 80s.

This has been a problem since the late 80s. @UBC censored the EUS in 1990 for publishing something that the socialist administrators found "offensive." The formalization of the censorship was required due to the Internet, people could communicate about what was going down.
