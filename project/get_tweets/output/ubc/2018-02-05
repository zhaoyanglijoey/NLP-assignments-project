Sitting in #Kelowna Airport waiting for a flight and the young woman next to me suddenly makes an odd gasping sound. When I look up to check on her, she turns to me, eyes wide, and squeaks: "I just got accepted to @UBC !!!" I feel like a proud mom! #kids #gladIwasthereforher

I'm fortunate to call this place home, and acknowledge the First Nations that still do. Thanks for having me in this territory @UBCGradSchool @UBC pic.twitter.com/rDGYhf1m1a
