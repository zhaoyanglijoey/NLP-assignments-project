But you're not the one asking - they are! I don't think you should solicit people to work for no pay, but if you find yourself approached by a student wanting to gain work experience and you don't have the funds to pay them, then I see nothing wrong with it. This is common @UBC .

This decision was fully made by the @AMS_UBC . I'm sure @UBC pressured them, but the @AMS_UBC made this decision and they can reverse it.

Smarten the heck up. @UBC @AMS_UBC @ubcprez #ChoicesForSurvivors #SaveTheSASC
This is a hard day with news that the @AMS_UBC and @UBC are choosing to shut down the support services provided by the Sexual Assault Support Centre. This office has provided 16 years of support and advocacy and is vital for survivors across the whole UBC community. #SaveTheSASC
. @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors @SaveTheSASC With the continuous diminishing of student support and blatant commercialization of the school, how long until it becomes a business and not a place of education? This is school is UNSAFE.
Instead of making campus a safer and more supportive space for survivors, @AMS_UBC @UBC are taking away a vital source of aid and advocacy. This is an appalling step backward for any institution. @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC
@UBC @AMS_UBC Make no mistake you've just told all survivors on campus that (surprise surprise) they can't trust this institution. That you won't protect them nor have their interests in mind. We don't forget. And we won't forgive this injustice #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
What an absurd move by @ubc and @AMS_UBC If anything UBC has proven that there is a need for more supports and services, #SaveTheSASC
Also, it's not collaboration if the SASC team was not a part of the decision-making process. Your statement is full of BS. @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC
It is not up to you to decide that SVPRO is good enough for all survivors. @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC
@ubc @AMS_UBC #savethesasc #choicesforsurvivors
I am appalled by @AMS_UBC & @UBC decision to defund the SASC. The SASC helped and advocated for me when all other UBC offices left me out in the cold during my harassment case. UBC doesn't care about survivors, only it's reputation. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
#SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors @ubc / @AMS_UBC Being on UBC campus can be alienating enough for ppl struggling to find trauma-informed resources we can trust. Well-intentioned as SVPRO may be, closing a trusted resource like SASC means some might not feel safe accessing SVPRO.
more resources not less @UBC @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC #ChoiceForSurvivors
UBC needs inclusive, grassroots, student-led responses to sexualized violence. A diverse range of approaches is needed to reach marginalized communities whose institutional distrust is not unfounded. @UBC @AMS_UBC #SaveTheSASC
Let's not limit options for survivors and eliminate the @UBC 's only resource for persons who have caused harm and want to do better. #SaveTheSASC @AMS_UBC
@AMS_UBC @UBC UBC has decided to close down the SASC, the sexual assault support centre on campus that has been doing very important work for survivors for 16 years. This is a huge step backwards. Save the fucking SASC #SaveTheSASC
#SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors @ubc / @AMS_UBC More students, staff, & faculty than we know face barriers to participating on campus every day bc of multiple oppressions, incl. trauma & sexual violence. Even recognizing SVPRO as a resource, closing SASC will *not* help.
This makes me ashamed to be an alumnus. Your lack of support for students is astounding @AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC I'm not always happy with UBC's choices but closing the SASC is one of the most despicable moves so far. Happy to be graduating, but not proud to have the UBC mark on my degree. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
As an alumni, I'm extremely disappointed. @UBC #ubcaccountable
The decision to shut down SASC by @UBC and @AMS_UBC is cruel. This is a school that actively punishes survivors. I truly hope that the people behind the decision know they are bad people and that they will be remembered as such.
@UBC @AMS_UBC #SavetheSasc #ChoicesforSurvivors if you care AT ALL about students in any meaningful capacity do NOT take this away- at best it's tone deaf, assuming UBC counselling wait times are not atrocious, at best malicious negligence for students
Deeply disappointed by @UBC and @AMS_UBC 's unjust decision to end support services for survivors at the SASC. The SASC is reliable and trustworthy, and my first thought whenever I need support. @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
The decision of @AMS_UBC and @ubc to close the SASC is another confirmation of the university's complete lack of care for student health. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
I have personally benefited from the services offered by this office. So have my students and colleagues. @ubc and @ams_ubc need to be held accountable for this decision. #SaveTheSASC
Unacceptable decision by AMS and @UBC . Been on several panels w/SASC and their ethic on violence is expansive, inclusive, survivor centered. Given rampant rape culture condoned by UBC, having space that is not proximal to institutional authority is vital! #SaveTheSASC #vanpoli

If @UBC bows to this activist muzzling freedom of speech then they in fact breaching s. 2(b) of the Charter. Preventing others from speaking is not freedom of speech. pic.twitter.com/Ein9TXjADu
How can we successfully retain #WomenInEngineering ? Engendering Engineering Success, a project by @UBC , @UAIberta , and @uofg back in 2014 released two studies that address this topic, and we summarized it for you here: http:// i.sfu.ca/bfozEZ #RaisingTheBar #INWED18 pic.twitter.com/87O718fG8v
After the year you've had, closing existing supports really seems like a good idea, @ubc ? This alumnus is not proud #SaveTheSASC
@AMS_UBC @UBC I stand with the SASC and I support choices for survivors. The SASC offers important and necessary services for survivors at UBC. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC plz
This is not only horrific, but so backwards and egregious a decision; so irresponsible and deeply misogynist a move, @UBC . Explain yourselves. This decision is a boon to #rapeculture and #victimblaming . I am sickened at this news. #Ibelievesurvivors #metoo #UBC #SaveTheSASC
Shame! @UBC and @AMS_UBC for the unilateral decision to close the SASC without centering the needs of survivors. @ubcprez are u aware of this decision? UBC Board of Governors, update Policy 131, 2.2 to add the SASC as a key partner/collaborator. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
It has been really wonderful to host Dr. Fredrik Bengtsson from @lunduniversity here @UBCmedicine this week. Lots of wonderful potential for #meded and #tech collaborations. @u21news @ubc @ubc_eml pic.twitter.com/FEVt9MnCRX
Appalled and outraged that SASC services are being discontinued. There are too many stories of institutions cutting corners trying to save face. Independent services provide accountability and are a more approachable option for survivors. #SavetheSASC @AMS_UBC @UBC
reading @ubc 's policy on sexual assault and this point sticks out for the wrong reasons: once SASC's support services are cut by @AMS_UBC , vancouver r*pe relief, an org with a history of violence against trans folks, will be a 1st point of contact in SVPRO referrals #SaveTheSASC pic.twitter.com/4zxOWzkLcb
Can @AMS_UBC guarantee to me that the new service is going to be as welcoming to the moniroties as SASC is? I am a queer and gender variant individual. I trust SASC to have our backs which I can't always say about @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
When I was an organizer for @PrideUBC I proposed that UBC begin running workshops for all students about sexual assault & gender/sexuality inclusion on campus. The SASC provided many resources and helped support this project. @UBC of course said NO to the workshops #SaveTheSASC

things like sexual health & wellbeing & healthy relationships, which frankly I don't see from any other ams or ubc group/program. I'm disappointed and angry that @AMS_UBC and @UBC have decided to elimate it without any input from the SASC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors (2/2)
@AMS_UBC @UBC I've volunteered at the SASC for the past 2 years and have always felt comforted by the supportive environment the other volunteers and support workers have provided. The SASC does crucial work around campus such as educating others on (1/2)

#SaveTheSASC Tell us why you want to stop supporting the SASC. @UBC @AMS_UBC
@AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC
@AMS_UBC @UBC Please, do not shut down the SASC as it would be DEVASTATING and incredibly harmful for survivors. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors

Galloway has settled with @UBC he can still litigate against individuals

How fast do I need to build on fortnite to be accepted into your architecture program? @UBC
@AMS_UBC shutting down the Sexual Assault Support Centre. @UBC needs this space, it's essential, folks need support and a space that centres survivors. SASC needs to be included in the decisions. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
A strong & competitive education system is key to Canada's success in the future economy! Read interviews with Presidents of @mcgillu , @UWaterloo , @UCalgary , @UBC & other top leaders! #Talent #Education #STEM #Entrepreneurship #Youth #Leaders #Innovation #FutureEconomyCanada
The defunding of the Sexual Assault Support Centre at UBC is unacceptable. This impacts thousands of students (mainly minorities) and is a life-saving resource. The @AMS_UBC and @UBC need to reconsider this dangerous choice. @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC
I saw Peterson, Harris and Weinstein at the Orpheum last night. I can assure @UBC that I was unharmed by the event. No one seemed to suffer deep hurt or harm. The conversation was a meaningful and respectful exchange of ideas along with a few good laughs.
Even in my year as an exchange student at @UBC I witnessed how important the SASC is to students there. #SavetheSASC (1/2)
@AMS_UBC @UBC getting rid of the SASC is extremely negligent. By cutting the amount and time of available resources by more than half, you are ensuring that more of these crimes go unreported and more survivors are left helpless and hopeless. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
This is really disappointing, @ubc https://www. cbc.ca/amp/1.4719788 #vancouver #feedly
@AMS_UBC @UBC althought i've never used SASC's services, i know it's extremely important for many students, and it's disappointing to see support for it terminated without even consulting WITH them before making the decision #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC SASC is an absolute NECESSITY for those who do not know how else to reach out #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors because the decision to get rid of the SASC is trash and unfair to people who rely on the SASC. I shouldn't have to say anything else.
It is not Work-Life Balance but "Work-Life Blend" as my @UBCEducAlum sister @RosyLoodu and I discuss @UBCmedicine and @UBCEduc topics on a sunny Saturday afternoon in Vancouver. Grateful to @UBC for this connection! @ubcprez @deltasd37 @bctf @DoctorsOfBC pic.twitter.com/aeNagyj2uo
Research at @UBC shows that the albumin-binding [177Lu]HTK01169 significantly reduced tumor growth relative to control in prostate cancer mouse xenograft model. #SNMMI18
Extremely disappointed in the decisions of @UBC and @AMS_UBC , especially given the dubious nature of how they were made. SASC is a campus staple and survivors of sexual assault deserve multiple accessible choices in avenues of healing. #SavetheSASC
