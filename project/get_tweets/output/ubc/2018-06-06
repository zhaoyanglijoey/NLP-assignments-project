I fondly remember listening to his 8:00 am newscast on @cknw (of course followed my Neil Macrae) in my car in the parking lot at @UBC before my 8:30 am lectures. I may have been late a few times. Fantastic!
Last night waited 1 1/2 hours for bus out of @UBC campus. First @TransLink bus "out of service", 2nd bus "out of service", 3rd bus bypassed my stop and circled around another route. No other busses came despite all night service. Was charged $6 for four pieces of fruit. #PTSD
@UBC is banning #singleuse plastic cutlery and straws! Proud of the exciting progress being made on home soil.
