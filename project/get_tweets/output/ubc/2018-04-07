Looking forward to meeting New York City's @UBC applicants tomorrow morning, and sharing stories of my time as an undergraduate student in Vancouver with: @UBCartscoop , @UBCIR , @UBCSLC , @UBCrez and more! #IAMUBC
Great Google Hangout chat with a @UBC student that @ubcprez Ono referred to me to talk about careers in student affairs! Excellent student! Thank you for connecting us. #Mentorship
Dear @UBC : Perhaps it might be an idea to fix our classrooms, decrease class sizes, reduce student fees, & hire more front-line research & teaching faculty (vs. administrative inc. para-academic bloat)? Rather than spending money on marketing, inc. promoted ads on social media? pic.twitter.com/AU5FsNliQe
Truly loved my last stop as a #PSF Visiting Professor at @UBC #Vancouver . #PlasticSurgery @ASPS_News pic.twitter.com/rc9cGLzQxW
Some #weekendreading Fabio Rossi ( @UBC ) and Coral Lewis ( @STEMCELLTech ) review recent literature on how #microglial cells, which are fully differentiated, are able to self-renew. Read the @NatureNeuro article here. http:// ow.ly/TsLX30jmJLg
If @UBC doesn't play @Drake 's "Nice for What" when I cross the stage for my M.Ed next month... I will whip out my own speakers.
