Strange day today with 2 solicitations in my inbox, very probably inspired by my 3rd term on @UBC BoG: one to run for "MP for Point Grey," which I am not considering. Another to go for the presidency of the Royal Society of Canada, which I am.
odd that it came out of @UBC but does not include #Canada ? Great study regardless.
Absolutely agree! If @UBC and @TransLink could work on a solution where the drill doesn't get removed at Arbutus, the construction site at Arbutus would be minimal and @UBC phase could be completed sooner.
Hey @UBC glad to know you allow and promote hate speech to be said on your campus by letting Ben Shapiro speak there on October 31st. You may want to delete the ethics section of your mission statement.
Doing a super job being on vacation.. walking around @UBC thinking about universities.

Patients with mild #COPD have little to no symptoms, but they've already lost on average 40% of their small airways. This finding highlights the need for drugs for earlier treatment while COPD might still be reversible: http:// ow.ly/ulDU30kTCVg via @ubcnews @UBC @InnovationCA pic.twitter.com/Wm1uiU7Kee
Are you struggling to find work for the upcoming school year? If so, you might want to consider attending the Work On Campus Fair on August 8th, where @UBC will connect you with on-campus employers! Bring you resume! #studentlife (Photo: Hoover Collective) pic.twitter.com/H6kQNrI8A8
Precisely. Ironic that @Sparklebroom , the gleeful cheerleader of Galloway's Star Chamber @UBC board, has "Be Kind" as her bio tag. I've noticed this with many rabidly intolerant #SJWs and far-leftists. They weaponize "empathy" in order to take on an aura of moral superiority.
There is nothing better than sitting in the Rose Garden @UBC ! Sunshine, and a gentle breeze to waft the gentle rose fragrance - #bonus ! #gradlife #SpacesMatter pic.twitter.com/ruxXWYXEoY

#Vancouver - Police have University Boulevard closed between Westbrook Mall and Blanca Road @UBC until further notice. Use West 4th/Chancellor or West 16th instead. ^TD #UBC
In addition to its beauty, the Reconciliation Pole outside my building always gives me pause. Anyone at @UBC should see it, and read its story. It's powerful. Sobering. We can't forget our history as we try to move into the future. @ubcforestry pic.twitter.com/uw0zEG0tb0
So today I turned in my keys @ubcforestry . All I can say is thank you. Enjoyed taking one more walk to the rose garden. Where I'd go whenever I was stressed and needed a minute. @UBC is beautiful. The Forestry building is beautiful, from inside to out. pic.twitter.com/jhhWVlPIsc

Was at the University of British Columbia's ( @UBC ) studios and emerging media lab today. They really do have some great toys especially in #VR #AR and video production. This was a first step at exploring how @COL4D can use this tech for the developing world. pic.twitter.com/ORXP0Q6XpN
