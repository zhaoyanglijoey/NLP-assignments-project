. @ubc should send out automated email reminders about student card expiry. Normally I wouldn't think this is a big deal but if your student card expires, you can't use the bus pass you've paid for (1/2).

Happy Imagine Day @UBC
A thread 1/3 @UBC #PIs : If you have #GradStudent (s) on a #stipend or #award , pls check in w/ them. Many of us have not been paid this term & will have late fees bec we can't pay them. Not all students will be comfy enough to volunteer this info to you, esp if they're new.
1 project could include multiple phases or just a single phase. @UBC extension could also divert all existing 99 B Line resources to other routes requiring additional buses.
Great but not enough. Extension should go all the way to @UBC in 1 project. Stopping TBM near Arbutus could cause more problems than necessary. If the TBM stops along the wide median of University Blvd west of Blanca St, then there would be less problems with TBM removal.
Thanks everyone for packing out @UBC 's Walter Gage Ballroom for our @AMS_UBC_Events Improv Special! So much fun swimming with the Loch Ness Monster, exploring Charlie's Chocolate Factory, and swapping bodies with mom for a day! Have a wonderful school year, everyone! @AMS_UBC pic.twitter.com/nw1mzUxCGX
