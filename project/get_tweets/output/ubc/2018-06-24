Galloway has settled with @UBC he can still litigate against individuals

How fast do I need to build on fortnite to be accepted into your architecture program? @UBC
@AMS_UBC shutting down the Sexual Assault Support Centre. @UBC needs this space, it's essential, folks need support and a space that centres survivors. SASC needs to be included in the decisions. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
A strong & competitive education system is key to Canada's success in the future economy! Read interviews with Presidents of @mcgillu , @UWaterloo , @UCalgary , @UBC & other top leaders! #Talent #Education #STEM #Entrepreneurship #Youth #Leaders #Innovation #FutureEconomyCanada
The defunding of the Sexual Assault Support Centre at UBC is unacceptable. This impacts thousands of students (mainly minorities) and is a life-saving resource. The @AMS_UBC and @UBC need to reconsider this dangerous choice. @SaveTheSASC #SaveTheSASC
I saw Peterson, Harris and Weinstein at the Orpheum last night. I can assure @UBC that I was unharmed by the event. No one seemed to suffer deep hurt or harm. The conversation was a meaningful and respectful exchange of ideas along with a few good laughs.
Even in my year as an exchange student at @UBC I witnessed how important the SASC is to students there. #SavetheSASC (1/2)
@AMS_UBC @UBC getting rid of the SASC is extremely negligent. By cutting the amount and time of available resources by more than half, you are ensuring that more of these crimes go unreported and more survivors are left helpless and hopeless. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
This is really disappointing, @ubc https://www. cbc.ca/amp/1.4719788 #vancouver #feedly
@AMS_UBC @UBC althought i've never used SASC's services, i know it's extremely important for many students, and it's disappointing to see support for it terminated without even consulting WITH them before making the decision #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC SASC is an absolute NECESSITY for those who do not know how else to reach out #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors because the decision to get rid of the SASC is trash and unfair to people who rely on the SASC. I shouldn't have to say anything else.
It is not Work-Life Balance but "Work-Life Blend" as my @UBCEducAlum sister @RosyLoodu and I discuss @UBCmedicine and @UBCEduc topics on a sunny Saturday afternoon in Vancouver. Grateful to @UBC for this connection! @ubcprez @deltasd37 @bctf @DoctorsOfBC pic.twitter.com/aeNagyj2uo
Research at @UBC shows that the albumin-binding [177Lu]HTK01169 significantly reduced tumor growth relative to control in prostate cancer mouse xenograft model. #SNMMI18
Extremely disappointed in the decisions of @UBC and @AMS_UBC , especially given the dubious nature of how they were made. SASC is a campus staple and survivors of sexual assault deserve multiple accessible choices in avenues of healing. #SavetheSASC
