@UBC Hi, UBC. I want to know what is the final data of accept online course credit for an ungraduate student who will apply you this year? I hear my school counsellor said it will end by March 31. Is it true?
Absolutely right. I went to law school @UBC when tuition was capped at $3500 a year. I worked 40 hours a week and would have never made it through if prices were higher. Wonder how many people like me can't go any more.
