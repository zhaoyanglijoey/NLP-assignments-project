That UBC is nowhere to be seen in Ottawa is somewhat understandable, but why none of the government consultations (CCRI, skills, etc...) happening now in Western Canada is @UBC . We have never been so invisible!
Last year, @UBC physical plant distributed earplugs to everyone (wanting) in my building. OK, I called when the noise from a neighboring construction/refurbishing site became unbearable.
Just back from the liquor store, where I met at least two senior @UBC administrators. One ignored me. The other commented:"It doesn't look good (all of us being there), doesn't it?
I'm excited to announce that starting Jan 2019 I will be off to Vancouver to start a Ph.D. @UBC 's Genome Science and Technology Program where I will join Dr. Marco Marra's group at Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre! @bccancerfdn #phdlife #WomenInSTEM
