So glad I decided to stay @UBC , what an amazing campus!
Mark @ProvostParlange will take good care of you. He did so even for the non-engineers from @ubc , so you should expect the red carpet (on the rugby field?)
#QRSE2018 has been my favourite conference to date. Learned lots, met some wonderful people and explored the beautiful @UBC campus & city of #Vancouver . Well done on a great few days @QRSE2018 . Looking forward to the next one already.
This looks intriguing... @UBC @UBCAsianStudies @UBCACAM https:// cantonese.arts.ubc.ca/cw2/
Big crew of @ubcengineering on this flight... try to survive without us @ubc ... Looking forward to seeing our friends @MonashUni soon...
Writing incomplete story of abuse of power without victim account, mired in ssssshhhh-policy of @ubc . One-sided golden-boy-wronged journalism do not vindicate man who was found to have abused his power. #stackedmistakes #wreckage #metoo #ubcaccountable
@LJMU maybe we could look into policy and implement this somewhere along the Mersey @UBC @QRSE2018 pic.twitter.com/CubUC85rd1

@UBC seems to have many pathetic fakes relying on a name to define them. Better than non grads but still that should be one subject covered in the school :p #HigherEducation #BrandSuckers
Have a great weekend @ubc folks, academics and humans everywhere! Be sure to take the time you need to find your balance and breathe--whatever that looks like for you! #academiclife #phdchat pic.twitter.com/7B0XpzaGib
