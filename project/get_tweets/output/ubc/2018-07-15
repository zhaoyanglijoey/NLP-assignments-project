Ha - nice try @ubcprez @PhilipUBC - of course these secret reasons wont be secret for much longer when that 3rd party arbitrator (aka the courts) subpoenas @UBC when addressing the outstanding matters. The identity of the serial complainant 'MC' will also no longer secret.
Just dropped off my son James for @UBC Future Global Leaders program ... he's staying in the same residence I did when I was a student - fun day, a little sad when I left ... he's growing up too fast! As an alumni & Faculty for @ubcspph MHA program feels great to have him attend pic.twitter.com/IpxDSDAKqq
Almost certainly he did - @UBC would have insisted on indemnity - it's 'hush' money and used by corrupt individuals to avoid accountability #ubcaccountable . My opinion of Galloway isn't diminished as obviously he would want to limit the trauma he and his family have experienced.
In my experience reputation management policies are standard policy for any organisation, particularly universities, regardless of which media? Progressive discipline is only optional and not usually bound by law - Steven Galloway's summary dismissal from @UBC is a good example.
Great Sunday brunch with @CherylHolmesMD , @UBCmedicine Associate Dean of the @UBCMDUP celebrating her birthday and wedding anniversary...reminded me of @UBC 's provincial reach. #celebrations @ubcprez pic.twitter.com/Ea89k9CRvu
Damaging the reputation of the university is one of the main criteria for dismissal of academic staff at most (all?) Universities. As @UBC and Steven Galloway shows rumour and false accusations are very costly criteria for dismissal of academic staff.

Please do not remove TBM at Arbutus but keep it running past Arbutus. If necessary, please work with @UBC ASAP on implementing extension beyond Arbutus.
Pay more attention to, and write about, @UBC BoG. It should be exciting now that the faculty want in.
That's a good point. It's just frustrating to see steadfast respect for her privacy but complete disregard for Steven's. Not just from @UBC but the media outlets as well.
Wow. And @SFU stands behind her statements. Does the institution not realize that its reputation is its only currency? Devaluing it does its hardworking students (and alumni) a real disservice. So glad I went to @UBC !

These living solar cells make energy, even in bad weather. Might even be practical in #Seattle ? https:// buff.ly/2JeTCPW #biotech by @UBC via @DigitalTrends
Taxpayers will back a #CarbonTax if they get a cheque in the mail, say Werner Antweiler & @sgulati of @UBC ( @ConversationCA in @nationalpost ) http:// bit.ly/2uolQTY
Extraordinary that any university @SFU @UBC could (let alone would) employ a person like @hkpmcgregor to teach. While you cannot blame a stupid person for being stupid - it is those who enable and facilitate people and behavior like this who need to be held to account. @SFUmedia
A group of @UBC students have designed a special cart with shelves and locks to store the possessions of people living on the streets. The carts will be rolled out with help from a local church: http:// ctv.news/c6G6oqi pic.twitter.com/dPVn0fl7VF
So, @PiersatPenn was, I think, the first renowned academic I saw speak in person (when I was applying to my MA at @UBC ). It was like seeing a celebrity. Now I get to take photos with her at conferences :) #ncs18 #MedievalTwitter #langlandiansunite pic.twitter.com/5Iv4jXNTwA
If @PhilipUBC and @ubcprez believe that everyone at @UBC acted so professionally then I suppose they too must support the idea of an independent inquiry. If they didn't screw this up then taxpayers deserve to know who did. #ubcaccountable
So excited for my next adventure! Robson Square is where I will take my French course through UBC. Thank you again to the Ministry of Education for making this happen! Will see you tomorrow Vancouver! @CTVVancouver @RobsonSqConcert @UBC @RCSD_No81 pic.twitter.com/HinonFlMud
