We should be taking money out of low value health care, and place it into upstream interventions that address the #SDoH . Great point! @UBC @BeneDataTrust #healthspending
Per Craig Mitton @UBC 's point - U.S. states are already tying spending growth to state GDP (MA, MD, VT) - not a bridge too far #HealthSpending
. @UBC 's Craig Mitton says it's "staggering" to think U.S. can't accept trade-offs in tackling #healthspending . Probably right, but need to do so w/o stifling #innovation .
. @UBC Craig Mitton: Must accept that tradeoffs have to be made to address costs. Look at investment & disinvestment within ethically based process that includes all stakeholder voices. #healthspending #GoingBelowtheSurface
Craig Mitton from @UBC lets the Americans know #healthspending is so much more important than hockey. @Health_Affairs
@UBC Craig Mitton: 2 of 2: Value Cautions: Political tensions will exist. Patient and public input can help. Will need a coordinated approach and along with strong leadership and champions. #healthspending #GoingBelowTheSurface
Craig Mitton, Prof School of Population & Public Health @UBC talks about allocating resources in the #healthcare system. Notes that many countries are leaning towards broader definition of value - cost effectiveness is not the only input. #healthspending #GoingBelowTheSurface
@UBC Craig Mitton: Value: measuring it is important, need multiple criteria to define it, and to determine what we do (more of and less of). #healthspending #GoingBelowTheSurface
