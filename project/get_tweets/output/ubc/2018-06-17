I'M COMING TO @UBC ! I've reached an agreement with UBC to deliver a guest lecture in September regarding Asian representation in media and in culture. I'll be doing a lecture and public Q&A. And also probably biking along the seawall, hiking, and doing other Vancouvery things ;P
Here @UBC we have the privilege of living and studying right on the beach, but with that privilege comes responsibility. If you're interested in maintaining a healthy coastline, make sure to RSVP to the Coastal Community Action Panel @LiuInstituteUBC tomorrow from 6 to 8PM! pic.twitter.com/ARCLwddNM4
