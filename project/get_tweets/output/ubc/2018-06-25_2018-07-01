@AMS_UBC @UBC I would never recommend UBC to a prospective student without the support the SASC provides, and I will be sure to explicitly tell my next class of students to avoid it entirely. I implore you to reconsider this decision.
@AMS_UBC @UBC Your choice to close the SASC is horrendous. Why would you rob vulnerable students of the support they need? This will do nothing but harm your students and deeply impact your reputation. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
show your students that you care more about their safety and not your reputation #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors @UBC @AMS_UBC
