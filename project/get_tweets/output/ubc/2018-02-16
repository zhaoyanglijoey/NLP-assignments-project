The G319S CRISPR cell model @TaylorMorriseau discussed was generated in collaboration with @nictitate at @UBC #CNPRM2018
My academic-related abbreviations are getting too overloaded! Distinct based on regions that collaborators are in In UK, BC can mean British Chapter ( @bcismrm ); in USA, it would be @BostonCollege (where I did my postdoc); in Canada, people would think British Columbia ( @UBC )
In case you missed it: Findings from a study out of @UBC show many Canadians are facing the frightening situation of having to pick between paying for food or their prescriptions. #ICYMI #pharmacare #FoodSecurity | http:// bit.ly/2EpOsiL

Great to see this qualitative research approach. We've always said qualitative research would help set the foundation for mixed methods or quant. cannabis studies. Thanks @UBC !
I lived in Gage Towers while attending @UBC in the '80s and now know a bit about 'Mr. UBC', a university prof and 'reluctant' president who meant so much to so many. http://www. cbc.ca/1.4536317

I teach a 4th year Human Molecular Genetics course and always have students very interested in the field, and yet their options are so limited. Any idea why @UBC takes so few??

Great @UBC event at the Museum of Vancouver tonight! It is up to all scientists to "cultivate curiosity" in the public (especially the youth!) and to engage in more effective communication of science as a process. Thanks to @JenniferGardy and the panel for a wonderful discussion! pic.twitter.com/wGgmHzbrbo
@UBC undergrads also have Wine Appreciation courses available to them... who says school has to be boring?
