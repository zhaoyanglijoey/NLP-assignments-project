3) @UBC @PrezOno don't schedule so many classes requiring students to transit at AM rush hour. Later starts! Stagger student body. Schools in the EU do it. 4) @TransLink stagger B-line pickups! Have empty busses start at Cambie in the mornings. How is this not a thing?! #vanpoli
While we wait on the UBC subway to be delayed & go over budget, some ideas: 1) @TransLink run express busses between Commercial & Cambie. Anyone with eyes can see this is a big need. 2) @TransLink join forces with @UBC to run Student & Staff only busses
