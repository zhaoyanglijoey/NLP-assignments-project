3) @UBC Related but this one is about CourseEval: Please stop sending course evaluation notifications to faculty on weekends at midnight. Really. That can also wait until the next business day.
2) @CanvasLMS @UBC Why is it not possible to schedule my notifications to receive them only during business hours? If I schedule them for "once a day", I get them at 7 pm. If "once a week", it's Saturday morning.
A couple of questions about @CanvasLMS at @UBC . 1) Why doesn't Canvas accommodate academic titles? I'd like my name to appear as "Professor Laba" or "Dr. Laba", not just "Izabella Laba, instructor".
