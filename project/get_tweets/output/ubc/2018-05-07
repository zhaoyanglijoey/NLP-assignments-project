Last week, I welcomed @ubcprez Santa Ono to Ottawa. We had great discussions about the new @CanadianForces #DefenceIDEaS program, as well as the incredible innovation happening both at @UBC and throughout the city of #Vancouver pic.twitter.com/RQoIwcnUC1
We produce some of the the best in the world, & our unis (yay,, @ubc !) can be commended for that. Yet too many tech workers still leave Canada for opportunities outside the country. What are the missing links? Lack of funding beyond startups? Wages?Affordability? #techjobs

Hundreds of letters from interned Japanese teens during the #SecondWorldWar have been donated to @UBC . What a fantastic resource! It would be wonderful to see some of these letters digitized for use in classrooms across the country. http:// bit.ly/2jiAUN0 pic.twitter.com/pk3AcjX2C3

With the recent news from @UBC willing to pay for the extension and speeding up @UBC extension, I really hope this would keep the TBM going beyond Arbutus all the way to @UBC . Stopping the TBM at Arbutus is asking for unwanted disruptions to traffic along Broadway and Arbutus.
