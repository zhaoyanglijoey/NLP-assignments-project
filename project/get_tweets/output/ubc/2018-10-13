Just like home: for a moment, we thought we were back on our street in L.A. when we got this notice of filming @cw_charmed around the corner from our house this next few days. Enjoyed their filming @ubc last week, but do they know Monday is our @CityofVancouver trash pickup day? pic.twitter.com/88nPwNer8S
