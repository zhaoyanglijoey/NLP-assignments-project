One thing I keep reflecting on about the @UBC Galloway story: If your friends are gonna conspire to get you fired, publicly shame you, tell the cops to lock you in a psych ward, and falsely accuse you of rape, then they probably weren't really your friends in the first place.
We need a full inquiry. @ubcprez @PhilipUBC and everyone else involved @UBC must be held accountable for what they have done to this innocent man.

Almost certainly he did - @UBC would have insisted on indemnity - it's 'hush' money and used by corrupt individuals to avoid accountability #ubcaccountable . My opinion of Galloway isn't diminished as obviously he would want to limit the trauma he and his family have experienced.
In my experience reputation management policies are standard policy for any organisation, particularly universities, regardless of which media? Progressive discipline is only optional and not usually bound by law - Steven Galloway's summary dismissal from @UBC is a good example.

Damaging the reputation of the university is one of the main criteria for dismissal of academic staff at most (all?) Universities. As @UBC and Steven Galloway shows rumour and false accusations are very costly criteria for dismissal of academic staff.

That's a good point. It's just frustrating to see steadfast respect for her privacy but complete disregard for Steven's. Not just from @UBC but the media outlets as well.
Wow. And @SFU stands behind her statements. Does the institution not realize that its reputation is its only currency? Devaluing it does its hardworking students (and alumni) a real disservice. So glad I went to @UBC !
