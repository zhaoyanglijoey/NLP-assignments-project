@SaraEllenHarris Hi, Sara - I saw your posting to the CLEAN network list. I'm not sure I'll be able to make @theAGU meeting this year, but the proposed work at AGU and @UBC is exciting, and I'd love to try to play a part if feasible. Just wanted to share my appreciation for this.
On July 31, Charlotte Choi, our summer co-op student, will be taking over @UBC 's Snapchat account, where she'll post highlights from her day working with our Seniors Community Support Services. Follow along @youbcsnaps! #RichmondBC pic.twitter.com/s17HskBLzr

3) @UBC Related but this one is about CourseEval: Please stop sending course evaluation notifications to faculty on weekends at midnight. Really. That can also wait until the next business day.
2) @CanvasLMS @UBC Why is it not possible to schedule my notifications to receive them only during business hours? If I schedule them for "once a day", I get them at 7 pm. If "once a week", it's Saturday morning.
A couple of questions about @CanvasLMS at @UBC . 1) Why doesn't Canvas accommodate academic titles? I'd like my name to appear as "Professor Laba" or "Dr. Laba", not just "Izabella Laba, instructor".

@ChanCentre @UBC are allowing fascists like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro talk. Disrupt these events. If you are ubc student your money is allowing this fascist to talk. Show up and make them feel unwelcome in the unceded lands.
Just read @UBC freedom of expression statement. "Everyone at UBC bears the responsibility to recognize the unique vulnerabilities of minority group members and those who have experienced systemic violence." Vulnerabilities? Violence? https:// academic.ubc.ca/freedom-matters @jordanbpeterson help!
I am not sure this is quite true. In the case of #brockcommons @ubc the 18 story #CLT bldg has #concrete stairwells and elevator shafts that support the weight of the CLT. Also because #wood burns no wood is allowed to be exposed. Just the facts please!
