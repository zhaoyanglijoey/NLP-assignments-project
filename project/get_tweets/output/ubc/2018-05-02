Eric Eich, Vice Provost & Associate Vice President Academic, @UBC , on moving forward with open initiatives: Make clear it's not punitive - incentivize people to participate, not punish. Encourage people to raise the standards. #CLW2018
How does your faculty office invite learning? @RobertTalbert : one of the most inviting (i.e., conducive to learning and most 'human') faculty member office spaces I've seen belongs to @Ng_Dave here @UBC Vancouver. #CLW2018
Great morning session at the Open Scholarship in Practice workshop at @UBC today! Lots of research and teaching initiatives and discussions to make Science more open at UBC #OpenUBC
Here's a super fun illustration I developed for @UBC for the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. Swipe to see all 4 panels and the full illustration. pic.twitter.com/s0dVUdSx6u
This is a really interesting 'marriage' of ideas. Thank you for speaking about this @ubc #CLW2018
I wish @UBC understood the implications of allowing limited advances. Apparently something is in the works but not clear how it will work for grad students.
Seniors stick with fitness routines when they work out together http:// ow.ly/M7At30jJviH via @ubcnews @UBC
Before @IndianHorseFilm played at @UBCLonghouse , officials said counselling and trauma resources were available for #ResidentialSchools survivors in the audience who had difficulty watching. This example by @UBC should be best practice when movie shows in Indian country. @ubcprez
I walked & cycled around @UBC , living on campus, for both my @UBCappscience & @UBCMBA degrees, and, upon moving to #Toronto walked to work at Yonge & Eglinton to my first job at General Foods! @BobBrentTO
Single in #kw ? Yes? You might be at a statistical disadvantage, dating-wise. The pool is shallow for one, specific group. Who's that? We'll find out at 710 on @CBCKW891 when I'm joined by @UBC prof @MarinaAdshade .
Rental prices just keep going up and if we have to move far out of the city to live, I'll be far from @UBC and my work will suffer (ADHD makes it impossible to work from home). Things are really starting to sink in about how messed up Vancouver housing is.
1/ Help! I am debating whether I should run again to represent the faculty on the @UBC Board of Governors. On one hand, I feel that I've already paid my dues. On the other, so many horrendous stuff happened since I stepped down in 2014.
