I enjoyed participating with Steven Hallam and Jean Shoveller in the forum for @UBC -V Faculty Candidates for the Board of Governors. Video soon. I also enjoyed winning my bet with several of my colleagues as candidate Lehman failed to show up. So, I am a bit richer today.
There is good reason why I do not wear the canadian flag anymore, even though I am 3rd generation canadian and born in vancity. If you want to know my reason, ask me why. @VancouverPD @JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan @MichaelLeeBC @ChiefPalmer @RaymondLouie @ubcprez @alumniubc @UBC pic.twitter.com/aIqRySkbCO
