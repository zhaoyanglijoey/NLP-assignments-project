I was walking down the street when this Grade 3 kid points to me & shouts: "Mum, look, it's that #scientist girl from @UBC ! Remember? She said ppl w/ #ADHD like me can be scientists too! She said I'm not stupid!" Days like these make all the s*** in #academia worth it. #phdlife

Right there is the @UBC story of the last 10 years. A 45% increase in math. courses enrollment matched with 0% in faculty positions increase. And they keep raising tuition fees and asking for more funds. @charlesmenzies
You're perfectly right. I used to tell Pierre Ouillet in Board meetings that he was running @UBC like Jeff Bezos was running Amazon, who kept increasing sales while requesting that his employees run faster around the warehouses.
We're excited for Girls Learning Code Summer Design Camp in Vancouver! This camp gives Campers the opportunity to use their creativity and design skills to give companies a branding & identity make-over!

While working at @UAlberta , @UBC had made good progress. I was proud of our work at UAlberta despite several different registration systems. @UNOmaha has best of both worlds. Great for parents and one central place to sign up for multiple camps!
