The readings list has arrived, reality is setting in full-time Mom + full-time teacher + part-time Masters student this fall...any advice from my #bced @Surrey_Schools community? #BackToSchool2018 #backtowork #motivation #inspiration @UBC @UBCEduc
Nice, fresh onshore wind at @UBC . Recommend UBC loops instead of climbing North Shore Mountains. #AirQuality #AirPollution #cycling #wildfire #BCWildfires

@TransLink Bay 1 and Bay 4 at UBC are far apart and there's no lighting or help. Actually terrified in the dark given Google maps is useless. @UBC should take better care of people. Fail. Just about had a panic attack trying to navigate to the bus loop.
While I was a member of the @CPC_HQ before I went into @UBC , I still am & in fact I personally think that university made me more conservative because all the liberal leftwing professors and students. I am not an ideologue either. I've voted @bcliberals b4 provincially!

Teachers live for moments like this. A former student of mine, from Norway, was just offered his "dream job" working in the Norwegian foreign ministry. I was one of his referees, which was easy -- because there were only great things to say. #Teachers #Academia @alumniubc @UBC
