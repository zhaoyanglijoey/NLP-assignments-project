It is always an honour to spend time with @UBC Sports Medicine legend, professor Dr. Jack Taunton. As Chief Medical Officer of the #olympics2010 & Head of UBC Sports Medicine amongst his other numerous accomplishments, Dr. Taunton is a true leader. @ubc @UBCmedicine @ubcprez pic.twitter.com/eMlbhW2FPw

Canadians, over $500 million of your tax money go to education institutions @UofT and @UBC that extort their students and the public. Low paid staffers, precarious labour of sessional instructors. Defund!

That stems from @UBC Motto or Creed: Tuum Est. It's yours or It's up to you. So, yeah, having a self to protect is really quite big at UBC. However, the question why protect self above group or tribe isn't easy to navigate, beyond individual minds...
One thing I keep reflecting on about the @UBC Galloway story: If your friends are gonna conspire to get you fired, publicly shame you, tell the cops to lock you in a psych ward, and falsely accuse you of rape, then they probably weren't really your friends in the first place.
We need a full inquiry. @ubcprez @PhilipUBC and everyone else involved @UBC must be held accountable for what they have done to this innocent man.
@UBC you are a disgrace!
Thanks to PIMS @colliand and Ian Allison for setting up this talk (as well as for their indispensible help and support developing our JupyterHub + @CanvasLMS platform for @UBC Stat's Introduction to #Datascience course).
Fantastic remote talk by @yuvipanda @UBC today about the amazing work he's done @UCBerkeley with @ProjectJupyter JupyterHub, data8 and LMS integration of @edXOnline . So helpful for us (we will be doing something very similar for DSCI 100 in Jan but with @CanvasLMS )!
Visit #EduCanada , @UBC , @UofT and @UWaterloo at the @STcom Scholarships and Top Universities Fair 2018 today @SuntecSingapor until 6pm. Learn all about #studyinCanada ! pic.twitter.com/HPZ7bfNfOw
@KetihMaillard is another despicable example of the problems in Universities today. His contemptible bandwagon jumping demonstrates how far things have gone. @Laurier is just as pathetic. @UBC is another pantheon of progressive,"like speak".
Planning to study abroad? #Canada is a great destination for students with its affordable #education , #innovation , and our beautiful four seasons! To learn more, come visit us at the #EduCanada booth with @UBC @UofT and @UWaterloo at the SPH Top Schools and Scholarships Fair! pic.twitter.com/MwnYa9ZDen
