Only about rent? What r u on? Price 2 income ratios only apply 2 rentals & not purchase? What year economics do you teach? @UBC is becoming an embarrassment. I plan 2 avoid ur executive ed. As between your insatiability w foreign over local citizens & this is ut faculty??

I mean, the sunny day may have been a contributing factor, but the whole campus was impressive. @UBC , HMU if you need a new ecology prof in like 10 years.
We are proud to sponsor #nwHacks @UBC AKA the largest hackathon in Western Canada. Good luck to all the hackers @NwHacks this weekend - see you at our @Scotiabank booth. pic.twitter.com/xZbJeGpEnp

And the @UBC itself. Their catering department needs to step it up before #GPF2018 but hopefully they work on that.

Thank you. @ubcprez Bad process serves nobody. I am sorry that "many emerging women writers" at @UBC feel harmed by me. Many others, it seems, don't: quite the reverse. I have heard from them, but privately, since they fear the toxic atmosphere at @UBC Creative Writing Dept.
2) Like the one @SirWilfredLaurier did. Let the public know. Bad process does not serve complainants, as it taints the proceedings. @ubcprez If you think there should not be such an inquiry, why not? @UBC needs to clear this up.
1) As for the @UBC matter that kicked this off: If you think UBCs PROCESS -- how they went about things -- was great + should stand as an example to other universities, fine. If you think they messed up, tell @ubcprez they should have an independent inquiry into how and why.
@UBC is a taxpayer-funded institution. They have made a costly mess. "Accountability" includes accounting for how they've spent taxpayers' and donors' money.
I did not know the accused or any of the people involved at @UBC . I have no interest in "supporting" anything except fair process, which @UBC violated for both accused and complainants. They should have an independent inquiry into their own process, as @SirWilfredLaurier did.

Just like @UBC favours #foreignstudents quick cash over CDNs slow subsidies they also favour perverts over women's rights maybe? #ubcaccountable #vanpoli #cdnpoli
