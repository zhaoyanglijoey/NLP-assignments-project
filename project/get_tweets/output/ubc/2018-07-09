Hello from @UBC , the Univ of British Columbia! This large public #college focuses strongly on sustainability and 14% of the students are international! #ubctour #collegevisit
Researchers at @UBC developed a new kind of #biogenic #solar cell that converts sunlight into electricity using bacteria instead of electronics which allows it to function even under overcast skies http:// ow.ly/mhHt50hWbGx pic.twitter.com/JbNJz8ADUc
Researchers at @UBC find bacteria-powered solar cell that converts light to energy, even under overcast skies. http:// bit.ly/2KQ0hVJ
Hooray France, where research seminar rooms are available for @UBC mathematicians! It sure helps that over there, university presidents and their VPs are still elected by rank-and-file faculty. @ubcmath
Retweeted Vikas Swarup ( @VikasSwarup ): The impressive Chan Centre at @UBC reverberates with the rhythms of Bharatnatyam performed by Kiruthika Rathanaswami as the 17th World Sanskrit Conference gets underway pic.twitter.com/iKYm4Wl1TE
It is not easy to work @UBC . There is constant mechanical noise: construction, movie filming, pressure washing, leaf blowing, trucks reversing. No wonder this place is empty of faculty in the summer. I can't think!!!!!!!!!!!!
