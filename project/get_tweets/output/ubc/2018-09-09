Well, been a bit inactive here as of late, but that's because I've started my second year at @UBC ! Very excited to be majoring in Computer Science, being able to learn what I'm passionate in! I'm busy now, but it's a nice kind of busy. Hope everyone else is doing well too!

TBH I went to @queensu for undergrad. Frosh week was awesome there. @UBC could do a much better job on that front. Plus it eases everyone into the school year (& builds school spirit). Cha Gheill!
