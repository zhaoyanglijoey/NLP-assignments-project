An excellent first half of the year for #HelsinkiLaw & @HCollegium former colleagues and @Law_Cult_Huma friends. Monica Lopez Lerma tenured at @Reed_College_ earlier, and now Julen Etxabe offered Canada Research Chair at @UBC . Very happy for both.
Before the application of research, before the patent, ethics review, donations or grants, there is a person with a desire to discover. Meet the Canada Research Chairs in @UBC _Arts . http:// ow.ly/pihG30jSqGt pic.twitter.com/hnJ81C2JPD

Spending a lot of money on university is a scam. I would never give up my experience at university. But then I went to school @UBC and it cost $2,500 a year then. Psychotic business model needs to get out of higher education

Yes agreed. The price of US education is so outrageous. I paid $2,500 at year @UBC which is very high on the list of best schools worldwide. The amount that education costs is the disgrace & sham of higher education. Everyone runs the same revenue generating models. Sigh.
