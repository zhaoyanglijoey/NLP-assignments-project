Frances, this happened to me this past weekend while attending the apple festival. I waited 10 minutes in line to buy parking and when I returned to my vehicle I had a violation ticket on my windshield. This is so wrong @ubcprez @ubcnews @UBC
During this time, my therapist (on @UBC campus, free! It was an EXCELLENT resource btw) told me to get exercise to combat the stress, sleeping problems, and PTSD from the domestic violence incident. I jogged to West Point Grey a lot.
The prof at UBC that I fangirl for has a twitter, so naturally I had to jump on the bandwagon #noticeme @UBC
