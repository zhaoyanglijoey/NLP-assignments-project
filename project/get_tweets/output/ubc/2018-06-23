Unacceptable decision by AMS and @UBC . Been on several panels w/SASC and their ethic on violence is expansive, inclusive, survivor centered. Given rampant rape culture condoned by UBC, having space that is not proximal to institutional authority is vital! #SaveTheSASC #vanpoli
Ordination to priesthood of Sharon Smith, our clinical faculty@UBC-OSOT, @UBCmedicine , @ubc . Congratulations Rev. Smith pic.twitter.com/anOVvPJeo9
She's a @UBC , @UCalgary , and @OsgoodeNews alum. Also, she's a swell gal. @LawDeanHolloway .
A couple more pictures from action @UBC today. Gerald McGAvin Rugby Centre is host to a good one! #bcrugby #RAF100 #BearsvRAF @UBCThunderbirds pic.twitter.com/r16ZiGDWyK
If @UBC bows to this activist muzzling freedom of speech then they in fact breaching s. 2(b) of the Charter. Preventing others from speaking is not freedom of speech. pic.twitter.com/Ein9TXjADu
How can we successfully retain #WomenInEngineering ? Engendering Engineering Success, a project by @UBC , @UAIberta , and @uofg back in 2014 released two studies that address this topic, and we summarized it for you here: http:// i.sfu.ca/bfozEZ #RaisingTheBar #INWED18 pic.twitter.com/87O718fG8v
After the year you've had, closing existing supports really seems like a good idea, @ubc ? This alumnus is not proud #SaveTheSASC
@AMS_UBC @UBC I stand with the SASC and I support choices for survivors. The SASC offers important and necessary services for survivors at UBC. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
@AMS_UBC @UBC #SaveTheSASC plz
This is not only horrific, but so backwards and egregious a decision; so irresponsible and deeply misogynist a move, @UBC . Explain yourselves. This decision is a boon to #rapeculture and #victimblaming . I am sickened at this news. #Ibelievesurvivors #metoo #UBC #SaveTheSASC
Shame! @UBC and @AMS_UBC for the unilateral decision to close the SASC without centering the needs of survivors. @ubcprez are u aware of this decision? UBC Board of Governors, update Policy 131, 2.2 to add the SASC as a key partner/collaborator. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
It has been really wonderful to host Dr. Fredrik Bengtsson from @lunduniversity here @UBCmedicine this week. Lots of wonderful potential for #meded and #tech collaborations. @u21news @ubc @ubc_eml pic.twitter.com/FEVt9MnCRX
Appalled and outraged that SASC services are being discontinued. There are too many stories of institutions cutting corners trying to save face. Independent services provide accountability and are a more approachable option for survivors. #SavetheSASC @AMS_UBC @UBC
reading @ubc 's policy on sexual assault and this point sticks out for the wrong reasons: once SASC's support services are cut by @AMS_UBC , vancouver r*pe relief, an org with a history of violence against trans folks, will be a 1st point of contact in SVPRO referrals #SaveTheSASC pic.twitter.com/4zxOWzkLcb
Can @AMS_UBC guarantee to me that the new service is going to be as welcoming to the moniroties as SASC is? I am a queer and gender variant individual. I trust SASC to have our backs which I can't always say about @UBC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors
When I was an organizer for @PrideUBC I proposed that UBC begin running workshops for all students about sexual assault & gender/sexuality inclusion on campus. The SASC provided many resources and helped support this project. @UBC of course said NO to the workshops #SaveTheSASC

things like sexual health & wellbeing & healthy relationships, which frankly I don't see from any other ams or ubc group/program. I'm disappointed and angry that @AMS_UBC and @UBC have decided to elimate it without any input from the SASC #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors (2/2)
@AMS_UBC @UBC I've volunteered at the SASC for the past 2 years and have always felt comforted by the supportive environment the other volunteers and support workers have provided. The SASC does crucial work around campus such as educating others on (1/2)
