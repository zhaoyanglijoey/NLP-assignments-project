@UBC this is apparently a student at your university from what he has told me in the past, he is known for his racist hate speech and online aggression. This is just one example of it pic.twitter.com/Ao8EsMGC6f

Spending a lot of money on university is a scam. I would never give up my experience at university. But then I went to school @UBC and it cost $2,500 a year then. Psychotic business model needs to get out of higher education
Malachi 3:1 "See, I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come," says the LORD Almighty. @UBC

G7 Multistakholder exchange on Human Centric AI for our Societies http:// ow.ly/QNwI30jXKYk How is BC #AIPolicy doing? #bcpoli #bcjobs #bced @UBC @SFU
Yes agreed. The price of US education is so outrageous. I paid $2,500 at year @UBC which is very high on the list of best schools worldwide. The amount that education costs is the disgrace & sham of higher education. Everyone runs the same revenue generating models. Sigh.
Guides will be exploring #Engineering @UBC @engcite tomorrow #STEM #abetterworldbygirls
