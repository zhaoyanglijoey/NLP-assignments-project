"Diseases that were once looked at in isolation are now looked at through an interdisciplinary lens - we can leverage what we learn from one disease, to another, to accelerate progress." - Dr. Vesna Sossi, @UBC PET Director. #WorldAlzheimersDay pic.twitter.com/LMMEFhEbBY
My @Ubc health mentors students & I had a great session last night. So exciting to hear how they are progressing in their training. They all expressed how much they are going to miss each other. (We have 1 session left.) I am really going to miss them too. They are exceptional.
