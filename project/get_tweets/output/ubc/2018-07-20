Thank you! Would be extremely interested in any future searches by @UBC !
Just bumped onto @UBC #News and omg! I am amazed how they report things which other stations don't even seem to know. E.g. @RuhakanaR receiving U.N. undersecretary. Some improvement ... well done! @UgandaMediaCent @edtabaro @birikano @ubcnews @JoelSsenyonyi

RT if you think the Broadway Skytrain extension should go all the way to @UBC Funding aside, it's dumb this isn't being done right the first time. #vanpoli
And what a pleasure it was to meet the students' representatives on the @UBC Board. Their full and deep engagement in the university affairs makes my (reluctant) come back all worthwhile.
Make your way to @UBC Bookstore Plaza for the biggest blueberry fest ever: blueberry pancake breakfast, baked goods and of course, lotsa blueberries for sale! @604Now @myvancity
Looking forward to going back to @UBC tomorrow. Always nice to visit my one of my #academic homes away from home. I hope that the #school continues to inspire me, and all those who are fortunate to call themselves #students there.
