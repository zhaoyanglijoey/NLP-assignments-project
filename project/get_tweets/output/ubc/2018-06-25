@AMS_UBC @UBC I would never recommend UBC to a prospective student without the support the SASC provides, and I will be sure to explicitly tell my next class of students to avoid it entirely. I implore you to reconsider this decision.
@AMS_UBC @UBC Your choice to close the SASC is horrendous. Why would you rob vulnerable students of the support they need? This will do nothing but harm your students and deeply impact your reputation. #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
show your students that you care more about their safety and not your reputation #SaveTheSASC #ChoicesForSurvivors @UBC @AMS_UBC

I don't know if criminal charges are possible, but I really hope Galloway sues the false accusers for every penny they have. They are vile - and that includes @UBC and @ubccrwr .
@ubc prides itself on being a safe place. but ubc, like many other institutions, is not free of rape culture. the decision to close the SASC is not a safe decision. it is a harmful one. #SavetheSASC #ChoicesforSurvivors
Hey @UBC I'm trying to work with my son on choosing courses. Couldn't the course listing page also have columns for seats available and total capacity? pic.twitter.com/YztvQNW3Dj
As a @UBC alum, and former president of @GRSJUndergrads I am so disappointed by the decision to cut support services from the SASC. I am so ashamed of my former university. #savethesasc
