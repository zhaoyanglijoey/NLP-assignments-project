There's also the little details like how the new bus loop ridiculously has rain shelters only where the buses sit out of service, and not at most of the actual stops along the road where students wait in the rain for the 41, 43, 480 etc. Such poor planning @UBC ...
Not directly, I will give you that, but the way this plays out in Canada at @UBC for example is that some professors in the Native Studies department, for example, forbid students to deny the existence of aboriginal land title because that's "colonialism and racism."
