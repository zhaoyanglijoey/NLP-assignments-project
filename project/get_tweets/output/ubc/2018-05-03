@UBC hi hello, I am still wondering when we will get that yes or no email? I will accept a tweet back with a or at this point. Thank you and happy Thursday
Someone needs to teach the clowns in the bookstore to reply to the emails they receive. It's shocking how many staff @UBC can't do the basics of their job...a ton of tax payer money wasted there. @ubcprez

As junior faculty @UBC I was recruited to Assoc Prof @JohnsHopkinsSPH . My advisor relentlessly punished me b4 I left. A yr later @AbernsteinCIFAR asked me to give a keynote as the agency that funded me was ending. My theme was mentorship, my advisor in the front row squirming.

Yes, you could easily read between the lines that "athletics" were behind all the intrigue and shenanigans at Tennessee. We will make sure that @UBC stays (relatively) immune from such a culture.

This @UBC ad on the train features an adorable therapy dog, but if your selling point is that students get to touch an animal once a year so they are less inclined to kill themselves, you may need to rethink campus amenities.
So it's totally fine for me to spend a whole lot of money every month to rent a space that isn't that great and doesn't really meet my needs but is vaguely near @ubc but a slight tax increase on people who have enormous wealth merits a freak out? #vanpoli #bcpoli
