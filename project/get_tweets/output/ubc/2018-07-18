In any case, I had an extremely fruitful meeting with the Chair of the @UBC Board, Michael Korenberg. I have hopes for a more inclusive governance that will restore the role of the UBC-V faculty at this institution. Plus, I happen to like self-made people.
When elected to @UBC Board in 2008, the Board chair, the president, the provost and the Chancellor wrote and reached out immediately. Only one of the four did this time around. Is it the American/British way?
