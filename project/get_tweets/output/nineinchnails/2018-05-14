I love this announcement. Heads up, #ticketing world! http:// nin.com/tickets2018 via @nineinchnails #ColdAndBlackAndInfinite
Hey @trent_reznor / @nineinchnails , I love the way you're doing tickets for the new tour but as an Ohioan, we would happily road trip to #Nashvegas to see yall, but we can't get tix before hand. That sucks for us but at the same time, fuck Ticketmaster. Can't wait for #HALO32 !

re-visited With Teeth by @nineinchnails for the first time in a good while this morning and now am angry at myself for not listening to it for so long. real great album.

@nineinchnails admire what you're doing with ticketing it's different, what's in place to stop those tickets at the box office being resold? Guess it could make the situation worse, many touts make their income reselling and don't have jobs so can spend all day at the box office?
Nine Inch Nails: novo ep Bad Witch em junho @nineinchnails @nineinchnails_ http://www. playbackfc.com.br/?p=17455
Always and forever my favorite @nineinchnails album. I listen to the new ones, but this one is just such raw emotion and beautiful sound to me. Also where this #metalhead was born! pic.twitter.com/q2f2lZglSb
