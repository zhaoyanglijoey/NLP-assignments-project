@nineinchnails So i said you guys just do that one thing you do when someone has tried to steal someone in your family..like Trents kids were in there with their setter @Portisheadinfo ... @FBI you are not shitting us? so someone just stole his cars and vehicles ? yes you seen it
Still dazzled by the intense show of @nineinchnails yesterday in @AFASLive #nin #afaslive #nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/gjRL0GKmLG
#RIP Pat. Saw @nineinchnails w/ him in 2000. After the show he waited in the rain behind the stadium, in the off chance he might meet @trent_reznor . It happened, and Pat got to share a moment w/ a man who had helped define his life. Thx, Trent, for giving him that moment. pic.twitter.com/WLCA6tWWin

I love the new @NineInchNails record. @Trent_Reznor and Atticus Ross have nailed it once again. Every time they come back, they do it BIG. #BadWitch

@RYANGEE_photo Yo Gee! Listen to @nineinchnails 'Not The Actual Events', 'Add Violence' & 'Bad Witch' all in a row as a trilogy. You'll appreciate the concept as a complete album. Let me know what you think. I think it's a masterpiece by @trent_reznor

The new @nineinchnails LP is pretty sick. I like it. Very noisy.
If your knowledge of @nineinchnails begins and ends with "The Downward Spiral", give these lesser-known albums a listen before checking out their new one: http:// bit.ly/2N6gpR4

@frontiertouring is there a @nineinchnails Aus tour in the offing? Any chance of bringing @TheMaryChain too or is only america worthy of such awesomeness?
The new @nineinchnails album is bloody excellent.
I just heard original "Dead Souls" track from them and it's great. @nineinchnails did a great cover as well for #TheCrow SDTK
