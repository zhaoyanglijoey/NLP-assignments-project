The first thing I did with my now working laptop is blast @GreenDay , @AFI , @nineinchnails , and @NOFXband
They are punk rock fans, thex wouldn't go there. Fight me! They hold hands to @paramore music and fuck to @nineinchnails closer.

Maness' trio's song selections run the gamut from @Outkast to @radiohead to @nineinchnails , alongside more expected jazz standards. http:// ow.ly/Wdag30iFITi
[Instagram] THEN MY HEAD, FELL APART, AND WHERE WERE YOU? @nineinchnails 08/20/2013 London, Scala - Somewhat Damaged. I wish there was a full recording of this gig. The footage here is the epitome of why I love NIN live so much. Pure intensity. https:// instagram.com/p/BfvnhTGHBVa/ pic.twitter.com/ojHxkDyy6V

@nineinchnails The Downward Spiral
Funnily enough @nineinchnails and a bunch of other 'dark' music genres and my goth phase. 25 years later and i still listen to it

@nineinchnails The Downward Spiral - Heresy, March of the Pigs, Closer.
The Downward Spiral by @nineinchnails is the greatest album of all time for me. No contest, no close second. Fuck, it's so good!
Is @nineinchnails describing: A. Two or more nails that are nine inches long? OR B. Exactly nine nails that are one inch long? Discuss.
li ascolto sempre con @nineinchnails e @marilynmanson i Queen Metallica Sepultura ecc ecc
Classic Rocks 100 greatest albums of the 90s. Position 95 Blue album by @Weezer 92 Downward Spiral by @nineinchnails its making me doubt the veracity of the list.

I love the #Westworld soundtrack SO MUCH! I'm obsessed with it right now. Such a great collection of songs. From @RollingStones @theCure @Radiohead #AmyWinehouse and @nineinchnails , to make just a few. #SOAWESOME
i still have no idea what to do with this @nineinchnails essay. I joined reddit because i think i might post it there, but...
I noticed a street lamp pole ad for @nineinchnails was displayed shortly in the @hallmarkchannel movie #PumpkinPieWars
Happy 10th to this amazing concept album: @nineinchnails #GhostsIIV I owe so much to this release - the approach, the accompanying art and the arrangements of riffs. Highly underrated and the beginnings of the soundtrack love affair for both me & Mr. Reznor, my spirit animal pic.twitter.com/8DFptXSU1F
@ArcaneRoots , @GrumbleBeeUK , @Heisskaltmusik , @Refused , The Dirty Nil, @codeorangekids , @nineinchnails , Death Grips, @thisisletlive , @everytimeidie ... No idea what style you are looking for :)

The only reason I'm working today is so I can buy more @nineinchnails merchandise.
Worked in the yard for 3.5 hours this morning. Doing laundry, paying bills and listening to @nineinchnails .
