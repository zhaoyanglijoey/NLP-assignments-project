Really fucking annoyed that the white vinyl for @nineinchnails ' new album was limited and sold out whilst I was at work. Like just do a general goddamn release
With "God Break Down the Door", @nineinchnails has found themselves apart from their former life. Listen: https:// bit.ly/2KzU506 pic.twitter.com/jMaTEkcJC3
Awesome, so because we're 2500 miles from home and they are only selling tickets in person (???) on Saturday, we get to miss the @nineinchnails presale, and therefore the concert. Awesome.
. @nineinchnails makes dark glorious, muddy frenetic return with haunting saxophone infused God Break Down The Door as they prepare to release new album Bad Witch... https:// tmblr.co/ZrBv0x2Y3OWWM
Interesting direction for @nineinchnails . Jazz instrumentation + troubadour vocals from @trent_reznor . Definitely hear the David Bowie influence. Is industrial jazz a thing? #np Nine Inch Nails - God Break Down The Door https:// youtu.be/eeJ_DzRJUI4 #nowplaying

Happy birthday to Trent Reznor of @nineinchnails , Trent, you get more bad ass with age....keep blowing us fans away with ground breaking music! If Mozart were alive today, he would be a NIN fan!
My heart is falling into my toes and my skin is lifting. My hairs are infiltrating back into my scalp one follicle at a time. @nineinchnails is coming to dc.
