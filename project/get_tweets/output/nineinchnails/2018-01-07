Our dad took us to see @nineinchnails live a few years back. But our love for NIN started when we were babies. He took a video of us at 2 with socks on our hands rocking out to NIN! Cool Dads are the best!!
#SomewhatDamaged @nineinchnails #NowListening How could I ever think it's funny how everything you swore would never change, is different now? Like you said: "You and me, make it through." Didn't quite. Fell apart. Where the fuck were you?
The new @jtimberlake song Filthy is a mashup of @muse Madness & @nineinchnails Closer. https:// youtu.be/gA-NDZb29I4

So....I found this. All this time I was sure @tmorello side project was playing and instead it was @nineinchnails ?! Can you imagine how much worse my memory would be if I'd ever done drugs? pic.twitter.com/EMEdWy1guz
