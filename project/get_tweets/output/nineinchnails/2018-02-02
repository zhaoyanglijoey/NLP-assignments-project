@lostinvegas83 Love you guys, keep up the great work. "Through the Fire and Flames" by @DragonForce "Hurt" by @nineinchnails
A select few. "Last Ninja II" for the C64 by @mattgrayc64 . Recently re-recorded with modern instruments. But the original still rocks. "Rise of the Triad" by @leejacksonaudio . "Quake" by @nineinchnails and "Quake II" by @sonicmayhem -- two very different kick-ass OSTs.
