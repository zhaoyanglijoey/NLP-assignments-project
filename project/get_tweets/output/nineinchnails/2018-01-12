Sometimes, when I listen to @nineinchnails , I end up pausing the music and listening to the sound of my own madness for a bit... This can't be just me.

Last night I heard Royals by @lorde mashed up w @nineinchnails Closer & it was Very Cool
Okay - you've got my attention with #AlteredCarbon , @netflix - dark scifi (dark cyberpunk), a TV series based on a book series by Richard Morgan, visuals that give Blade Runner a run for it's money, @nineinchnails as background music. Let's hope this won't be canceled mid-run
@ladykier @ToolPusciferAPC @Bootsy_Collins @mjkeenan @nineinchnails A heartfelt apology to all the peeps I follow from the US. If Brexit was the catalyst that has brought acceptance of racist sexist world leaders and far right majorities

It's honestly depressing that whilst Year Zero by @nineinchnails was written during the Bush Administration it sounds more reactive to today's political landscape than that of ten years ago.
PS-I was introduced to your father's music from watching a @nineinchnails home video (the band were getting ready while listening to "Broken Hearts Are for Assholes"-my favorite song). So, this is somewhat like an unorthodox full-circle of sorts for me. Very cool! Thank you!
