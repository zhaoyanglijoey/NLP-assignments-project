Trent Reznor aka Nine Inch Nails es el mejor artista de la decada del '90. Por la musica / arte escenica / innovacion / estilo de la epoca y como repercutio en el mundo. Y a nivel historico lo pongo entre los mejores 10, que tipo crack. @nineinchnails

This is what happens when I talk about a certain @nineinchnails show in #Detroit back in 1990 on Facebook. I mentioned how it was the one and only time I saw a guy stage-dive from the balcony into the crowd at @StAndrewsHall . pic.twitter.com/1uFiZiuwuM
