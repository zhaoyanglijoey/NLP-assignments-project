@numanofficial a few years back in Orlando with @nineinchnails on Halloween
In a @nineinchnails listening mood today
Hey @trent_reznor @nineinchnails @IlanRubin , I Bet "You Know What You Are" From WITH TEETH Would Sound Awesome In Nashville @Ascend_amp Outdoors Along The River And Ilan Is The Perfect Drummer For This!!! Been TOO Long Since Hearing This LIVE!!!
State decided to do roadwork during rush hour. So it is @nineinchnails The Fragile for the ride home.
@nineinchnails play Last & Heresy #Nashville #PrettyPlease pic.twitter.com/RJbkVnr1t9
I came home today and caught my 14 yr old listening to @nineinchnails . This was likely my proudest parenting moment. @Xspyder77X
Oh @nineinchnails your music always helps the rage inside.
Def Leppard and Pat Benatar have always struck me as being overlooked. But what about @thecure , @officialcult , and especially @nineinchnails ? And @LivingColour ??
This kid with the loud game and loud talking gives me right to play @nineinchnails , right?
There are just three shows left at @Ascend_amp this season! Catch @nineinchnails tomorrow night, and @phish with back-to-back shows next month. : mc_anderson pic.twitter.com/zVuRh3CvkY
When i finally gave up my 15 year old Jeep Wrangler to buy a shiny new Mazda, i left a @nineinchnails disc in the CD player. I didn't really think about who might find it; more like, i felt bad about abandoning an old friend and wanted to leave her with some good music.
"The Fragile" by @nineinchnails is one of my favorite albums to rediscover every time I find it again.
ICYMI @nineinchnails recently broke out "The Perfect Drug" for the first time at @RedRocksCO - WATCH video: http:// ow.ly/ULYZ30lVrP5 pic.twitter.com/XgKYc9t21E
