Falto @nineinchnails
I hear you, @CapRadioNews , playing "The Background World" by @nineinchnails in your station identification break from @pritheworld <3
Recently, Mr. Self Destruct, on The Downward Spiral, by @nineinchnails , has been melting my eardrums.
Am I really about to drive from Tucson to Vegas to see @nineinchnails alone because all my friends are fake as fuck?
We're pushing over an hour here. Boring chit chat about their culinary habits. They're dragging out convos. Nothing left to talk about but neither wants to leave just yet? Update. Her Spotify songs consist mostly of the band Nine Inch Nails @nineinchnails
Day 6 of 10 - 10 all-time favorite albums that made a big impact and are still on your rotation list, even if rarely. Post the cover, no need to explain and nominate a person each day to do the same. @trent_reznor @nineinchnails #nin pic.twitter.com/SUs79ZXZnR
well it's about time I'm going to see @nineinchnails in June. pic.twitter.com/DEpV5PeDLF
Yeah they were dead good. When I saw @gunsnroses previously @wembleystadium with @nineinchnails G n R put on an epic amazing show, maybe they were having an off day or begining to self destruct. But after Maine Road all their records and stuff went to the charity shop
Might have a spare ticket for @nineinchnails at @meltdownfest if the bestie can't make it (I'll still be going) - WATCH THIS SPACE
