@nineinchnails you were quite simply breathtaking @NOS_Alive , thank you so much. One of my all time favourite live shows.
It's always interesting to see Persian texts especially in form of #calligraphy at places you least expect it, like on hands of Gary Numan in @nineinchnails 's clip "Metal".
@nineinchnails - Hurt (clip) from @NOSAlive2018 . <3 <3 <3 <3
Re siento que "we are in this together" de @nineinchnails re puede sonar cuando #Gokuh tira una genki-dama. (aunque aguante Vegeta y todo lo que se refiere al principe de los guachos)
It reminds me of the marketing done for @nineinchnails Year Zero.
@KenBurns & @trent_reznor "The Vietnam War" is the best War documentary i have ever seen. so detailed and told from so many sides. well done. #vietnamwar a sprinkling of @nineinchnails in it also is perfect. #nineinchnails
@nineinchnails knew how to light up #NOSAlive18 and put a great show even when 90% of the people weren't there to see them. In lack of people singing along to their songs, I sang my heart out and Trent noticed (that eye contact). Thank you for an amazing show. #BestShowInMyLife

The Fragile by @nineinchnails is the best album ever recorded. Hands down.
There was this incredible moment in the mid-1990s when @nineinchnails and @DavidBowieReal performed a series of shows together. Their rendition of DB's Hallo Spaceboy is my current addiction... "This chaos is killing me" in the best possible way: https:// youtu.be/1X6KF1IkkIc

I hate living in a @nineinchnails concept album
For me, it wasn't emo but 90s Alternative (which I still love). I listen to both @BTS_twt and @nineinchnails on a daily basis. The connection? A spectrum of intelligent angst, commentary and stunning visuals. And yes, eyeliner.
