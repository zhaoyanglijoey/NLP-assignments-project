I listened to a little @nineinchnails in between, but it was mostly Goodbye & Good Riddance.

Dat was best fijn @nineinchnails in @AFASLive Ik vond het 4jaar geleden beter, Het geluid was snoeihard. #bloedende oren #NIN #AFAS pic.twitter.com/s0qmOpNWGI
It was pure magic happening right before our eyes. The band has such a great energy, i'm so so so glad I got to witness this, and I hope I will many more times. Thank you for coming, it means the world @trent_reznor @nineinchnails
Wow. Had the best concert experience of my life in Amsterdam seeing @nineinchnails @trent_reznor for the first time. Never seen such a chill but alive crowd and I couldn't have asked for a better setlist. The bits of Trump talking nonsense in The Great Destroyer were just genius
Great show from @nineinchnails at @AFASLive tonight!
Just saw @nineinchnails live! Best light show I've ever seen! Sound was great and the setlist was awesome pic.twitter.com/mQglFtNCUG
It's been a few days but I still can't stop thinking about Sunday night and how incredible it was. [ @nineinchnails at the @RoyalAlbertHall , royally kicking ass] pic.twitter.com/Sk69JfSJRA
Venues in the UK that hold 5,000+ should have a chat with the guys at @AFASLive . The sound for tonight's @nineinchnails show was superb. Crisp, clear and LOUD. Brixton Academy I'm looking at you. #nineinchnails
Wow, wat een concert weer van @nineinchnails vanavond. Zoals gehoopt een mooie collectie nieuwe nummers gehoord. Benieuwd naar optreden op @RockWerchter pic.twitter.com/f43PYaNEKG
All the love. @nineinchnails @trent_reznor pic.twitter.com/ycl65p11Yf
Nummer 7 was net zo goed als de voorgaande keren. De band die ik het meest zag: @nineinchnails #nin pic.twitter.com/i4bvAuzZGy

#TrentReznor should say @KanyeWest and @TheWeeknd "drew inspo" from @NineInchNails live shows, everything is inspiration - #NME http:// po.st/ZV3oho via @NME
