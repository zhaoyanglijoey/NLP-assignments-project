Rendering video and listening to Nine Inch Nails @nineinchnails
"Brain Damage" by @pinkfloyd is fingerpicking exercise song this quarter. Was quiet at school, so jammed in the waiting area instead of the practice rooms and got a small audience. Practiced creating some @nineinchnails style beats on @Ableton afterwards.
Got the pre-sale email to buy tix for @nineinchnails in Amsterdam. Seriously contemplated how much I would need to sell to make that trip happen.
This evenings vibes..... A bit of living room dancing to @nineinchnails
When @nineinchnails gives your auto focus a run for its money another fast paced strobe, darkness heavy gig. I think this might have been one of my first gigs at @pertharena as well! http:// ift.tt/2E71hye pic.twitter.com/hyzhqk4Qfw
