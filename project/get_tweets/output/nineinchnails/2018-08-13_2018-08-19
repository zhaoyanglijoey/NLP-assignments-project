#MusicMonday I forget just how much I like Nine Inch Nails until someone plays a song or recites a lyric and BOOM, I gotta dive into a playlist or two. @trent_reznor made so many great & timeless tracks. I am really enjoying revisiting my @nineinchnails collection right now.

My all time favorite album is definitely the downward spiral. 1994. I could listen to it from start to finish every single day. Still holds up for me. So many great feelings and emotions from this album. @nineinchnails
