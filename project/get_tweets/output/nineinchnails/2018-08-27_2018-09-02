Not surprised at all that @trent_reznor is a seer. 2007's Year Zero feels like current day, end times nihilist guidebook. Loved it then and now. @rob_sheridan @nineinchnails https:// youtu.be/YfzrE-nudhg

"Better" is the best song from Chinese Democracy. @nineinchnails guitarist Robin Finck should have written the entire album.

Fans criticize With Teeth as @nineinchnails "poppiest" project, but it's a solid synth-rock album, stans just get salty about their favorite band's Top 40 success and the appearance of new fans who were brought in by a more accessible singles.
@nineinchnails is #life

My vote is @nineinchnails
I wore mine to a @nineinchnails concert. Which was great. Only one with this shirt there though!

I think it should involve a big band group followed by @nineinchnails singing Starfuckers for 24hrs.
And he followed it up with @nineinchnails !!! Amazing
