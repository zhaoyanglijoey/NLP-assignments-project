@AragonBallroom Hello. Regarding the @nineinchnails sale next week, is there a place where fans can form an informal, controlled line before 8:00am? I know a lot of the fan community is worried about getting outnumbered by scalpers and their "employees."
@nineinchnails is really helping me deal with life right now, so thanks Trent. pic.twitter.com/rwtZkD7hlh
@nineinchnails Your tour is showing two dates for physical sales in Denver. Is May 19 a special date for certain people? Thanks
. @nineinchnails is making you buy tickets in person if you want to see them on tour. https:// sixxsen.se/2IbC1ss

@trent_reznor @nineinchnails Please make the name on the purchaser's ticket policy known to the public before the 19th so that Stub hub won't have the option to pay ppl to wait in line and take all the fans tix away from us. Thanks for fighting 3rd party scalping.
@trent_reznor @nineinchnails Please make the walk up ticket policy for the 19th have the purchaser's name on them. (Hand written and initialed if they can't be printed) The purchaser has to be present at the time of entry with ID otherwise Stub hub will hire people to camp out.
@nineinchnails @trent_reznor BAR none!
Chulada @nineinchnails Bien dicho!!!
You guys I'm serious why aren't we being told how much the @nineinchnails tickets are? I can't take time off work if I can't afford the tickets I have to physically wait in line for. TRENT CHECK YOUR PRIV.
