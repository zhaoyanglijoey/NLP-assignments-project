The whole "Bad Witch" album is fantastic. I'm hearing a lot of new genres and influences I don't normally hear in a @nineinchnails recording #CanYouDigIt #BadWitch
Bad Witch is a brilliant record in its own right; dark, abrasive & the homage to Bowie is such a big part of it, that the album might not even exist if he were still here. The perfect way for @nineinchnails to close this trilogy.
@nineinchnails and you expect me to be calm after that FUCKING MASTERPIECE?! OH MY GOD #BADWITCH
THREE TRACKS INTO @nineinchnails BAD WITCH AND IT'S ONE OF THEIR BEST PROJECTS YET SO FAR! I love experimental Reznor, he is a mad genius. Ahead of Ourselves is fucking great!!! Can't wait for the next three (although I've already heard GBDTD)

Just submitted my review of @nineinchnails ' Bad Witch for publication tomorrow. Managed to expound upon the virtues of Reznor and Ross' six track release for over 1,700 words, so you best get hype. Oh, and no, I didn't waste words on the is it an EP or an album furore...
Thanks @nineinchnails for properly shipping out the new LP. #vinyl lovers appreciate the extra love in the packaging. Nothing worse than a having your brand new record show up damaged. #vinylrecords #NIN pic.twitter.com/DKtEXC2O1u
