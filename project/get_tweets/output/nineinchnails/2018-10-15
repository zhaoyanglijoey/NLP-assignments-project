Last night was a highlight, especially for The Lovers of The Fragile. Trent said it was a "weird setlist" but it was wonderful. Flashback to Panorama with Starman's "I Can't Give Everything Away" -- stunning. Well done @nineinchnails and thanks @RadioCity pic.twitter.com/zuk4n3zuQ8
Saw @nineinchnails in DC *and* NYC this past week. My voice is shot from screaming along and my ears are still ringing. Worth it. Thank you @trent_reznor #superfan #nin #NINONTOUR #nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/f8ULAhN1ob
I would like to personally thank @nineinchnails and @RadioCity for last night's show. Everything that was an issue the night before was improved. Sound, merch lines, beer lines and even the set list were all drastically better. Great job everyone. Thanks.
