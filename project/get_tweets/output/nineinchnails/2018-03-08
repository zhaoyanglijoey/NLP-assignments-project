Dear @trent_reznor I miss you and @nineinchnails
Go back in time & relive @nineinchnails ' performance of "Closer" during their infamous, mud-caked set at @woodstockfest 1994 -- watch here // http:// bit.ly/2Fls2Um
Incredible, angry, brutally real record that holds up against the unstoppable hands of fucking time. Thank God for @nineinchnails .
