Always thought @nineinchnails would do a great version of this.
The money is IP and intangibles can be counted as revenue and untaxed net income. At least it looks good on paper converting equity into cash is more difficult boils down to selling or the checking account equity act of 1980 and NOW accounts. @nineinchnails

The last time I saw @nineinchnails live was during the original Lollapalooza tour in 1991. I've watched nearly all major live videos on YouTube since, and I think I need to get to an Atticus Ross-supported show soon.
My October so far: - 5 days in the Poconos for #techbash - 4 days in North Carolina for work offisite - my 40th birthday - @nineinchnails concert - Halloween I'd really love to find my way to @creamcitycode , but pretty sure I'll be at max-people-exposure levels already.
That's so funny, I was just listening to @nineinchnails Hurt off The Downward Spiral for the first time in years, and I was thinking 'God Damn, this holds up!' I was getting all angsty like the good old days.

My all time favorite album is definitely the downward spiral. 1994. I could listen to it from start to finish every single day. Still holds up for me. So many great feelings and emotions from this album. @nineinchnails
It has been 2 years since we have lost James Woolley. RIP James. @nineinchnails @trent_reznor @dannylohner @robinfinck @ChrisVrenna @OfficialFilter @billyhowerdel pic.twitter.com/izwtxwW4te

If @nineinchnails ' first album was called Pretty Hat Machine, industrial music would have been less sombre, and more sombrero.

Imagine if @trent_reznor hadn't had his heart broken in the 80s. I don't believe his creativity would have been limited at all, but without all of that angst, would we have ended up with the upbeat @nineinchnails debut Pretty Great Machine? #AlternateAlternativeHistory

@IrontomBand is like a hybrid of @awolnation and @nineinchnails lite rolled into one. Saw them open for @ChiliPeppers last spring in 2017, they were mind blowing.
Nerd fact of the day: Between Laura Poitras's @Citizenfour , @LizGarbus 's THE FOURTH ESTATE & @KenBurns ' THE VIETNAM WAR, I now count at least three major docus that have used parts of @NineInchNails ' groundbreaking (& public domain) GHOSTS I-IV in their soundtracks. Any others?

Been listening to @nineinchnails stuff today. Not bad stuff. Can anyone suggest to me which pressings to listen to, because I can't really find a lot of threads on which pressings are best. I only found one thread which was on Downward Spiral.

Fans criticize With Teeth as @nineinchnails "poppiest" project, but it's a solid synth-rock album, stans just get salty about their favorite band's Top 40 success and the appearance of new fans who were brought in by a more accessible singles.
