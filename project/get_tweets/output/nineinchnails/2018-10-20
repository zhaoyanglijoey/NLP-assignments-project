My 2017 pressing of @nineinchnails The Downward Spiral is amazing. You can hear so many sonic nuances that you don't hear on digital media.
Happy Birthday, Pretty Hate Machine! One of my favorite albums of all time and still light years ahead of most music being released. 10/20/89 Thank you @trent_reznor @nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/CxOziR0CCh
Thanks @trent_reznor and @nineinchnails for another great show in Boston last night.
Nine Inch Nails @nineinchnails @kingsbklyn Brooklyn, NY, October 17, 2018. They played Broken EP in full which was fantastic; rest of the set was similar to Radio City night 1. They didn't play "The Becoming" like I hoped. See ya next time @treznor #NIN #nineinchnails #ninontour pic.twitter.com/ypiRVqKTT8
The @nineinchnails concert last night was fanfuckingtastic!!! It's been forever since I've seen them and Trent is only getting better. And hotter.
Today's the day! Join me and @thetolms at @HabitatCanada Re-Store on Devon Drive in Windsor from 11am-3pm. WIN @nineinchnails tickets and score free @TheOfficial89X swag!
Busy day ahead: @LesleyWriters event in the morning, @MassMICE in the afternoon, and @nineinchnails this evening.

So the #mid90s soundtrack from #TrentReznor and #AtticusRoss is cool, full of beautifully moody soundscapes, especially if you like the sound of pianos and atmospheric textures (as I do). Though it is short, 13 minutes long. @nineinchnails @trent_reznor @JonahHill @mid90smovie pic.twitter.com/B2hZDJx8vn
