Why is @nineinchnails so fucking AWESOME?
#HowIStayAwakeAtWork Playing @Metallica and @nineinchnails through my earbuds
Jaja! Eso es lo bueno de bandas como @nineinchnails que pueden transmitir millones de sensaciones! Ademas que el industrial es muy versatil en sus sonidos y las letras son profundas! Y genial que te gusto! Nice Day!
Bei NIN denk ich an @nineinchnails ^^

Would love to see a @B00TS + @nineinchnails collab. Someone make this a thing.

@nineinchnails are just one of those bands I go back and forth whether I love them or like them due to how weird and different some of their songs are.
May 2005 when I saw @nineinchnails at the Fillmore in Denver.
@nineinchnails the downward spiral

Who sings your favorite "Closer"? @Goapele , @KingsOfLeon , @NeYoCompound , @TheChainsmokers , or @nineinchnails ?!?!?!
@nineinchnails is the best workout music. Gets me pumped every time!
I stand by my opinion that #hurt by @nineinchnails is the superior version. Both are amazing, obviously, but they're simply about different pains. Depression is a bitch, and sometimes you just want to hurt.
I want 3 times the content of what I love...but if I had the power to demand @nineinchnails make more TDS and Perfect Drug type tracks in the late 90s, I wouldn't have had The Fragile. Such is life and learning appreciation.
Tripping out on @nineinchnails tonight. Such an amazing band!

I'm listening to "Closer" by @nineinchnails on @pandora_radio . #pandora http:// pdora.co/2ECbD9C
I'm listening to "Dead Souls" by @nineinchnails on @pandora_radio . #pandora http:// pdora.co/2FQb6kz
Since I have a music career on the side, I plan on the whole soundtrack to be made with synthesizers and Darkwave/Industrial elements inspired by the likes of @nineinchnails and @MSI .
Put together this video to show off what my Noise @noiseimplant project is all about! For fans of @nineinchnails , Front 242, Haujobb, Frontline Assembly, etc. Check it!

@nineinchnails @Slayer @slipknot
@rob_sheridan I hope I'm not bothering you by asking. But, everyone at /r/nin & @ets_org seems to want to stop until we get some sort of confirmation that it's okay to keep going down this particular rabbit hole. @42ENT says they aren't involved. @trent_reznor @nineinchnails

You leave @nineinchnails out of this, lady.
Dinosaurs are scared of kids, so they are posting @parksandrecnbc gifs, referencing @nineinchnails and @WeAreMinistry , and quoting @TheSimpsons to be #relatable - no one is buying it. @NRA @DLoesch @tedcruz , kindly #getFucked #blessed

. @Pablo_Francisco wearing a @nineinchnails patch on his jacket this morning on @WGNNews was reason alone to buy tix for his show tonight.

Which version do you like better? @nineinchnails or @JohnnyCash ? Great song!
Now listening: @nineinchnails With Teeth. Haven't listened to this album for quite a while and forgot what an absolute cracker of an album it is. Pretty much all killer no filler. #NIN #withteeth
@nineinchnails will we hear an update soon on the remaining vinyl releases? And do you think that Fixed or Ghosts will ever be repressed again? Thanks in advance!
I want Jackson Pollock to paint to @nineinchnails closer @nineinchnails_

I remember the first time I saw this video. Blew my mind. I love that sort of industrial/techno mashup. https:// buff.ly/2HtRVyL @nineinchnails

Un poco de @nineinchnails esta noche. https:// youtu.be/JujihaeDpQ0
Calling @nineinchnails and @WeAreMinistry goth pisses music fans off like calling an AR-15 an Assault Rifle pisses of gun nuts and @nra shills.
I heard that awful woman from the N R A said she was a @nineinchnails fan, which is pretty funny because even if this song wasn't written about her it certainly could have been https:// youtu.be/nOVW938sr0k

Hey @trent_reznor , is it weird to be a @nineinchnails AND a @PhilCollinsFeed fan?
I'm rioting anyway!!! @joanjett is blasting at the moment. @nineinchnails playlist is ready...
Florida right now @nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/V2zDFpJdnI
Their song reminded me of the magnificent @nineinchnails - wonder if they have influenced him like he must surely have influenced them?
I think I just cracked a @nineinchnails production code. Those last 7min of The Background World, where clips keep getting re-fed through analog gear to build up distortion, are all stacked up and then quickly crossfaded through during the last minute or so of the actual song!
@lostinvegas83 Guys! Thanks to some fellow bastards in a @primus FB group I happened upon you two. My wife and I have been hooked since then. W/ that said gotta throw my cpl bands missing from your reactions for ur consideration @nineinchnails , @dillingerescpln , @WeAreMinistry .
I had pandora on & it had been pretty quiet. I opened a cnn article and the video started playing automatically (annoying). Right as #Rubio begins to speak the opening riff of #reptile by @nineinchnails overwhelms his words it it looks like it is coming out of his mouth.

If there's one thing I want to happen before I die, it's a cover of Styx's Mr. Roboto by @nineinchnails
One of my favorite things to do is to rediscover old music albums that I have not heard in years. Today it was Pretty Hate Machine by @nineinchnails by far one of the best albums ever made. #music #masterpiece
Looks like something taken from a @nineinchnails show
