I bet @nineinchnails are delighted with this.
After years of mostly hearing the Johnny Cash version of "Hurt", the @nineinchnails version sounds like the cover at this point.
Listening to @nineinchnails 1) Wish 2) Terrible Lie 3) Closer 4) Something I Can Never Have 5) The Hand That Feeds You 6) March Of The Pigs 7) With Teeth

I used to love award shows.. Maybe somewhere between not giving a shit made me stop. But truthfully it was when @nineinchnails and Queens of the Stone Age got cut off short during their performance in one of the music awards in 2013 or 2014... I kept my promise. #NeverForget

Writer types and creatives... what do you listen to while you work? Im not productive in silence or with lyrics. Lately I've been loving @ratatatmusic and @nineinchnails .. but my mood setting ride or dies are @WondrousSound or any @DAVID_LYNCH soundtrack. pic.twitter.com/eoblug6jSV
