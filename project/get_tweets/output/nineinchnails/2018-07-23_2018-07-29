In this shit soup of a world we live in right now, listening to @nineinchnails has never felt more comforting. Love how this band manages to evoke all the right emotions at just the right times.
Sometimes the nihilist in me just needs some old @nineinchnails playing.

So excited to share my new #modularsynth track 'Under the Glove' with you! I recorded this yesterday very early morning before going off to a mate's wedding ;-) This rather sinister track was inspired by @nineinchnails :-) #womeninmusic #eurorack #modular https:// youtu.be/rY9LbyFmyag
Waiting to get into @WeAreMinistry @swxbristol Soundcheck running late. Everyone herded into upstairs bar. Listening to @nineinchnails Pretty Hate Machine on repeat. Lots of men in shorts.
I think we are living @nineinchnails Year Zero .

@sternshow @nineinchnails @robertAbooey @HowardStern @jdharm @Siriusjay @shalomshuli @rqui @trent_reznor listen to The Fragile, the entire album, this weekend. Try to pay attention to the story. #NIN #ninontour
The Fragile by @nineinchnails is the best album ever recorded. Hands down.
There was this incredible moment in the mid-1990s when @nineinchnails and @DavidBowieReal performed a series of shows together. Their rendition of DB's Hallo Spaceboy is my current addiction... "This chaos is killing me" in the best possible way: https:// youtu.be/1X6KF1IkkIc
I listened @nineinchnails a few weeks ago in Berlin and was an excellent performance!
i definitely just blew my car speakers listening to @nineinchnails
@grantmorrison Can you please make a new Heavy Metal movie happen, along with some great music, such as @nineinchnails and @threeteeth ?
@nineinchnails What's up?

Bad Witch de @nineinchnails es un verdadero tributo a @DavidBowieReal

I hate living in a @nineinchnails concept album
For me, it wasn't emo but 90s Alternative (which I still love). I listen to both @BTS_twt and @nineinchnails on a daily basis. The connection? A spectrum of intelligent angst, commentary and stunning visuals. And yes, eyeliner.

Holy fuckin' shit I have a lead on 6th row tix to @nineinchnails in Brooklyn in October!!!! If I pull this off I will be the BEST MOTHER EVER!!!!
Much love for @nineinchnails . Not the Actual Events + Add Violence + Bad Witch was a rewarding first listen from start to finish.
In a @nineinchnails and How to Destroy Angels mood - very few people in the office today so blasting the music in my office

It's time for @nineinchnails #YearZero and, in particular, this killer track. https:// youtu.be/qSsRt_1l740
Unsurprisingly, it would be @nineinchnails without a doubt!
When you walk outside and hear a @nineinchnails song... but turns out to be a leaf blower, pressure washer, and someone knocking over tools in their garage. #disappointed
I just took a shit at work while listening to @nineinchnails 's Closer, and I suggest you do that too #WednesdayWisdom
