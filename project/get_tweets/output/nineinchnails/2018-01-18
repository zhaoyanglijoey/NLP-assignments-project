The @nineinchnails ARG for Year Zero has become sentient and we're all living in it. Seems reasonable.

Sitting in a hotel bedroom, watching @nineinchnails on the YouTube, done my #9albums and (as a bonus) #9films - Gotta say, pretty damn difficult. pic.twitter.com/vmZd8KPupA

. @nineinchnails Pureset Feeling is such a orgasmic blend of 80's New Wave and Industrial Metal. NIN would have been such a different band if Reznor continued on the path set forth by the album.
Yusssss!!! You'll need to tell me where to start with @nineinchnails ...
Had a blast hanging out with homie @slaterhogan jamming to classics ! @242FRONT242 @Nitzer_Ebb @nineinchnails tonight ! @TiniontheAve #CaliforniaKid #ArizonaKid Crazy how time flies.
We just finished the playlist for tomorrow's show. In addition to our Bay Area band of the week @museumsmusic , we are playing songs from @ilovelucius @Failure @glasser @_Warpaint @TheJudyCollins @nineinchnails and more! Thurs from 5-7PM at KPCA.fm. Thanks!
Stars - they're just like us! And that includes strange neighbors. @nineinchnails main man @trent_reznor has filed for a restraining order against his neighbor who's been behaving "irrationally and threateningly" towards him: http:// bit.ly/2rfwltJ [ | @BackBeatPhotog ] pic.twitter.com/h5VwXNWD36
The Defiant Ones on HBO. Unbelievable documentary of the heaviest hitters. Goodfellas reference, and The Mark Has Been Made by @nineinchnails in the first 1 minute.
