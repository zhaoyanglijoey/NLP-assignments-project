Would love to see a @B00TS + @nineinchnails collab. Someone make this a thing.

@nineinchnails are just one of those bands I go back and forth whether I love them or like them due to how weird and different some of their songs are.
May 2005 when I saw @nineinchnails at the Fillmore in Denver.
@nineinchnails the downward spiral

@nineinchnails at @ballstate sophomore year 1993 if i have the year correct
Who sings your favorite "Closer"? @Goapele , @KingsOfLeon , @NeYoCompound , @TheChainsmokers , or @nineinchnails ?!?!?!
@nineinchnails is the best workout music. Gets me pumped every time!
I stand by my opinion that #hurt by @nineinchnails is the superior version. Both are amazing, obviously, but they're simply about different pains. Depression is a bitch, and sometimes you just want to hurt.
I want 3 times the content of what I love...but if I had the power to demand @nineinchnails make more TDS and Perfect Drug type tracks in the late 90s, I wouldn't have had The Fragile. Such is life and learning appreciation.
Tripping out on @nineinchnails tonight. Such an amazing band!

Since I have a music career on the side, I plan on the whole soundtrack to be made with synthesizers and Darkwave/Industrial elements inspired by the likes of @nineinchnails and @MSI .
Put together this video to show off what my Noise @noiseimplant project is all about! For fans of @nineinchnails , Front 242, Haujobb, Frontline Assembly, etc. Check it!
