Yeah @nineinchnails is pretty rad I know.
Seeing @nineinchnails on the Wednesday Vegas show in June. Up in the balcony but I sooo don't care I will be in the room! As far as anyone knows the only North American dates this year so feeling privileged. 4-trip Vegas year for me this year.
Desperately seeking 3+ tickets to @nineinchnails Berlin show July 2, 2018. If u have any plz lemme know! #HopingAgainstHope @trent_reznor @robinfinck @rob_sheridan @mariqueen
Look at this, @RonJichardson : 86%. Eightysix percent! I'm safely home and watching Coronation Street... so I can delete it. Then I'm listening to some @nineinchnails . (Nice interval selection, by the way.) Cheers! pic.twitter.com/yBmgH8nN7b

@nineinchnails @trent_reznor Any chance the upcoming shows can be open taping or individual permission can be granted?

A bit of @nineinchnails on @johnkellytweets sure why not. Love tuning in on my way home from work. JK you are a gem!
Watching a documentary about @interscopejimmy @drdre on @NetflixUK and my face appears just as @nineinchnails starts playing. The gig was 1991 King tuts in Glasgow. I was 17. pic.twitter.com/dOl7xqN7CV
Loving hearing some @nineinchnails in @TheWalkingDead
Somebody please put a freeze on my credit card before I need to purchase @nineinchnails tickets! Somebody?! Anybody!!
@axs never received a presale code for the @nineinchnails show in June. I do have an account. How do I get the presale code? pic.twitter.com/uzGs2eT0T3
aaaaaaaaaand in june i'm seeing @nineinchnails in vegas!
Got tickets for both nights to see @nineinchnails in Vegas. Now we just wait for @COLDWAVES_ to say "hold my beer" and swoop in with their lineups. #soon
Seriously... how is StubHub legal? Pre-sale tickets for @nineinchnails sold out minutes ago and there are already dozens of tickets on StubHub for 2-3X the price. So annoying.
In 3 waiting rooms for @nineinchnails vegas show @HardRockHotelLV @TheJointLV and I'm dying!! Refresh! Refresh!
Upon further review the Johnny Cash version of Hurt, while amazing, is not, in fact superior to the @nineinchnails original.
