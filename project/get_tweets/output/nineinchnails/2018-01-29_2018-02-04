AL AIRE: 2x1 de @nineinchnails
Sometimes wonder how artists like @kendricklamar or @Eminem changed their minds and decided to go accept their grammys, while artists like @nineinchnails or @Tool stuck with their guns and never picked theirs up. Money, or something else at play?
If anyone needs me, I'll be in a @nineinchnails rabbit hole.

A select few. "Last Ninja II" for the C64 by @mattgrayc64 . Recently re-recorded with modern instruments. But the original still rocks. "Rise of the Triad" by @leejacksonaudio . "Quake" by @nineinchnails and "Quake II" by @sonicmayhem -- two very different kick-ass OSTs.

@nineinchnails it's years ago, pretty hate machine came out, I take a pretty surfer to see the crow and somehow I come up with the idea for jonny cash. You hear the voice of inspiration that day you called. I heard that years before you...perhaps im one of the team.

@nineinchnails
YouTube just recommended @nineinchnails 's closer as a vid. Well played YouTube. Well played.
I am convinced from seeing multiple videos of live performances by @nineinchnails that @trent_reznor hate's microphones.
