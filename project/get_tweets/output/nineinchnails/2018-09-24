Man! @nineinchnails played their jungle based song The Perfect Drug live for the first time ever last week. It sounds amazing in the videos but just watching the poor drummer made me want to go buy some advil and icy hot.
About to head to @TheOrpheumTN to see @maniacmeat (Tobacco) open for @TheMaryChain (Jesus & Mary Chain) open for @nineinchnails (NIN). I am stoked for this show, guys. I'll be sitting 3rd row.
