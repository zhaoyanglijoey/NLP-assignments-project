@nineinchnails here's what ppl put together
Oh wow! NIN + The Jesus and Mary Chain. That's a show! @trent_reznor I hope you are coming to the New Orleans, bro! And now I go to look bc I don't expect a response lol @nineinchnails
Music has helped me get through so many hard times in life, I realize for an artist to put out this music that they must have gone through hard times themselves. Much respect to @AvrilLavigne @Pink @linkinpark @nineinchnails @SeetherOfficial @Shinedown Sincerely Thank You
16 Year Old Kris "AHHHHH!" 32 Year Old Kris "I know, man. But guess what. We get to see @nineinchnails tonight." 16 Kris "Yeah?" 32 Kris "Yeah. I have $20 for beer." 16 Kris "How much beer does that get us?" 32 Kris "Like one and a half beers." 16 Kris "I can live with that." pic.twitter.com/mX90J8vcd9
