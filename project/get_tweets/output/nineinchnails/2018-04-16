After months, the lock is finally off. I had the INCREDIBLE opportunity to get to know @marteeeen ( @pilofficial , @nineinchnails , Pigface, etc, etc) This is the story underneath the music--of Martin Atkins the wonderful person--and I'm honored to share. http:// kcschreiber.com/martinstory pic.twitter.com/axRLoh41qV
#musicalinspirationmonday I met my good friend @3hole_puncher #JUS 20+ years ago and he taught me the dark arts of used CD store shopping on #queenstreet in #Toronto #the6ix and I discovered @nineinchnails @trent_reznor #prettyhatemachine pic.twitter.com/9H6FUGnZti
