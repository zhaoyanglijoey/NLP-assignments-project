Can we just have that @nineinchnails Year Zero show instead? Please?
Year Zero by @trent_reznor and @nineinchnails was on the nose when it came out, but now it's frighteningly prophetic.
I don't mind if Jeff Sessions is a @Nineinchnails fan, but I would prefer that Year Zero remains a work of fiction. pic.twitter.com/VUG77VIhFT

Trent Reznor of @nineinchnails talked about a very bad flight that scared him. http:// bit.ly/2Kiuf05
Always thought @nineinchnails would do a great version of this.
The money is IP and intangibles can be counted as revenue and untaxed net income. At least it looks good on paper converting equity into cash is more difficult boils down to selling or the checking account equity act of 1980 and NOW accounts. @nineinchnails

Not upset at all, it's just that, out of context, it feels a bit angsty. Just the downside to being a @nineinchnails fan in my late 30's.

The last time I saw @nineinchnails live was during the original Lollapalooza tour in 1991. I've watched nearly all major live videos on YouTube since, and I think I need to get to an Atticus Ross-supported show soon.
My October so far: - 5 days in the Poconos for #techbash - 4 days in North Carolina for work offisite - my 40th birthday - @nineinchnails concert - Halloween I'd really love to find my way to @creamcitycode , but pretty sure I'll be at max-people-exposure levels already.
That's so funny, I was just listening to @nineinchnails Hurt off The Downward Spiral for the first time in years, and I was thinking 'God Damn, this holds up!' I was getting all angsty like the good old days.

That's not better than @nineinchnails original.
How can even say that, what exactly makes old racist Johnny cash better then @nineinchnails who have been impacting inspiring and saving generations of youth with deep lyrics and beautifully thick layers and textures of sound as well as being years ahead of all OUR favs live
With apologies to @nineinchnails (love you guys) but Johnny Cash's cover of 'Hurt' is everything. https:// youtu.be/FywSzjRq0e4

How can I listen to heavy metal and BTS? Both take me on emotional journeys-happy sad depressed excited, lonely. Sometimes making me open that Pandora's box of dark emotions I try to bury. Thank you for making me face my demons @BTS_twt @nineinchnails @TheOfficialA7X

The first time I heard @nineinchnails , it cracked me open. Relief, pain, and recognition. While a lot of people don't rate Linkin Park, the video for Numb did the same. Seeing a girl with scars on screen, not graphic or glorified but just there, was meaningful.
