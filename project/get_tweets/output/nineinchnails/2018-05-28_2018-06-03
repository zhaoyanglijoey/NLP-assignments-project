Hoy anunciaron que viene @nineinchnails al @CoronaCapital y @DarkFuneral al @mexicometalfest . Por eso hoy y siempre: HAIL SATAN. pic.twitter.com/Fa3BYDBAw8
Dicen los amigos del @CoronaCapital que antes de irte a Europa a pasar el verano, deposites en tu taquilla favorita lo correspondiente al costo de tu boleto y tus 10 amigos que quieren ver a @dcfc @Manics @nineinchnails @Kattiatv @ivantrv @monteslalo pic.twitter.com/8qoTVIJXU6
@TheWarOnDrugs @dcfc @ChemBros @whoisMGMT @nineinchnails con eso basta mi querido Edman!
Que traigan a @nineinchnails en solicitarlo
Esos que dicen que no es emocionante ver a @nineinchnails en el @CoronaCapital son los mismos que piensan que el Black Album de @Metallica es un buen disco..?

Hey, @power97wpg , I love hearing Closer by @nineinchnails on the radio, but they have a TON of other great singles that you should also play.
I live the @nineinchnails song the use in the film.

If anyone wishes to musically reminisce about pre-GDPR privacy policies of large companies, I have found that the fantastic "The Collector" by @nineinchnails to be MOST appropriate... Pay careful attention to all of the the lyrics, Facebook comes to mind at times...
@nineinchnails why no Florida dates for 2018 tour?

Darn it! Missed orbital but just joined in time for @nineinchnails
@nineinchnails @trent_reznor The fan needs to be re-opened. Even if it came at a yearly/monthly fee it would be awesome!
First show of tour was awesome last night. Having a good off day today, found a @nineinchnails hat at a thrift store and about to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey in 70mm. https:// ift.tt/2J5O27m pic.twitter.com/TbTgcpo7CZ

Create some really dark atmosphere at work by putting on @nineinchnails #Still BUT I am the only one at the counter right now so it's not a selfish act.
Listening to @nineinchnails "Capital G" for the first time in ages and realizing all that's changed is it should be "Capital D"

Paid $90 for 2 lawn tickets at the booth in Nashville. Same tickets on-line increase to $127 after fees. No wonder why @nineinchnails wanted to circumvent those voltures.

That very heavily edited @nineinchnails Closer cover on #BGTfinal #BGT2018 #BritainsGotTalent tho. Must bring it down to about 27 seconds of lyrics
@nineinchnails errrr.....closer has just been played on the #BGTfinal2018
@nineinchnails closer being used for the Magic Mike musical on Britian's Got Talent is not good, what an insult to a brilliant song
Weird hearing Closer by @nineinchnails on Britain's got talent, even if it is heavily censored/chopped up to avoid all the naughty bits.
@BGT with a @nineinchnails soundtrack @magicmikemovie
Never thought i would hear @nineinchnails being played on #BGTFinal
DYING at hearing Nine Inch Nails on the #BGT final @nineinchnails
She kneeds to collaborate with @nineinchnails
