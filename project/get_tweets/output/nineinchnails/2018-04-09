I could have easily just picked every @Metallica , @nineinchnails , or @OzzyOsbourne album and made it easy for a Top 10 countdown. Not a bad album from any of those guys. I know plenty disagree.
I know I'm about 19 years late but "The Fragile" by @nineinchnails is an absolute masterpiece.
Me & my fav manager love @nineinchnails and jam to them quite often pic.twitter.com/jYrHhLXV5B
