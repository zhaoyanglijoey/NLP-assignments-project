Listening to 'The Flaw You Worship' by @SaulWilliams . I discovered Saul like 13 (?) years ago when he opened for @nineinchnails but hadn't listened to anything since 'List Of Demands'. Enjoying this a lot so far!
From last week's announcement, INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT: Legendary store & label Wax Trax! Records expands from its humble Denver beginnings, bringing up bands like @nineinchnails and @WeAreMinistry . #calgaryfilm http:// bit.ly/2M8MOG5 pic.twitter.com/WAtcoPev8G

@TalkIsJericho last weeks podcasts killed it. @TheGarden has always been great. Saw @NYRangers @nyknicks @nineinchnails @Aerosmith and more as a teen. As well as @SummerSlam where macho and Liz got married. Wish it was not so far out priced so I could bring my kids! 1/2

Nope. @nineinchnails , dipshit. That's some free speech for ya. See it's defamation free.
Yes definitely! But wouldn't he be too obvious to be the killer? Has there ever been a show with more oppressive awkward family vibes? Also: the last two episodes both had @nineinchnails songs for titles.

I bought the Quake 1 CD specifically because of @nineinchnails .
Worse still, @nineinchnails did all the sounds for Quake 1. Kids today will not who there are or how cool they still are. And Quake 1 will always be my favourite game....

I got a PhD out of spite toward the members of my dissertation committee that relished making my life a living hell... to the point of me wanting to die almost every minute of every day. With @nineinchnails lyrics, a little grit, and seething hate toward my abusers, I graduated.
