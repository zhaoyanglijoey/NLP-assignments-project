#MojoMiniReview @nineinchnails -Bad Witch: I really dig this album sonicly. The music, instrumentation, atmosphere is cool. Gonna have to pay more attention to the lyrics to see how this stacks up. @trent_reznor #NewMusicFriday #Rock #industrial #NIN #music #review #opinion pic.twitter.com/isD8G9o6aO

I've only really heard that one @nineinchnails song from 1989. Picked up tickets for my partner (a certified fan) to see them at @southbankcentre and was so glad I did. Colour me converted... pic.twitter.com/cusPCFBZHu
The new @nineinchnails album is Bowie, Miles Davis, Radiohead, Beck, Black Sabbath, and Smash Mouth all tossed into a dirty, broken blender and I love it.
Well I fucking loved that, @nineinchnails , thank you. #MeltdownFest
