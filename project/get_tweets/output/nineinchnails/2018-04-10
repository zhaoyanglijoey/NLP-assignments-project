Bashiok and Zarhym a few years ago were all over my suggestion of having @nineinchnails at a #BlizzCon . Maybe some year.
@nineinchnails @trent_reznor Any chance the upcoming shows can be open taping or individual permission can be granted?
We were delighted when London alt-rockers @TheNightSuns asked us to #premiere their video for "Human", if you're a fan of @qotsa @nineinchnails or @Nirvana this will be right up your street! http:// bit.ly/2qbGip3 #exclusive pic.twitter.com/8QLqGh6HJZ

@BusFactor1 We're about to play THE HAND THAT FEEDS by @NINEINCHNAILS ! Listen & Vote 4 More: http:// ftur.io/6LN9J2
Fair. This is the first festival I've been tempted by in 16 years. @Manics next to @deftones , @nineinchnails and @65dos by itself would be valid reason to take my firstborn
The music video for "We're in This Together" by @nineinchnails was influenced by this #film - http:// x.co/3dcCy pic.twitter.com/1kyEke2izS
I'm the type of guy that uses the song "Closer" by @nineinchnails as his @Tinder theme.
Dear @Mybshwll I saw your last show so how come your playing a London show that clashes with @nineinchnails ...
My personal top 3 bands would have included either @nineinchnails or #Tool , @PearlJam and @gunsnroses @fbhw @freebeergregg @FBHWJustin @hotwingsfbhw @NoPHinSteven

If money was no object I would be buying so many tickets for meltdown. But I have to make a choice so I've settled for @thetwilightsad and @FRabbits . Already have @nineinchnails @pfurs and @OfficialMBV
Wonder if @nineinchnails ever cut those long nails. How do you play a guitar with those things!! How impractical.
When Robert Smith schedules his show at the same time as @nineinchnails at RAH... @southbankcentre #meltdownfestival #firstworldgothproblems
Same time as @nineinchnails at the @RoyalAlbertHall - OUCH!! pic.twitter.com/1s0hXO1ZKw
In weniger als drei Monaten werde ich @nineinchnails live sehen. Hell to the yes! pic.twitter.com/FElL4ec8hX
Disappointed by @nineinchnails
NIN @nineinchnails @trent_reznor
