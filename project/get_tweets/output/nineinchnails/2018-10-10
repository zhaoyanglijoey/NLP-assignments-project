Great show last night. Really enjoyed your set. Went for @nineinchnails and walked away a fan of @KiteBaseMusic
Been excited for this show for so long!! LOVE @nineinchnails so much (The Jesus & Mary Chain are an added bonus!) Just wish my late brother Harold who made me a NIN fan was here to see them w/me too but he will be rocking out w/me in spirit @camkin @TigerLily1276 #NINONTOUR pic.twitter.com/YHYepID2pO
