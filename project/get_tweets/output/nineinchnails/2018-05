@nineinchnails admire what you're doing with ticketing it's different, what's in place to stop those tickets at the box office being resold? Guess it could make the situation worse, many touts make their income reselling and don't have jobs so can spend all day at the box office?

"God Break Down the Door" is a wild, unexpected ride of a @nineinchnails single. The @DavidBowieReal influence is all over it. Is it NIN or Donny McCaslin Group? Appropriately, this is most sax Trent has been playing on a NIN song since he played Subterraneans live with Bowie.

Hey @nineinchnails let's do some basic math.... @radiocity had 8 ticket windows, with each transaction taking 5 mins - so max 100 people an hour. This was all just a photo op for you at the expense of the #fans , wasn't it! #FuckYouTrent
I am guessing that Mr. Crown is no fan of @nineinchnails either.
The NIN Physical World presale was a huge success -- we got tix to both Phoenix shows -AND- my 13-yr old ultra-cool daughter got the experience of buying tix at a box office - which may never happen again! Thx @nineinchnails @trent_reznor @ComericaTheatre #ninpresale #NINontour
@TheAnthemDC @nineinchnails We came, we saw, and we rode the line ride. We made new friends, heard new tracks, and discovered new levels of soaking wet. 15 hours later we got home with tix! Good job on a well organized event! pic.twitter.com/7zh9fiVjnX
Hope everyone got the @nineinchnails tickets they desired today at the physical onsale events! I'm stoked and can't wait for the shows in the middle of next month, here in #Vegas at @TheJointLV !! #tds #downwardspiral #mrselfdestruct pic.twitter.com/ky1XMphUby
8(ish) hours in. Finally got to the photo op next up, @nineinchnails tickets. #NINONTOUR pic.twitter.com/fsFM6dO2CJ
@trent_reznor @nineinchnails Never done it this way before in my life. Made new friends, had an AWESOME Irving staff, celebrated NIN, and got the COOLEST merch to boot. THANK YOU TRENT FOR THE MUSIC & EXPERIENCE!! #NINONTOUR TX pic.twitter.com/0dDeOARTw6
Bout to be alll in that @nineinchnails pit #DownInIt
I spent 4 hours in the Memphis heat to get @nineinchnails tickets, but I got orchestra seats! See you crazy peeps from the line at the show! #NINONTOUR pic.twitter.com/13GXNxHdYF
It wasn't fun waiting 4hrs in the rain (& then leaving empty-handed to catch my train outta town) but my friend stuck it out & 6hrs later we have @nineinchnails tickets to @RadioCity . #NYC #NINonTour #NIN #oldschool
Got our NIN tickets after 8 hours in line! It was grueling and awesome at the same time. Met some fun people too. There, @nineinchnails are ya happy?

For as crazy as this morning was, and for as bummed as I am that tickets were literally twice cost I expected...I had a great time. Count on @nineinchnails to print a patch labeled 'Anxiety', and then ask us to meet all the other weirdos who wear it. In person. Good times.
My day of actual personal interaction with other fans was a blast tyvm Trent btw waiting for tix fo @nineinchnails at the Gon reminiscing many stories of alley line waits of past shows there @101WKQX c ya there kids pic.twitter.com/h9OBsOzMiD
@trent_reznor @LTLFest so excited for LTL this year!!!!! I have never seen @nineinchnails LIVE!!! pic.twitter.com/r6w1Dcpeyu
@nineinchnails HI, Im film director from Prague. With NiN I live my whole life. Already a long time I am trying to contact @trent_reznor but not successful. I want to shoot music video for NIN. If you want, here is my showreel from 2k16 https:// vimeo.com/210170660
@nineinchnails I want to thank you for the Physical World. Because of it AND you I got to meet an awesome old head and a cool kid. I also got 2nd row center stage at the price point YOU chose and not the 500% mark up a scalper would've chosen for me. Love you. See you Sept 14th
Idk why, but the "cold and black and infinite with nothing left to lose" line from Branches/Bones by @nineinchnails has always resonated with me since the moment I heard the song. Not really near the top of my fave NIN tracks, but that might be a lyric i get a tattoo of one day

TUESDAY: Tickets to see @nineinchnails , 4th row tickets to see + passes to meet @FitzAndTantrums & @XAmbassadors , and @IncubusBand tix! https:// youtu.be/xuE-wcgjjm8
I've called The Anthem more than twice about @nineinchnails tix. Apparently they've added a second show in October, which brings me so much joy. But when oh when I can purchase tix! Ah!
Huge thanks to @TheFoxTheatre and @NINONTOUR !!! looking forward to seeing @nineinchnails !!! #ninontour

@nineinchnails A Warm Place .. so nuanced. 3 bands of perfection: pluck, roiling bass/sub, and the dist-Hammond. Point of reference exemplified ..
my boyfriend said he's taking me to the @nineinchnails concert and I'm still not sure if he's legit being serious.
Hey all you @nineinchnails fans who bought tickets last Sunday at @1079kbpi pre sale! We all got screwed! No convince fees charged now in person for tickets! @axs doesn't care about customers! Sell your tix!

Exceptions that prove the rule: Panic! at the Disco, Florence + The Machine, @nineinchnails , Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Cure, Electric Light Orchestra, Evanescence, Motorhead, The Revolution, and Santana.
great song, Wondering if would ever do, an album, of stripped songs, or bare. Like @nineinchnails did with the Still Album?

@TheWarOnDrugs @dcfc @ChemBros @whoisMGMT @nineinchnails con eso basta mi querido Edman!
Que traigan a @nineinchnails en solicitarlo
Esos que dicen que no es emocionante ver a @nineinchnails en el @CoronaCapital son los mismos que piensan que el Black Album de @Metallica es un buen disco..?

If anyone wishes to musically reminisce about pre-GDPR privacy policies of large companies, I have found that the fantastic "The Collector" by @nineinchnails to be MOST appropriate... Pay careful attention to all of the the lyrics, Facebook comes to mind at times...
@nineinchnails why no Florida dates for 2018 tour?
