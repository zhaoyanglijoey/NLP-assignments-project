Holy shit, I'm going to see @nineinchnails tomorrow So excited.
@nineinchnails I am attending this Wednesday's show. Security stopped me last time (HDTA in MD) after Atticus yelled for me. Would love nothing more than to meet you and sign my son's birth certificate. Please let me know if this could be possible. This is my son, Reznor Evans pic.twitter.com/zDY5rR9MC3
So ready to see @nineinchnails in DC tomorrow!
If anyone needs a ticket for @nineinchnails at the Anthem tomorrow, @GenePark has one he needs to sell.
Con ver los sets completos de @PanicAtTheDisco y @nineinchnails , soy feliz
Y ya el domingo pues sacrificamos el final de @whoisMGMT y el inicio de @neworder por ver a @nineinchnails completo, a la mejor y llego al final de @Imaginedragons , pero al menos igual veo el set completo de @TheNeighborhood
@trent_reznor @nineinchnails Year Zero seems even more relevant these days than when it was released. Wasn't it supposed to be a multi-part concept? #ArtIsResistance
