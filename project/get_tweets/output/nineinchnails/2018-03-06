Almost all my fave bands are coming this summer @prophetsofrage @RobZombie @marilynmanson if only @nineinchnails would announce I would be complete!!
Down in it. @nineinchnails
Continuing the industrial vibe, it's @nineinchnails with Heresy. One of my favourite tracks from The Downward Spiral and was lucky to hear it played live when I saw them in Australia in 07 https:// youtu.be/Uvz-fYbFN_o #TOTD 135/176
What was billed as @nineinchnails final concert, at the @wiltern in '09. Went nearly four hours and was the living embodiment of an on stage catharsis for Trent.
@nineinchnails @pfurs might even try for @libertines just @SiouxsieHQ with Robert on guitar!
So @nineinchnails announced a London gig and I am in a constant state of AAAAAHHH

One London date only for @nineinchnails ?? Can't say I'm surprised but I am a bit disappointed considering they did an arena tour last time round. I will be trying like crazy to get tix though. Can't miss seeing them live.

I'm imagining taking photos for that @nineinchnails London show, and I've come to conclusion that I think i would be crying all over my camera the whole time
@nineinchnails @southbankcentre 'Although Royal Festival Hall is a seated venue, you are encouraged to stand at this gig.' Hoping there will still be tickets left after the #members get their pick! #nin
Holy shit! @nineinchnails at Royal Festival Hall as part of @meltdownfest is HUGE!!! Good luck getting tickets to that!
