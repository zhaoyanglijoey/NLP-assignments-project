Is @nineinchnails describing: A. Two or more nails that are nine inches long? OR B. Exactly nine nails that are one inch long? Discuss.

I noticed a street lamp pole ad for @nineinchnails was displayed shortly in the @hallmarkchannel movie #PumpkinPieWars
Happy 10th to this amazing concept album: @nineinchnails #GhostsIIV I owe so much to this release - the approach, the accompanying art and the arrangements of riffs. Highly underrated and the beginnings of the soundtrack love affair for both me & Mr. Reznor, my spirit animal pic.twitter.com/8DFptXSU1F

What was billed as @nineinchnails final concert, at the @wiltern in '09. Went nearly four hours and was the living embodiment of an on stage catharsis for Trent.

When your 3.5 year old keeps singing "I-I-I-I-I wanna watch you go down, I wanna watch you go down" and there's something strangely familiar about it, then you realize it's @nineinchnails (and you wonder what other lyrics she's been paying attention to). #MyKidIsABadass

I'm so fucking salty that I didn't get @nineinchnails tickets for London. Fucking scalpers didn't help the situation.
@southbankcentre #meltdown2018 come on. This is the worse system since the rugby World Cup. Wait in a vitus queue for 30 mins plus 2 hrs yesterday and sold out @nineinchnails only uk show. Not good enough.
The @nineinchnails fan presale tickets are now sold out. Southbank says there will be more available in the general sale tomorrow. All other shows, except My Bloody Valentine, still have tickets available for members.
Trying to get @nineinchnails tickets for their next London show has been a pain in the arse. Still nothing. 3rd day in a row tomorrow for general sale it is then
Well, that was a tense half an hour but I now have tickets for my favourites @nineinchnails in June!!!! Woooooooooooooooo hoooooooooooooo! #wellexcited
Any UK @nineinchnails fans got their London ticket? That was not the smoothest system!
So the @nineinchnails London pre-sale started at 10, I got on the site and it said I had to wait for an hour in a queue, and then at 10.19 it updated to say the pre-sale was sold out.... FFS!!!!!
@southbankcentre After 1h 45mins waiting for @nineinchnails tickets yesterday, to no avail. 10 mins on the fan presale today and I'll be there in June! #Excited
@nineinchnails pre-sale at @southbankcentre is slooooooooooooow - better not all be fucking bots buying up for secondary market or I will go postal. C'mon little man walk walk walk across that screen...
Got my ticket for @nineinchnails at the @southbankcentre this June! Pre sales are always terrifying
@southbankcentre much better today guys! Well done. Got my @nineinchnails tickets and gonna be ten rows back from @trent_reznor #AMAZING #MELTDOWN

In 3 waiting rooms for @nineinchnails vegas show @HardRockHotelLV @TheJointLV and I'm dying!! Refresh! Refresh!
Upon further review the Johnny Cash version of Hurt, while amazing, is not, in fact superior to the @nineinchnails original.

@trent_reznor @nineinchnails God. Damn. No matter how old it gets The Downward Spiral will always be way ahead of anything past, present or future. In my opinion, not that it means much, but... one of the top 10 albums ever made, any genre, period. Thank you for giving it to us!
