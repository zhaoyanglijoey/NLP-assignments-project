@trent_reznor @nineinchnails saw you guys in Nashville. So worth standing in line for 8 hours to buy tickets. One of the best shows I have ever been to, hands down. Every single one of you gave it your all. Best environment I've ever been in at a show. pic.twitter.com/hwRqIJpR7Y

Trent Reznor aka Nine Inch Nails es el mejor artista de la decada del '90. Por la musica / arte escenica / innovacion / estilo de la epoca y como repercutio en el mundo. Y a nivel historico lo pongo entre los mejores 10, que tipo crack. @nineinchnails
