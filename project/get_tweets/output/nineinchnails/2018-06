@nineinchnails @trent_reznor The fan needs to be re-opened. Even if it came at a yearly/monthly fee it would be awesome!

@nineinchnails errrr.....closer has just been played on the #BGTfinal2018
@nineinchnails closer being used for the Magic Mike musical on Britian's Got Talent is not good, what an insult to a brilliant song
Weird hearing Closer by @nineinchnails on Britain's got talent, even if it is heavily censored/chopped up to avoid all the naughty bits.

Bad Witch by @nineinchnails is one 2018 masterpiece. It shows Trent going further to new places while playing one mean saxophone in a couple of tracks no less. This is one way to end a trilogy and on a awesome note so bravo Mr Reznor for this. :)

It's impressive that all six @nineinchnails Hollywood Paladium shows in December are sold out.
The whole "Bad Witch" album is fantastic. I'm hearing a lot of new genres and influences I don't normally hear in a @nineinchnails recording #CanYouDigIt #BadWitch
Bad Witch is a brilliant record in its own right; dark, abrasive & the homage to Bowie is such a big part of it, that the album might not even exist if he were still here. The perfect way for @nineinchnails to close this trilogy.
@nineinchnails and you expect me to be calm after that FUCKING MASTERPIECE?! OH MY GOD #BADWITCH
THREE TRACKS INTO @nineinchnails BAD WITCH AND IT'S ONE OF THEIR BEST PROJECTS YET SO FAR! I love experimental Reznor, he is a mad genius. Ahead of Ourselves is fucking great!!! Can't wait for the next three (although I've already heard GBDTD)

Just submitted my review of @nineinchnails ' Bad Witch for publication tomorrow. Managed to expound upon the virtues of Reznor and Ross' six track release for over 1,700 words, so you best get hype. Oh, and no, I didn't waste words on the is it an EP or an album furore...
Thanks @nineinchnails for properly shipping out the new LP. #vinyl lovers appreciate the extra love in the packaging. Nothing worse than a having your brand new record show up damaged. #vinylrecords #NIN pic.twitter.com/DKtEXC2O1u

The new @nineinchnails album is Bowie, Miles Davis, Radiohead, Beck, Black Sabbath, and Smash Mouth all tossed into a dirty, broken blender and I love it.

Wow. Had the best concert experience of my life in Amsterdam seeing @nineinchnails @trent_reznor for the first time. Never seen such a chill but alive crowd and I couldn't have asked for a better setlist. The bits of Trump talking nonsense in The Great Destroyer were just genius

The new @nineinchnails album is bloody excellent.
I just heard original "Dead Souls" track from them and it's great. @nineinchnails did a great cover as well for #TheCrow SDTK
Yes. The new @nineinchnails "Play The Goddamned Part" followed by "God Break Down the Door" is amazing for quieting babies.
Just the right food for thought I needed to reflect upon during my vacation. Love @nineinchnails . Perfect inspiration moving forward always. https:// youtu.be/KhMgLssi3VQ
