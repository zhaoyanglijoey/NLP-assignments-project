Imagine if @trent_reznor hadn't had his heart broken in the 80s. I don't believe his creativity would have been limited at all, but without all of that angst, would we have ended up with the upbeat @nineinchnails debut Pretty Great Machine? #AlternateAlternativeHistory

Been reading Iron Council by China Mieville. Watching Ghost In The Shell 2. For some reason they've given me the urge to listen to Zero Year by @nineinchnails . Think I'll do that while making dinner.

@IrontomBand is like a hybrid of @awolnation and @nineinchnails lite rolled into one. Saw them open for @ChiliPeppers last spring in 2017, they were mind blowing.
Nerd fact of the day: Between Laura Poitras's @Citizenfour , @LizGarbus 's THE FOURTH ESTATE & @KenBurns ' THE VIETNAM WAR, I now count at least three major docus that have used parts of @NineInchNails ' groundbreaking (& public domain) GHOSTS I-IV in their soundtracks. Any others?

Yes/no; @nineinchnails played a version of it as part of the set in Bangkok last week from which I posted a short clip.
I love every era of @nineinchnails
@nineinchnails ON!!!
This day began with Stabbing Westward announcing a fall tour and ends with new @bmthofficial . And in a month I get to see @nineinchnails again.

Wow! Great song choice too since it's about suicide and regrets. Preferred the original of "Hurt" by @nineinchnails or even Johnny Cash's cover. But beautiful anyway.

Gracias @rtve2 por dejaros el final de @nineinchnails sin grabar, ya me pongo Hurt en casa.
Been listening to @nineinchnails stuff today. Not bad stuff. Can anyone suggest to me which pressings to listen to, because I can't really find a lot of threads on which pressings are best. I only found one thread which was on Downward Spiral.
@nineinchnails AHORA DIRECTO @la2_tve
. @la2_tve retransmitiendo el concierto de @nineinchnails en Mad Cool. Yo lo llamo un cierre perecto de semana.
I was going to stream a bit tonight but then a Spanish channel decided to play the full @nineinchnails concert at @madcoolfestival and I really really need to live that moment again. #nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/PG5estU7bT
Hace un mes y medio en el @madcoolfestival , ahora en @la2_tve . Enormes @nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/gH5h3JGWTC
@nineinchnails ahora en @la2_tve . Es curioso ver a uno de mis grupos favoritos, presente en BSOs de pelis, series y videojuegos, pero al que casi nadie conoce.
The piano bars in @nineinchnails The Frail are some of the most haunting music, gets me every time, I'll be listening to that track till my dying breath...
