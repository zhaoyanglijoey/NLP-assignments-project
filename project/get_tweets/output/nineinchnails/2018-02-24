I you @nineinchnails
Hey @trent_reznor , is it weird to be a @nineinchnails AND a @PhilCollinsFeed fan?
I'm rioting anyway!!! @joanjett is blasting at the moment. @nineinchnails playlist is ready...

Their song reminded me of the magnificent @nineinchnails - wonder if they have influenced him like he must surely have influenced them?
I think I just cracked a @nineinchnails production code. Those last 7min of The Background World, where clips keep getting re-fed through analog gear to build up distortion, are all stacked up and then quickly crossfaded through during the last minute or so of the actual song!
@lostinvegas83 Guys! Thanks to some fellow bastards in a @primus FB group I happened upon you two. My wife and I have been hooked since then. W/ that said gotta throw my cpl bands missing from your reactions for ur consideration @nineinchnails , @dillingerescpln , @WeAreMinistry .
I had pandora on & it had been pretty quiet. I opened a cnn article and the video started playing automatically (annoying). Right as #Rubio begins to speak the opening riff of #reptile by @nineinchnails overwhelms his words it it looks like it is coming out of his mouth.

If there's one thing I want to happen before I die, it's a cover of Styx's Mr. Roboto by @nineinchnails
One of my favorite things to do is to rediscover old music albums that I have not heard in years. Today it was Pretty Hate Machine by @nineinchnails by far one of the best albums ever made. #music #masterpiece
Looks like something taken from a @nineinchnails show
You can have my isolation You can have the hate that it brings You can have my absence of faith You can have my everything @nineinchnails @r101ck http:// Rock101online.mx pic.twitter.com/Cmh0J5LIem
#FavoriteLyrics : How could I ever think it's funny how? Everything you swore would never change, is different now Like you said, "You and me make it through" Didn't quite fell apart, where the fuck were you? - @nineinchnails #SomewhatDamaged #nineinchnails
Gotta love @nineinchnails
I'm listening to "Closer" by @nineinchnails on @pandora_radio . #pandora http:// pdora.co/2ALm6ws
