Just listening to @nineinchnails . It's pointless coz I don't feel anything.
I know that @Spotify has it's Kylo Ren Playlist full of metal, but I'd bet my best pod racer he's listens to @thecure and @depechemode probably @joydivision too. And way more @nineinchnails on the list. I think he has every single Halo hidden away with his calligraphy.
Mixed feelings when switching on @ARDde to see go-go dancers moving to @nineinchnails #closer in some cheap crime movie
I love how @madcoolfestival is perhaps my only chance ever to see @DUALIPA , @nineinchnails and @deafhavana in the same day. The line up is beyond incredible pic.twitter.com/PkQD7ReOaW

The Defiant Ones on @NetflixUK is hands down one of the best documentaries I have ever seen Amazing production and who knew @interscopejimmy was behind so much of the music I loved growing up.

@Spotify Gapless albums should automatically turn Shuffle mode off. A user setting could be used to control this behavior. For example @nineinchnails Ghosts I-IV.

I thought we'd do a rock song today from @nineinchnails titled "Hurt" off the album The Downward Spiral. This song is fantastic, starting out eery and mysterious, but ends with a subtle passionate roar. Fun fact, this song was actually covered by Johnny Cash in 2002. Enjoy pic.twitter.com/YV6lCAqbdt
. @nineinchnails "Closer" (Nick Evol Remix) out this Friday. Here's a quick sneak peek for your aural sensibilities. Get ready... pic.twitter.com/JlyZksCeRy

Falto @nineinchnails
I hear you, @CapRadioNews , playing "The Background World" by @nineinchnails in your station identification break from @pritheworld <3
Recently, Mr. Self Destruct, on The Downward Spiral, by @nineinchnails , has been melting my eardrums.
Am I really about to drive from Tucson to Vegas to see @nineinchnails alone because all my friends are fake as fuck?
We're pushing over an hour here. Boring chit chat about their culinary habits. They're dragging out convos. Nothing left to talk about but neither wants to leave just yet? Update. Her Spotify songs consist mostly of the band Nine Inch Nails @nineinchnails
Day 6 of 10 - 10 all-time favorite albums that made a big impact and are still on your rotation list, even if rarely. Post the cover, no need to explain and nominate a person each day to do the same. @trent_reznor @nineinchnails #nin pic.twitter.com/SUs79ZXZnR
well it's about time I'm going to see @nineinchnails in June. pic.twitter.com/DEpV5PeDLF
Yeah they were dead good. When I saw @gunsnroses previously @wembleystadium with @nineinchnails G n R put on an epic amazing show, maybe they were having an off day or begining to self destruct. But after Maine Road all their records and stuff went to the charity shop
Might have a spare ticket for @nineinchnails at @meltdownfest if the bestie can't make it (I'll still be going) - WATCH THIS SPACE

The new @UnderoathBand album is an incredible piece of art! It is nothing I expected and everything I never knew I wanted. The eerie synth vibe through out gives me the feels I had hearing @nineinchnails and early @deftones Bravo gentleman on this amazing record! pic.twitter.com/I5ckMP8tzg
My mom is like "if you wanna sell those festivls tickets my cousin likes these bands." Um no because the only people that could make carolina rebellion any better would be @marilynmanson or @nineinchnails

I miss the world that I lived in when @nineinchnails Year Zero was just an album and not a reality
We were delighted when London alt-rockers @TheNightSuns asked us to #premiere their video for "Human", if you're a fan of @qotsa @nineinchnails or @Nirvana this will be right up your street! http:// bit.ly/2qbGip3 #exclusive pic.twitter.com/HsixrJ0H0X
