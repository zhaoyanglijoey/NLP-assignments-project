The music media is focusing on the wrong damn story. Sure Reznor's post-Coachella almost plane crash is crazy but his New Orleans goth club hug from Robert Smith?? Pure. Gold. The world needs more #GothClubHugs @nineinchnails @thecure @theQuietus #SlackerRadio pic.twitter.com/LivnWwCc0j

Not upset at all, it's just that, out of context, it feels a bit angsty. Just the downside to being a @nineinchnails fan in my late 30's.

The last time I saw @nineinchnails live was during the original Lollapalooza tour in 1991. I've watched nearly all major live videos on YouTube since, and I think I need to get to an Atticus Ross-supported show soon.
My October so far: - 5 days in the Poconos for #techbash - 4 days in North Carolina for work offisite - my 40th birthday - @nineinchnails concert - Halloween I'd really love to find my way to @creamcitycode , but pretty sure I'll be at max-people-exposure levels already.
That's so funny, I was just listening to @nineinchnails Hurt off The Downward Spiral for the first time in years, and I was thinking 'God Damn, this holds up!' I was getting all angsty like the good old days.
