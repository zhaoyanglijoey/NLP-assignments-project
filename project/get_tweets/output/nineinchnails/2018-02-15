I followed @rob_sheridan originally because I was always blown away by his contributions to @nineinchnails . It's morphed into being blown away by his contributions in general to political debate. Thanks for using your platform so well man, it's appreciated.
@nineinchnails please look up KANGA. She is the Vanilla Ice to your Freddie and Bowie.
@nineinchnails , Baraka, Interstellar, & Dark Crystal make essay grading otherwordly.

it's almost "malovious" to see the proof absolutely everywhere, http:// en.reallyhim.com/MALOVIOUS.html #malarkey or #maladwhy from the @Xbox @Nintendo and Genesis to #Tennessee ; #see that X is ten and @nineinchnails aren't a #fluke ... the music is the message. .. http:// iowa.s.lamc.la
Just noticed the neighbors getting it started behind their house! So I played @nineinchnails #closer loud as hell from my yard to help set the mood for them! Kinda want to go over and knock on the door and ask if they got a little while to talk about something.
I just realized i wasnt following @nineinchnails on this account, i wonder who else i listen to that im not following on here
I'm tempted to record myself playing Last by @nineinchnails also how long can videos be on here, cause my Black Parade one is like 5 min
