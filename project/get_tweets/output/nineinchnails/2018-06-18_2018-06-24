@nineinchnails al atardecer......
Only 4 more days until my earholes are flooded with NEW @nineinchnails MUSIC!!! #MusicMonday pic.twitter.com/V7y4N5Lhn4
Not been the best few days, but situations are slowly resolving themselves AND I'm off to see @nineinchnails in London Friday AND Sunday. So "things" appear to be coming together (instead of "falling apart"*). *That's a subtle NIN in-joke too btw.
. @ElvisCostello is coming to PHOENIX!!!!!!! Also: Valley dates announced for @jason_mraz @Miguel @jackjohnson @KIDZBOP @nineinchnails @OfficialSting and @shaggy757 , @wizkhalifa w/ @RaeSremmurd , @nineinchnails @JimGaffigan , @xtina Read more at @azcentral https:// bit.ly/2E1r6iK

Bad Witch by @nineinchnails is one 2018 masterpiece. It shows Trent going further to new places while playing one mean saxophone in a couple of tracks no less. This is one way to end a trilogy and on a awesome note so bravo Mr Reznor for this. :)
Counting the days until Sunday, almost time for @nineinchnails at The Royal Albert Hall. I am so ready for this, as Trent has never failed to blow me away. #NIN pic.twitter.com/MBj9cIx1ie
So excited for @nineinchnails at the @RoyalAlbertHall , how often do people get to see favourite band at favourite music venue?
Thrashy punk rock indecisive chaosand insanity from within to swanky contemplative solitude and emotional closure... #whatatrip @nineinchnails #badwitch @trent_reznor #suckmyentire #ninontour
What if this whole crusade's A charade https:// youtu.be/xwhBRJStz7w @nineinchnails #NIN
If @bombfactorydfw wants to prevent scalping, instead of punishing the fans who desperately wanted to see @Slayer on their final tour, why not sell tickets solely at the box office like @nineinchnails did?! Over 30-40 ppl so far turned away. Absolutely ridiculous
"Shit Mirror" by @nineinchnails is the best chiptune song I've ever heard.

It's impressive that all six @nineinchnails Hollywood Paladium shows in December are sold out.
The whole "Bad Witch" album is fantastic. I'm hearing a lot of new genres and influences I don't normally hear in a @nineinchnails recording #CanYouDigIt #BadWitch
Bad Witch is a brilliant record in its own right; dark, abrasive & the homage to Bowie is such a big part of it, that the album might not even exist if he were still here. The perfect way for @nineinchnails to close this trilogy.
@nineinchnails and you expect me to be calm after that FUCKING MASTERPIECE?! OH MY GOD #BADWITCH
THREE TRACKS INTO @nineinchnails BAD WITCH AND IT'S ONE OF THEIR BEST PROJECTS YET SO FAR! I love experimental Reznor, he is a mad genius. Ahead of Ourselves is fucking great!!! Can't wait for the next three (although I've already heard GBDTD)

Just submitted my review of @nineinchnails ' Bad Witch for publication tomorrow. Managed to expound upon the virtues of Reznor and Ross' six track release for over 1,700 words, so you best get hype. Oh, and no, I didn't waste words on the is it an EP or an album furore...
Thanks @nineinchnails for properly shipping out the new LP. #vinyl lovers appreciate the extra love in the packaging. Nothing worse than a having your brand new record show up damaged. #vinylrecords #NIN pic.twitter.com/DKtEXC2O1u

The new @nineinchnails album is Bowie, Miles Davis, Radiohead, Beck, Black Sabbath, and Smash Mouth all tossed into a dirty, broken blender and I love it.
Well I fucking loved that, @nineinchnails , thank you. #MeltdownFest
