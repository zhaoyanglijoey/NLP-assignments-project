Type o negative @nineinchnails @DavidBowieReal and @prince
Apparently it was @TheMaryChain , Beulah, @corneliusjapan , @FRabbits , @JustinTEarle , and @nineinchnails . Assuming he meant the NIN...
I may be fortunate enough to go see @nineinchnails in London this summer

@southbankcentre , @nineinchnails @meltdownfest @RobertSmith Dear all, it would be really nice from you, if you could stop any secondary ticketing for the Meltdown, if not forever .. pic.twitter.com/WzWLUiCMot

@southbankcentre @nineinchnails Pre-sale tickets for Southbank members sold out this morning. Not surprised by @viagogo here, but am still appalled. How can we stop this happening? #TicketTouts #MeltdownFestival @meltdownfest pic.twitter.com/s2NlyMwu0L

@nineinchnails will there be a members presale for the Meltdown Festival?
chino moreno, maynard james keenan and trent reznor all have really nice voices and anyone can fight me on this. @chinomoreno @deftones @mjkeenan @puscifer @Tool @nineinchnails @trent_reznor
Stagger the queue? On the phone or the website or both? I am still fuming. I cannot go through this debacle tomorrow, all I wanted to do was see one band. . @nineinchnails
When your 3.5 year old keeps singing "I-I-I-I-I wanna watch you go down, I wanna watch you go down" and there's something strangely familiar about it, then you realize it's @nineinchnails (and you wonder what other lyrics she's been paying attention to). #MyKidIsABadass
ahhh can't wait! Will there be any @nineinchnails incorporated?
I hope @nineinchnails comes to Vancouver soon, I ripped my Lights in the Sky tour shirt today. With Teeth and Tension tour shirts still holding on strong.
This album is just over 25 years old and it still kicks my ass. @nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/G5Limi1djz
Prepare your butts for new @nineinchnails music tomorrow #fanboying #omg
It's just dawned on me that @deftones are playing Copenhell the same day as @nineinchnails are playing Southbank and I've never been so torn over shows.. CPH, Deftones and BMX.... Or NiN in London.
That's a @nineinchnails song
Ticket in the bag for @nineinchnails in London. Now to find a hotel, or somebody that does not mind a tall welshman sleep on their sofa. #nin #MeltdownFest
If you're one of the people trying to sell @nineinchnails / @trent_reznor tickets for the @meltdownfest on sites like #Viagogo for hugely inflated prices, you're basically scum. Wish the organisers would stop this happening and ensure tickets went to real fans. pic.twitter.com/5xdAIky8ja
I'd like to know what Trent Reznor ( @nineinchnails ) thinks of this...

@southbankcentre I hope you will be checking ID with tickets for @nineinchnails because the tix are all over resale sites like @viagogo pic.twitter.com/FQt0Zn2mMk
Well that's going to a mighty fine weekend... @nineinchnails on 22/6, @foofighters the following night. London won't know what's hit it.
Happy 24th Birthday to My Favorite Album: @nineinchnails - #TheDownwardSpiral . I've owned NO LESS than 15 copies of this album in various formats across these weird 24 years. Thank you again & forever. pic.twitter.com/kZ5azIKapB
tickets acquired.... Let's go June! #NIN #meltdown @nineinchnails @meltdownfest pic.twitter.com/HpaGCq4j5m
So, turned 40 last week. One of my presents, ticket to see @nineinchnails at @meltdownfest . Happy me. @trent_reznor
@MassiveAttackUK , @pinkfloyd , @nineinchnails Still Album, @PhilCollinsFeed , @radiohead @depechemode , Hallelujah, Hungry Eyes, I can Dream about you, @amygrant I will remember you, @eltonofficial , Lady in red, broken wings, @tiesto , @sineadoconnor nothing compare
Awwww yiss! Got tickets for @nineinchnails in London pic.twitter.com/fJyZyHSbZ3
Yes, got the @nineinchnails Meltdown tix
yeah. This madness. @southbankcentre should be cancelling these sales which are on offer for 10-20x face value and selling as returns. Should be punishing sellers not fans who buy them though @meltdownfest ! @nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/Nnup5n0gk6
Nine inch nails tickets for @meltdownfest at @southbankcentre in the bag!! @nineinchnails #MeltdownFest #NIN
I'm going to see @nineinchnails . Sorry @foofighters ... but it's Reznor
@nineinchnails How are these corporate ticket touts able to get tickets to sell at these prices before the fans can? pic.twitter.com/bzh6gPx4z9
O.M.G That was stressful! :) Not nearly as close to the action as i want to be, but i'm gonna enjoy it no matter what!! Thanks @nineinchnails and see you soon @trent_reznor I'm f'n stoked!! pic.twitter.com/KiRkAyzDou
I'm so fucking salty that I didn't get @nineinchnails tickets for London. Fucking scalpers didn't help the situation.
@southbankcentre #meltdown2018 come on. This is the worse system since the rugby World Cup. Wait in a vitus queue for 30 mins plus 2 hrs yesterday and sold out @nineinchnails only uk show. Not good enough.
The @nineinchnails fan presale tickets are now sold out. Southbank says there will be more available in the general sale tomorrow. All other shows, except My Bloody Valentine, still have tickets available for members.
Trying to get @nineinchnails tickets for their next London show has been a pain in the arse. Still nothing. 3rd day in a row tomorrow for general sale it is then
Well, that was a tense half an hour but I now have tickets for my favourites @nineinchnails in June!!!! Woooooooooooooooo hoooooooooooooo! #wellexcited
Any UK @nineinchnails fans got their London ticket? That was not the smoothest system!
So the @nineinchnails London pre-sale started at 10, I got on the site and it said I had to wait for an hour in a queue, and then at 10.19 it updated to say the pre-sale was sold out.... FFS!!!!!
@southbankcentre After 1h 45mins waiting for @nineinchnails tickets yesterday, to no avail. 10 mins on the fan presale today and I'll be there in June! #Excited
@nineinchnails pre-sale at @southbankcentre is slooooooooooooow - better not all be fucking bots buying up for secondary market or I will go postal. C'mon little man walk walk walk across that screen...
Got my ticket for @nineinchnails at the @southbankcentre this June! Pre sales are always terrifying
@southbankcentre much better today guys! Well done. Got my @nineinchnails tickets and gonna be ten rows back from @trent_reznor #AMAZING #MELTDOWN
Got @nineinchnails tickets laaaaaads!
Desperately need the @nineinchnails meltdown presale code! Tried for over 2 hours yesterday for ticket :(
A fridge full of musical nibbles for you today on @sohoradio >> @TheOfficialMBV @thebreeders @Youngfathers @lowtide_ @nakhaneofficial @nineinchnails @BJM_Band @nojoy @danielmarkavery @holymotors @LouReed @sarasara_music and more .. tune in live and turn me on
