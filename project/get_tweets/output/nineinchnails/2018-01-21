Racking my brain to decide on themes for the short film I'll be making for this EP. I'm really thinking a Broken Movie from @nineinchnails vine, just less gore and more dreamlike visuals. Blugh this is difficult lol.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: The cat's out the bag!!! We're made up to announce that Alan Moulder has been working with us to mix our debut album. He's worked with @NineInchNails , @FooFighters , @TheKillers , @Foals , @ArcticMonkeys , and @RoyalBloodUK so a real honour.
#MyClassicAlbum would probably have to by @nineinchnails - The Downward Spiral. (Closely followed by FuturePerfect by @VNV_Nation )
Husband is waking up in a couple of hours to do God's work @GreenvilleOaks by manning the video booth. I'm wiped out due to journalistic pipe dreams and @nineinchnails videos on @YouTube . Sweet dreams, friends. Sweet dreams are made of this, who am I to disagree? @BarrettBrown_
Head like a hole, black as your soul. I'd rather DIE than give you control. @nineinchnails @HeneryPress @Bouchercon @DFWCON @utdmercury @EFF @FreedomofPress @ACLUTx @ACLU #civilrights #1A #2A #4A #journalism @Tara_Mckelvey
@nineinchnails please come to Toronto this year
"Hurt" by @nineinchnails came on today and my 11-year-old son asked, "Didn't Johnny Cash do a version of this song?" That made me very proud.
pretty hate machine by @nineinchnails is prolly one of the darkest album's i've ever heard but it's also one of my favs so
Even after all these years @nineinchnails #prettyhatemachine holds up as one of my favorite albums.
Today's #wardrobe organizing #music #playlist : @FleetwoodMac , @JourneyOfficial , @JohnnyCash & friends, The Supremes, @Outkast , @CrayonPop , @NineInchNails #success #weekendvibes
