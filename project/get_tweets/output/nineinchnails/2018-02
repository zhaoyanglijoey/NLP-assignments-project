"Brain Damage" by @pinkfloyd is fingerpicking exercise song this quarter. Was quiet at school, so jammed in the waiting area instead of the practice rooms and got a small audience. Practiced creating some @nineinchnails style beats on @Ableton afterwards.

Who sings your favorite "Closer"? @Goapele , @KingsOfLeon , @NeYoCompound , @TheChainsmokers , or @nineinchnails ?!?!?!
@nineinchnails is the best workout music. Gets me pumped every time!
I stand by my opinion that #hurt by @nineinchnails is the superior version. Both are amazing, obviously, but they're simply about different pains. Depression is a bitch, and sometimes you just want to hurt.
I want 3 times the content of what I love...but if I had the power to demand @nineinchnails make more TDS and Perfect Drug type tracks in the late 90s, I wouldn't have had The Fragile. Such is life and learning appreciation.
Tripping out on @nineinchnails tonight. Such an amazing band!

Driving in Alberta is sooooo boring. So glad to have @nineinchnails for the long trip through this nothingness. pic.twitter.com/akzbKg2sil
. @Pablo_Francisco wearing a @nineinchnails patch on his jacket this morning on @WGNNews was reason alone to buy tix for his show tonight.
Two great tastes that taste great together, @numanofficial & @nineinchnails http:// ow.ly/iC5N30iy6tD

Which version do you like better? @nineinchnails or @JohnnyCash ? Great song!
Now listening: @nineinchnails With Teeth. Haven't listened to this album for quite a while and forgot what an absolute cracker of an album it is. Pretty much all killer no filler. #NIN #withteeth
@nineinchnails will we hear an update soon on the remaining vinyl releases? And do you think that Fixed or Ghosts will ever be repressed again? Thanks in advance!
I want Jackson Pollock to paint to @nineinchnails closer @nineinchnails_

The Hand That Feeds - @NineInchNails with Chris Vrenna (born February 23,1967): http:// ow.ly/o7nl30i2Q4H

#LamentoAvisarteQue there is no fucking you, there is only me @nineinchnails
Un poco de @nineinchnails esta noche. https:// youtu.be/JujihaeDpQ0
Calling @nineinchnails and @WeAreMinistry goth pisses music fans off like calling an AR-15 an Assault Rifle pisses of gun nuts and @nra shills.
I heard that awful woman from the N R A said she was a @nineinchnails fan, which is pretty funny because even if this song wasn't written about her it certainly could have been https:// youtu.be/nOVW938sr0k

I you @nineinchnails
Hey @trent_reznor , is it weird to be a @nineinchnails AND a @PhilCollinsFeed fan?
I'm rioting anyway!!! @joanjett is blasting at the moment. @nineinchnails playlist is ready...
Florida right now @nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/V2zDFpJdnI
Their song reminded me of the magnificent @nineinchnails - wonder if they have influenced him like he must surely have influenced them?
I think I just cracked a @nineinchnails production code. Those last 7min of The Background World, where clips keep getting re-fed through analog gear to build up distortion, are all stacked up and then quickly crossfaded through during the last minute or so of the actual song!
@lostinvegas83 Guys! Thanks to some fellow bastards in a @primus FB group I happened upon you two. My wife and I have been hooked since then. W/ that said gotta throw my cpl bands missing from your reactions for ur consideration @nineinchnails , @dillingerescpln , @WeAreMinistry .
I had pandora on & it had been pretty quiet. I opened a cnn article and the video started playing automatically (annoying). Right as #Rubio begins to speak the opening riff of #reptile by @nineinchnails overwhelms his words it it looks like it is coming out of his mouth.

If there's one thing I want to happen before I die, it's a cover of Styx's Mr. Roboto by @nineinchnails
One of my favorite things to do is to rediscover old music albums that I have not heard in years. Today it was Pretty Hate Machine by @nineinchnails by far one of the best albums ever made. #music #masterpiece
Looks like something taken from a @nineinchnails show
You can have my isolation You can have the hate that it brings You can have my absence of faith You can have my everything @nineinchnails @r101ck http:// Rock101online.mx pic.twitter.com/Cmh0J5LIem
#FavoriteLyrics : How could I ever think it's funny how? Everything you swore would never change, is different now Like you said, "You and me make it through" Didn't quite fell apart, where the fuck were you? - @nineinchnails #SomewhatDamaged #nineinchnails
Gotta love @nineinchnails
I'm listening to "Closer" by @nineinchnails on @pandora_radio . #pandora http:// pdora.co/2ALm6ws
The first thing I did with my now working laptop is blast @GreenDay , @AFI , @nineinchnails , and @NOFXband
They are punk rock fans, thex wouldn't go there. Fight me! They hold hands to @paramore music and fuck to @nineinchnails closer.

Maness' trio's song selections run the gamut from @Outkast to @radiohead to @nineinchnails , alongside more expected jazz standards. http:// ow.ly/Wdag30iFITi
[Instagram] THEN MY HEAD, FELL APART, AND WHERE WERE YOU? @nineinchnails 08/20/2013 London, Scala - Somewhat Damaged. I wish there was a full recording of this gig. The footage here is the epitome of why I love NIN live so much. Pure intensity. https:// instagram.com/p/BfvnhTGHBVa/ pic.twitter.com/ojHxkDyy6V

Na @Val202 so @nineinchnails .
godfuck I just realized we're actually closer to @nineinchnails ' vision of the world in #YearZero than the guys probably expected
@nineinchnails The Downward Spiral
Funnily enough @nineinchnails and a bunch of other 'dark' music genres and my goth phase. 25 years later and i still listen to it
1am KCMQ After Dark has: @OfficialITM @threedaysgrace @Disturbed @thebandGHOST @nineinchnails & more! #KCMQAD #TodaysRock - @beazlrock

@nineinchnails The Downward Spiral - Heresy, March of the Pigs, Closer.
The Downward Spiral by @nineinchnails is the greatest album of all time for me. No contest, no close second. Fuck, it's so good!
