@nineinchnails A Warm Place .. so nuanced. 3 bands of perfection: pluck, roiling bass/sub, and the dist-Hammond. Point of reference exemplified ..
my boyfriend said he's taking me to the @nineinchnails concert and I'm still not sure if he's legit being serious.
Hey all you @nineinchnails fans who bought tickets last Sunday at @1079kbpi pre sale! We all got screwed! No convince fees charged now in person for tickets! @axs doesn't care about customers! Sell your tix!
