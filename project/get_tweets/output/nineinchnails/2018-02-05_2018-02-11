I'm sure you've been asked this a million times, but any idea when the new album is to be released this year? - I'm excited to hear it, even though you say it's different from your previous releases... I'm always listening to new @nineinchnails , I'm not stuck in the 90s of them.

I remember when The Slip came out. We were in the process of recording our third album. The raw, creative, and explosive energy of #TheSlip pushed us to think even more outside the box musically. Inspiring to say the least. Thank you @nineinchnails @trent_reznor pic.twitter.com/hzjZYxIzIh

Rendering video and listening to Nine Inch Nails @nineinchnails
"Brain Damage" by @pinkfloyd is fingerpicking exercise song this quarter. Was quiet at school, so jammed in the waiting area instead of the practice rooms and got a small audience. Practiced creating some @nineinchnails style beats on @Ableton afterwards.
Got the pre-sale email to buy tix for @nineinchnails in Amsterdam. Seriously contemplated how much I would need to sell to make that trip happen.
This evenings vibes..... A bit of living room dancing to @nineinchnails
When @nineinchnails gives your auto focus a run for its money another fast paced strobe, darkness heavy gig. I think this might have been one of my first gigs at @pertharena as well! http:// ift.tt/2E71hye pic.twitter.com/hyzhqk4Qfw

@nineinchnails Hey guys this maybe out of the norm but I've been thinking a lot about what life experiences mean to us... Would you be able to send a bday shout out to ghost_passenger? Today is my guy's 30th bday, he would flip his sh* if he saw a tweet from his favorite bandThx!
Alright, Ghostheads -- this Kylie-rific panel needs a soundtrack. Something emo yet badass. I vote for @nineinchnails ! What say you? #Ghostbusters Annual 2018 coming Feb. 28 from @IDWPublishing @erikburnham @Dapperpomade pic.twitter.com/Ylyten8dam

If you think @nineinchnails make formulaic music, here's my example: Pretty Hate Machine (Synth-Pop/Industrial) Broken (Industrial-Metal) The Downward Spiral (Multi-Genre Industrial) The Fragile (Industrial-Rock) With Teeth (Industrial Alternative-Rock)...
