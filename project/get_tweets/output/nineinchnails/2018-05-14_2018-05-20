Hey @trent_reznor / @nineinchnails , I love the way you're doing tickets for the new tour but as an Ohioan, we would happily road trip to #Nashvegas to see yall, but we can't get tix before hand. That sucks for us but at the same time, fuck Ticketmaster. Can't wait for #HALO32 !

re-visited With Teeth by @nineinchnails for the first time in a good while this morning and now am angry at myself for not listening to it for so long. real great album.

@nineinchnails admire what you're doing with ticketing it's different, what's in place to stop those tickets at the box office being resold? Guess it could make the situation worse, many touts make their income reselling and don't have jobs so can spend all day at the box office?

@nineinchnails hi guys. I have been banging on about this for years. I have a concept I would love to show you if you have time/interested?
wrote this new "song" today, kinda reminds me of something @trent_reznor @nineinchnails would make.. trent gimme a gig #trentreznor #NIN #industrialmusic #demo #alldoneonbassguitar https:// youtu.be/Olgnj58NVDI
Get excited!! @nineinchnails is hitting the road this summer! Get the dates and locations from @cavernouseyes here. https:// buff.ly/2L1EHuF
When I search for Closer @nineinchnails is who pops up. Great song
wonder if (when?) musicians will start selling VR experiences that let you experience their previous tours. @DavidBowieReal , @nineinchnails , @marilynmanson have all done some really impressive stage shows. I'd love to go back and see what they were doing in 1990, 2001, etc.

Really disappointed in @nineinchnails and @trent_reznor for not even responding. I called Radio City Music Hall...have to be there that day. They acknowledged how difficult it would be for anyone disabled. It's very upsetting.

Can you imagine seeing @nineinchnails @RedRocksCO I can't imagine how amazing that would be.
Will have $700/day for my little unplanned 2-day Vegas excursion next month. More than enough. Not going so much for the "Vegas Experience" but for the @nineinchnails show. Which will be epic.

Back in for @nineinchnails at the @TheJointLV in June.
Who wants to snag me two tix to the @nineinchnails show in Memphis on Saturday?!? There may or may not be free records involved ;)
@nineinchnails Thank you guys for selling tickets only at the venues!! Now I won't get screwed over.

Funny how @nineinchnails has been there at each significant chapter of my life (well, since The Fragile). This period: #NotTheActualEvents and #AddViolence Thank you @trent_reznor
Ya es 22 de Junio? I need that @nineinchnails album now for fucks sake.
. @nineinchnails - God Break Down the Door (Leak) https:// clyp.it/jnbrqbn2
@Ticketmaster the lack of info on @nineinchnails section/price @RadioCity is annoying
@nineinchnails Les than #nowplaying #votechunk
"God Break Down the Door" is a wild, unexpected ride of a @nineinchnails single. The @DavidBowieReal influence is all over it. Is it NIN or Donny McCaslin Group? Appropriately, this is most sax Trent has been playing on a NIN song since he played Subterraneans live with Bowie.

Really fucking annoyed that the white vinyl for @nineinchnails ' new album was limited and sold out whilst I was at work. Like just do a general goddamn release
With "God Break Down the Door", @nineinchnails has found themselves apart from their former life. Listen: https:// bit.ly/2KzU506 pic.twitter.com/jMaTEkcJC3
Awesome, so because we're 2500 miles from home and they are only selling tickets in person (???) on Saturday, we get to miss the @nineinchnails presale, and therefore the concert. Awesome.

Interesting direction for @nineinchnails . Jazz instrumentation + troubadour vocals from @trent_reznor . Definitely hear the David Bowie influence. Is industrial jazz a thing? #np Nine Inch Nails - God Break Down The Door https:// youtu.be/eeJ_DzRJUI4 #nowplaying

Happy birthday to Trent Reznor of @nineinchnails , Trent, you get more bad ass with age....keep blowing us fans away with ground breaking music! If Mozart were alive today, he would be a NIN fan!
My heart is falling into my toes and my skin is lifting. My hairs are infiltrating back into my scalp one follicle at a time. @nineinchnails is coming to dc.
Hey @nineinchnails let's do some basic math.... @radiocity had 8 ticket windows, with each transaction taking 5 mins - so max 100 people an hour. This was all just a photo op for you at the expense of the #fans , wasn't it! #FuckYouTrent
I am guessing that Mr. Crown is no fan of @nineinchnails either.
The NIN Physical World presale was a huge success -- we got tix to both Phoenix shows -AND- my 13-yr old ultra-cool daughter got the experience of buying tix at a box office - which may never happen again! Thx @nineinchnails @trent_reznor @ComericaTheatre #ninpresale #NINontour
@TheAnthemDC @nineinchnails We came, we saw, and we rode the line ride. We made new friends, heard new tracks, and discovered new levels of soaking wet. 15 hours later we got home with tix! Good job on a well organized event! pic.twitter.com/7zh9fiVjnX

For as crazy as this morning was, and for as bummed as I am that tickets were literally twice cost I expected...I had a great time. Count on @nineinchnails to print a patch labeled 'Anxiety', and then ask us to meet all the other weirdos who wear it. In person. Good times.
