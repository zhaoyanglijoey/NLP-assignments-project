Last night was a highlight, especially for The Lovers of The Fragile. Trent said it was a "weird setlist" but it was wonderful. Flashback to Panorama with Starman's "I Can't Give Everything Away" -- stunning. Well done @nineinchnails and thanks @RadioCity pic.twitter.com/zuk4n3zuQ8

I would like to personally thank @nineinchnails and @RadioCity for last night's show. Everything that was an issue the night before was improved. Sound, merch lines, beer lines and even the set list were all drastically better. Great job everyone. Thanks.

Nine Inch Nails @nineinchnails @kingsbklyn Brooklyn, NY, October 17, 2018. They played Broken EP in full which was fantastic; rest of the set was similar to Radio City night 1.
