I followed @rob_sheridan originally because I was always blown away by his contributions to @nineinchnails . It's morphed into being blown away by his contributions in general to political debate. Thanks for using your platform so well man, it's appreciated.
@nineinchnails please look up KANGA. She is the Vanilla Ice to your Freddie and Bowie.
@nineinchnails , Baraka, Interstellar, & Dark Crystal make essay grading otherwordly.

Just noticed the neighbors getting it started behind their house! So I played @nineinchnails #closer loud as hell from my yard to help set the mood for them! Kinda want to go over and knock on the door and ask if they got a little while to talk about something.
I just realized i wasnt following @nineinchnails on this account, i wonder who else i listen to that im not following on here
I'm tempted to record myself playing Last by @nineinchnails also how long can videos be on here, cause my Black Parade one is like 5 min

And I'm sorry I missed your post haha. I'm sorry to hear of your loss. I recently lost my grandmother and can relate to the void feeling. I ended up playing Ghosts I-IV by @nineinchnails . It's all instrumentals and adds to the reading experience. I'd recommend it to anyone. :)
