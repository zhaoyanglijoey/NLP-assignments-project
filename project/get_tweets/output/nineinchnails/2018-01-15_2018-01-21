@GooglePlayMusic @nineinchnails any reason why Ghosts has suddenly... Well... Ghosted off Google play music? Or why I can't buy physical from nin store?
Currently blasting some @nineinchnails while working. The Year Zero remix album is a goddamn masterpiece. #NineInchNails #Music
Often forgotten! But @nineinchnails are my favourite band of all time so I had to say it!

Hey @trent_reznor , May I get a free ticket for spotting the typo on the @nineinchnails live page? #NIN2018 pic.twitter.com/5qKfBLbtPN
I'm reading the latest Thor by @jasonaaron & @rdauterman and on the page where the Mangog is fighting the Destroyer, the day the whole world went away by @nineinchnails is playing on my phone, couldn't be more apt.
This is cool news. Why the fuck is @trent_reznor / @nineinchnails not in?

Looks like @nineinchnails is traveling to Japan on concert! Awesome! Although, the site suggests they're going to "TOKOYO" (I guess it should be "Tokyo"). They should come drop by Seoul! http://www. nin.com/live/

And I loved watching you drum for @nineinchnails . Saw lots of NIN shows in those days. I mean, I love Ilan too, but the Freese days were damned epic.
Should I travel to Japan in August to see @nineinchnails for the 8th time?
The @nineinchnails ARG for Year Zero has become sentient and we're all living in it. Seems reasonable.

. @nineinchnails Pureset Feeling is such a orgasmic blend of 80's New Wave and Industrial Metal. NIN would have been such a different band if Reznor continued on the path set forth by the album.
Yusssss!!! You'll need to tell me where to start with @nineinchnails ...
Had a blast hanging out with homie @slaterhogan jamming to classics ! @242FRONT242 @Nitzer_Ebb @nineinchnails tonight ! @TiniontheAve #CaliforniaKid #ArizonaKid Crazy how time flies.
We just finished the playlist for tomorrow's show. In addition to our Bay Area band of the week @museumsmusic , we are playing songs from @ilovelucius @Failure @glasser @_Warpaint @TheJudyCollins @nineinchnails and more! Thurs from 5-7PM at KPCA.fm. Thanks!
Stars - they're just like us! And that includes strange neighbors. @nineinchnails main man @trent_reznor has filed for a restraining order against his neighbor who's been behaving "irrationally and threateningly" towards him: http:// bit.ly/2rfwltJ [ | @BackBeatPhotog ] pic.twitter.com/h5VwXNWD36

Completely inappropriately @nineinchnails 's Perfect Drug always reminds me of Colesdottir. Because she's my best antidepressant.

This is just not my week at all... that @nineinchnails song, Everyday is exactly the same really matches this week...
Racking my brain to decide on themes for the short film I'll be making for this EP. I'm really thinking a Broken Movie from @nineinchnails vine, just less gore and more dreamlike visuals. Blugh this is difficult lol.

#MyClassicAlbum would probably have to by @nineinchnails - The Downward Spiral. (Closely followed by FuturePerfect by @VNV_Nation )
Husband is waking up in a couple of hours to do God's work @GreenvilleOaks by manning the video booth. I'm wiped out due to journalistic pipe dreams and @nineinchnails videos on @YouTube . Sweet dreams, friends. Sweet dreams are made of this, who am I to disagree? @BarrettBrown_

@nineinchnails please come to Toronto this year
"Hurt" by @nineinchnails came on today and my 11-year-old son asked, "Didn't Johnny Cash do a version of this song?" That made me very proud.
pretty hate machine by @nineinchnails is prolly one of the darkest album's i've ever heard but it's also one of my favs so
Even after all these years @nineinchnails #prettyhatemachine holds up as one of my favorite albums.
