@trent_reznor @LTLFest so excited for LTL this year!!!!! I have never seen @nineinchnails LIVE!!! pic.twitter.com/r6w1Dcpeyu
@nineinchnails HI, Im film director from Prague. With NiN I live my whole life. Already a long time I am trying to contact @trent_reznor but not successful. I want to shoot music video for NIN. If you want, here is my showreel from 2k16 https:// vimeo.com/210170660
@nineinchnails I want to thank you for the Physical World. Because of it AND you I got to meet an awesome old head and a cool kid. I also got 2nd row center stage at the price point YOU chose and not the 500% mark up a scalper would've chosen for me. Love you. See you Sept 14th
Idk why, but the "cold and black and infinite with nothing left to lose" line from Branches/Bones by @nineinchnails has always resonated with me since the moment I heard the song. Not really near the top of my fave NIN tracks, but that might be a lyric i get a tattoo of one day

@nineinchnails A Warm Place .. so nuanced. 3 bands of perfection: pluck, roiling bass/sub, and the dist-Hammond. Point of reference exemplified ..
my boyfriend said he's taking me to the @nineinchnails concert and I'm still not sure if he's legit being serious.
Hey all you @nineinchnails fans who bought tickets last Sunday at @1079kbpi pre sale! We all got screwed! No convince fees charged now in person for tickets! @axs doesn't care about customers! Sell your tix!

Reminding myself that I have @nineinchnails tickets pic.twitter.com/9IYIefyksx
@nineinchnails there going to be any shows in Seattle on this tour ?
It's crazy how @nineinchnails more or less wrote the terminal NEET anthem. pic.twitter.com/KCXH7MSCmH
Exceptions that prove the rule: Panic! at the Disco, Florence + The Machine, @nineinchnails , Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Cure, Electric Light Orchestra, Evanescence, Motorhead, The Revolution, and Santana.
great song, Wondering if would ever do, an album, of stripped songs, or bare. Like @nineinchnails did with the Still Album?
