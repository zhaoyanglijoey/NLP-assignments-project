It's honestly depressing that whilst Year Zero by @nineinchnails was written during the Bush Administration it sounds more reactive to today's political landscape than that of ten years ago.
PS-I was introduced to your father's music from watching a @nineinchnails home video (the band were getting ready while listening to "Broken Hearts Are for Assholes"-my favorite song). So, this is somewhat like an unorthodox full-circle of sorts for me. Very cool! Thank you!

@lorepodcast Hey guys, I was just wondering who does (or where do you get) the amazing instrumentals that play in the background of the podcast? it sounds SO much like @nineinchnails instrumental album "Ghosts" which Trent Reznor described as "a soundtrack for daydreams" LOVE it

AL AIRE: 2x1 de @nineinchnails
Sometimes wonder how artists like @kendricklamar or @Eminem changed their minds and decided to go accept their grammys, while artists like @nineinchnails or @Tool stuck with their guns and never picked theirs up. Money, or something else at play?
