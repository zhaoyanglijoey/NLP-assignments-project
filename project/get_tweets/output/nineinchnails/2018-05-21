@nineinchnails HI, Im film director from Prague. With NiN I live my whole life. Already a long time I am trying to contact @trent_reznor but not successful. I want to shoot music video for NIN. If you want, here is my showreel from 2k16 https:// vimeo.com/210170660
@nineinchnails I want to thank you for the Physical World. Because of it AND you I got to meet an awesome old head and a cool kid. I also got 2nd row center stage at the price point YOU chose and not the 500% mark up a scalper would've chosen for me. Love you. See you Sept 14th
Idk why, but the "cold and black and infinite with nothing left to lose" line from Branches/Bones by @nineinchnails has always resonated with me since the moment I heard the song. Not really near the top of my fave NIN tracks, but that might be a lyric i get a tattoo of one day
