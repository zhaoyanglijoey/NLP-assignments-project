Hey @nineinchnails let's do some basic math.... @radiocity had 8 ticket windows, with each transaction taking 5 mins - so max 100 people an hour. This was all just a photo op for you at the expense of the #fans , wasn't it! #FuckYouTrent
I am guessing that Mr. Crown is no fan of @nineinchnails either.
The NIN Physical World presale was a huge success -- we got tix to both Phoenix shows -AND- my 13-yr old ultra-cool daughter got the experience of buying tix at a box office - which may never happen again! Thx @nineinchnails @trent_reznor @ComericaTheatre #ninpresale #NINontour
@TheAnthemDC @nineinchnails We came, we saw, and we rode the line ride. We made new friends, heard new tracks, and discovered new levels of soaking wet. 15 hours later we got home with tix! Good job on a well organized event! pic.twitter.com/7zh9fiVjnX
Hope everyone got the @nineinchnails tickets they desired today at the physical onsale events! I'm stoked and can't wait for the shows in the middle of next month, here in #Vegas at @TheJointLV !! #tds #downwardspiral #mrselfdestruct pic.twitter.com/ky1XMphUby

@trent_reznor @nineinchnails Never done it this way before in my life. Made new friends, had an AWESOME Irving staff, celebrated NIN, and got the COOLEST merch to boot. THANK YOU TRENT FOR THE MUSIC & EXPERIENCE!! #NINONTOUR TX pic.twitter.com/0dDeOARTw6
Bout to be alll in that @nineinchnails pit #DownInIt
I spent 4 hours in the Memphis heat to get @nineinchnails tickets, but I got orchestra seats! See you crazy peeps from the line at the show! #NINONTOUR pic.twitter.com/13GXNxHdYF
It wasn't fun waiting 4hrs in the rain (& then leaving empty-handed to catch my train outta town) but my friend stuck it out & 6hrs later we have @nineinchnails tickets to @RadioCity . #NYC #NINonTour #NIN #oldschool
Got our NIN tickets after 8 hours in line! It was grueling and awesome at the same time. Met some fun people too. There, @nineinchnails are ya happy?

For as crazy as this morning was, and for as bummed as I am that tickets were literally twice cost I expected...I had a great time. Count on @nineinchnails to print a patch labeled 'Anxiety', and then ask us to meet all the other weirdos who wear it. In person. Good times.
My day of actual personal interaction with other fans was a blast tyvm Trent btw waiting for tix fo @nineinchnails at the Gon reminiscing many stories of alley line waits of past shows there @101WKQX c ya there kids pic.twitter.com/h9OBsOzMiD
