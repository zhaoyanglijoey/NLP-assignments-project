Devastated to have to miss @nineinchnails at Radio City Saturday night. Damn gallbladder decided it had enough of me and continues to mess up the totally awesome week I had planned. To all who are going, enjoy the show for me, revel in the incredible venue and have fun.
Kinda wanna go see @nineinchnails because @trent_reznor might be the most unique musician ever and I just gotta be a part of that once
Feel like an EPIC Saturday night? #nevermindthenineties returns next weekend, with all the #alternative tracks you've come to know and love. Think early @SmashingPumpkins, @nineinchnails , @Nirvana , @beastieboys + more. #faithnomore #streetpitchwa #perthevents #90smusic
