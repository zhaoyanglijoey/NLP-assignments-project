@nineinchnails my bad. Brokers are already setting resale prices. Bastards.
As an unbashed audiophile, today after however long being in London's orbit and on the inside, I finally heard about @spiritland . Thank you @nytimes subscription, and random equipment searches to faciliate the unadulterated listening experience of @nineinchnails Halo 32.
@nineinchnails I wanna get Trent high and interview him about witch house, Grimes, and the new album so bad.
