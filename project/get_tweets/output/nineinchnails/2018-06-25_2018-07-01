Dat was best fijn @nineinchnails in @AFASLive Ik vond het 4jaar geleden beter, Het geluid was snoeihard. #bloedende oren #NIN #AFAS pic.twitter.com/s0qmOpNWGI
It was pure magic happening right before our eyes. The band has such a great energy, i'm so so so glad I got to witness this, and I hope I will many more times. Thank you for coming, it means the world @trent_reznor @nineinchnails
Wow. Had the best concert experience of my life in Amsterdam seeing @nineinchnails @trent_reznor for the first time. Never seen such a chill but alive crowd and I couldn't have asked for a better setlist. The bits of Trump talking nonsense in The Great Destroyer were just genius
Great show from @nineinchnails at @AFASLive tonight!
Just saw @nineinchnails live! Best light show I've ever seen! Sound was great and the setlist was awesome pic.twitter.com/mQglFtNCUG
It's been a few days but I still can't stop thinking about Sunday night and how incredible it was. [ @nineinchnails at the @RoyalAlbertHall , royally kicking ass] pic.twitter.com/Sk69JfSJRA
Venues in the UK that hold 5,000+ should have a chat with the guys at @AFASLive . The sound for tonight's @nineinchnails show was superb. Crisp, clear and LOUD. Brixton Academy I'm looking at you. #nineinchnails

@nineinchnails So i said you guys just do that one thing you do when someone has tried to steal someone in your family..like Trents kids were in there with their setter @Portisheadinfo ... @FBI you are not shitting us? so someone just stole his cars and vehicles ? yes you seen it
Still dazzled by the intense show of @nineinchnails yesterday in @AFASLive #nin #afaslive #nineinchnails pic.twitter.com/gjRL0GKmLG
#RIP Pat. Saw @nineinchnails w/ him in 2000. After the show he waited in the rain behind the stadium, in the off chance he might meet @trent_reznor . It happened, and Pat got to share a moment w/ a man who had helped define his life. Thx, Trent, for giving him that moment. pic.twitter.com/WLCA6tWWin

@RYANGEE_photo Yo Gee! Listen to @nineinchnails 'Not The Actual Events', 'Add Violence' & 'Bad Witch' all in a row as a trilogy. You'll appreciate the concept as a complete album. Let me know what you think. I think it's a masterpiece by @trent_reznor

The new @nineinchnails LP is pretty sick. I like it. Very noisy.
If your knowledge of @nineinchnails begins and ends with "The Downward Spiral", give these lesser-known albums a listen before checking out their new one: http:// bit.ly/2N6gpR4

@frontiertouring is there a @nineinchnails Aus tour in the offing? Any chance of bringing @TheMaryChain too or is only america worthy of such awesomeness?
The new @nineinchnails album is bloody excellent.
I just heard original "Dead Souls" track from them and it's great. @nineinchnails did a great cover as well for #TheCrow SDTK
Yes. The new @nineinchnails "Play The Goddamned Part" followed by "God Break Down the Door" is amazing for quieting babies.
Just the right food for thought I needed to reflect upon during my vacation. Love @nineinchnails . Perfect inspiration moving forward always. https:// youtu.be/KhMgLssi3VQ
