@Maverick_AC is there any reason @nineinchnails have never played @DownloadFest ? They would make an amazing headline slot. #NINForDL2019
That's not better than @nineinchnails original.
How can even say that, what exactly makes old racist Johnny cash better then @nineinchnails who have been impacting inspiring and saving generations of youth with deep lyrics and beautifully thick layers and textures of sound as well as being years ahead of all OUR favs live
With apologies to @nineinchnails (love you guys) but Johnny Cash's cover of 'Hurt' is everything. https:// youtu.be/FywSzjRq0e4
Dark, deep, powerful. Think @numanofficial @nineinchnails later @thecure @depechemode #Morphine @uglyfacade
How can I listen to heavy metal and BTS? Both take me on emotional journeys-happy sad depressed excited, lonely. Sometimes making me open that Pandora's box of dark emotions I try to bury. Thank you for making me face my demons @BTS_twt @nineinchnails @TheOfficialA7X
