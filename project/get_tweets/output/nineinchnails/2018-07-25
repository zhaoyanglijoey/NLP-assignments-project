So excited to share my new #modularsynth track 'Under the Glove' with you! I recorded this yesterday very early morning before going off to a mate's wedding ;-) This rather sinister track was inspired by @nineinchnails :-) #womeninmusic #eurorack #modular https:// youtu.be/rY9LbyFmyag
Waiting to get into @WeAreMinistry @swxbristol Soundcheck running late. Everyone herded into upstairs bar. Listening to @nineinchnails Pretty Hate Machine on repeat. Lots of men in shorts.
I think we are living @nineinchnails Year Zero .

@sternshow @nineinchnails @robertAbooey @HowardStern @jdharm @Siriusjay @shalomshuli @rqui @trent_reznor listen to The Fragile, the entire album, this weekend. Try to pay attention to the story. #NIN #ninontour
The Fragile by @nineinchnails is the best album ever recorded. Hands down.
There was this incredible moment in the mid-1990s when @nineinchnails and @DavidBowieReal performed a series of shows together. Their rendition of DB's Hallo Spaceboy is my current addiction... "This chaos is killing me" in the best possible way: https:// youtu.be/1X6KF1IkkIc
I listened @nineinchnails a few weeks ago in Berlin and was an excellent performance!
i definitely just blew my car speakers listening to @nineinchnails
@grantmorrison Can you please make a new Heavy Metal movie happen, along with some great music, such as @nineinchnails and @threeteeth ?
@nineinchnails What's up?

Bad Witch de @nineinchnails es un verdadero tributo a @DavidBowieReal

I hate living in a @nineinchnails concept album
For me, it wasn't emo but 90s Alternative (which I still love). I listen to both @BTS_twt and @nineinchnails on a daily basis. The connection? A spectrum of intelligent angst, commentary and stunning visuals. And yes, eyeliner.

I love my @nineinchnails Shirt. pic.twitter.com/210pKdHnjy
Holy fuckin' shit I have a lead on 6th row tix to @nineinchnails in Brooklyn in October!!!! If I pull this off I will be the BEST MOTHER EVER!!!!
Much love for @nineinchnails . Not the Actual Events + Add Violence + Bad Witch was a rewarding first listen from start to finish.
