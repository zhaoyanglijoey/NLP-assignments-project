@iplayedm @TheEDMNetwork @edm @Leftfield @the_prodigy @nineinchnails @billboarddance @Mixmag
I bet @nineinchnails are delighted with this.
After years of mostly hearing the Johnny Cash version of "Hurt", the @nineinchnails version sounds like the cover at this point.
Listening to @nineinchnails 1) Wish 2) Terrible Lie 3) Closer 4) Something I Can Never Have 5) The Hand That Feeds You 6) March Of The Pigs 7) With Teeth

Listening to my Discover Weekly playlist, a song came on which made me stop in my tracks and say to myself "WOW, this sounds EXACTLY like classic Downward Spiral era @nineinchnails ". Obviously ii actually WAS classic Downward Spiral era Nine Inch Nails. Awks pic.twitter.com/aWZvWGV9Bj

I used to love award shows.. Maybe somewhere between not giving a shit made me stop. But truthfully it was when @nineinchnails and Queens of the Stone Age got cut off short during their performance in one of the music awards in 2013 or 2014... I kept my promise. #NeverForget

Almost all my fave bands are coming this summer @prophetsofrage @RobZombie @marilynmanson if only @nineinchnails would announce I would be complete!!

Continuing the industrial vibe, it's @nineinchnails with Heresy. One of my favourite tracks from The Downward Spiral and was lucky to hear it played live when I saw them in Australia in 07 https:// youtu.be/Uvz-fYbFN_o #TOTD 135/176
What was billed as @nineinchnails final concert, at the @wiltern in '09. Went nearly four hours and was the living embodiment of an on stage catharsis for Trent.
@nineinchnails @pfurs might even try for @libertines just @SiouxsieHQ with Robert on guitar!
So @nineinchnails announced a London gig and I am in a constant state of AAAAAHHH

One London date only for @nineinchnails ?? Can't say I'm surprised but I am a bit disappointed considering they did an arena tour last time round. I will be trying like crazy to get tix though. Can't miss seeing them live.

I'm imagining taking photos for that @nineinchnails London show, and I've come to conclusion that I think i would be crying all over my camera the whole time
@nineinchnails @southbankcentre 'Although Royal Festival Hall is a seated venue, you are encouraged to stand at this gig.' Hoping there will still be tickets left after the #members get their pick! #nin
Holy shit! @nineinchnails at Royal Festival Hall as part of @meltdownfest is HUGE!!! Good luck getting tickets to that!

Hey @foofighters . As @nineinchnails are in London for @meltdownfest on June 22 and @trent_reznor is currently gig-free on June 23, seems like you should get him down to the London Stadium for a song or three on that latter date, right? Make it happen!!
@nineinchnails thank you

Go back in time & relive @nineinchnails ' performance of "Closer" during their infamous, mud-caked set at @woodstockfest 1994 -- watch here // http:// bit.ly/2Fls2Um
Incredible, angry, brutally real record that holds up against the unstoppable hands of fucking time. Thank God for @nineinchnails .
