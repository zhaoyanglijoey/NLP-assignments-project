@Apple Walkie Talkie is pretty cool.

Done with my @Apple printed photo albums.
@apple canceling and auto renewal then charging me for it is theft you do know that right. Especially since I was within the free trial, but your support is just being complicit in theft
Dear @apple , why do you STILL have Digital Touch ? pic.twitter.com/R9pmkEjzjB
I fucking hate my thousand dollar MacBook that I paid for @apple
Congratulations @Apple you have successfully stolen $100 and broken the 7 day free trial, in which your support now states even though it says 7 you actually mean 5
Aaaaand.... she just hung up on me. I was not rude, did not cuss, did not raise my voice. @AppleSupport @tim_cook @apple This could cause me to sell my #Apple products.

Fuck you autocorrect @apple
We left @Apple subscriptions completely due to customer service behavior and principal. However some Apple products are so good, iPhone/Mac/Watch, we are caving/rejoining Apple Music. We moved TV subscriptions to competitors, it is better; that Apple TV remote is an abomination.
To @UPSHelp @UPS and @AppleSupport @Apple . What a disappointment the delivery. What a mess. I don't even have my phone yet, it will be available tomorrow and no one can tell me where!

@Apple @AppleMusic you guys need to start putting mixtapes on your damn platform.
@Apple the FaceTime update is really annoying....do not like it at all... takes way to long to flip the camera or mute.... make that just one button please and not have to press one thing and then another...

Why is no one taking @apple to task for their deceptive iPhone Xs ads? All ad images of the phone make it look like their isn't that ugly notch at the top of the screen. It's clever marketing but very deceptive.

Hey @Apple I have small hands please stop making the damn phones bigger. If I wanted a bigger screen I would use my iPad.
@Apple my earphone went out now I just have speakerphone
I don't like the fact that @apple doesn't tell you that all the space being taken up in your phone is actually bullshit that has nothing to do with apps or what you've already cleared to make space for? Apple out here pulling a Zuckerburg move for real. What are you hiding?

@Apple has become such a dissapointment. Giving less while charging more, making devices harder to use and forcing consumers to spend more money to buy extras that for the price paid should be included. Just goes to show the power of a brand and a logo.
@Apple bring back the OG FaceTime sound.
Amazing !!! @tim_cook @Apple
Hey @Apple I need you to please do something about this
I wish @Motorola still made the classic Razer flip-phone and that @apple still made the iPod video. I would get rid of my smartphone in a heartbeat.
Things should be intuitively designed, something that @Apple has, in my opinion, mastered and is the reason why they are so successful. The gestures used to navigate iOS, for example, are extremely intuitive and can be learned without instruction. @NU227_commtech #nu_comm227
I guess submitting a video before having a face-to -ace could be misused to discriminate. I've not been asked for such. Well, how diverse is Apple's product team? Are Latinos and African Americans present amongst developers, product managers, and directors. #AppleNews @Apple

Use AI against the Cabal. Why is @apple suggesting that I research Catholic Church child sex abuse cases when I receive a notification about Michael Crichton writing about infants getting raped by MANY PEOPLE who are elites in power. #Pizzagate #Pedogate pic.twitter.com/QBJvkM1cum
iOS 12 FaceTime and photos and photos within messages is fucking trash @Apple @AppleSupport

@Apple I have to say, the Mojave update is beautiful! Smooth and sexy. Great job!

I don't want to update to High Sierra because everything works fine. I have to update to High Sierra to use the latest Xcode. I update to High Sierra. My Mac won't boot anymore. Lovely, @Apple .

Hey @Uber -had the best experience ever today from Christopher in Hyundai KJY6143. I left my @Apple EarPods in the backseat. He not only returned them to me, but texted me to find a time to meet, offered to rearrange his schedule to accommodate me AND he charged them. #uberrocks
Forcing #iOS users to have to decide between assisting abducted children or receiving propaganda from a #psychopath fake #potus via his " #PresidentialAlertSystem " is hardly fair to the children @apple For now, I will be turning off my #alert feature & rely on news updates.

. @Apple , how do I opt out of #PresidentialAlerts ? Seriously, the only things that really require a direct line to the entire population are probably things I don't want to know about. Anything else is going to be from our Wannabe Dictator, and I still don't want to know.

@TutuApp_vip First of all fuck you. Second of all my mom has a Joy-Stick for @PokemonGoApp I use @Samsung because @Apple sucks. My mom is making me pissed! Can you put you tutubullshit on Android please?
@apple will take -30 seconds to take money out of my account and over 10 business days to put that shit back

Hey @Apple can you fix the weird zoomed camera that happens on some apps? Does this happen to anyone else with the iPhone Xs Max ? #iPhoneXSMax
iPhone lightning charger cables are evil. Why are they so finicky and short lived @Apple ?
I pre-ordered the #AStarIsBorn soundtrack and #iTunes keeps saying the download is pending. I need this soundtrack @apple after this week! Please send help!

I @apple I do! I really love @Applesupport . But I purchased an iPhone 8 in 12/18 and this week I received my 5th iPhone 8. Why b/c each 1 has had some issue that has made it impossible for me to just basically make phone calls. I am currently waiting 4 another 1
Is it wrong to go out of your way to complete the circles when you soo close to completing it? @Apple #closingcircles #AppleWatch . pic.twitter.com/8DoFTHlFjR
@apple i hope your headquarters gets blown up
Consumers should be educated that EXIF data in most photo uploads, combined with GeoIP data from network, provide a detailed history of locations. Perhaps @apple and @Android should add a feature when allowing an app access to Photos to optionally strip EXIF data before app use
Mucho @Apple pa esto.
@apple is all of this profile resetting and payment and permission resetting part of the newest update? Essentially none of my services are working normally?
@Apple #shortcuts should be accessible from control center like home app. It just makes sense along other quick utilities. Share sheet is too slow. Finding the app on home screen is too slow.
@Apple uses #Intel chips in their desktop offerings, I understand the comparison but #Apple would never put the A12 inside of a desktop platform. No other chipset competes with #iPhone sinces its all custom designed and runs #iOS .
have you realized Apple didn't make a iPhone 9? why? @Apple @exodusbargblor
@Apple Can you please stop putting (Optional) in your outgoing server settings on your mobile devices? Every tech support person on the planet with thank you since they won't have to deal with nearly as many calls from people saying that their email won't send.
I've had this Mac book Pro since 2012... and it's still in perfect condition. @Apple you should be proud! pic.twitter.com/Nqw76LNhHl
@Apple Watch not showing TSA pre on boarding pass makes it useless to Known travelers. I always have to use my phone to show it at the line.
@Apple dropping all these phones and all these updates but still no group FaceTime...
@DietCoke and @Apple could chip in too, they are getting some free advertising on social media and the news outlets.
@business @technology @emilychangtv #@RepChrisStewart : #ChineseHacking : I am concerned that @Amazon & @Apple denied it happened. I have no doubt The #CIA would do the same thing!!!

1/2 Sucks when you travel with your iPhone with headphones that have the lightning connector and the plane entertainment system has the headphone jack. Thanks @Apple for making me buy a crappy 2$ airplane headphones and keep mine in my pocket.
I have never been more proud to own an android phone in my time using smartphones. iPhones just don't give me what I want in a phone any more and it's a bit of a shame. But, hey. It's @Apple 's loss. #icantdroiddose
It's funny to see all these youtubers do the videos to explain the -gates for apple instead of @Apple itself.

@Apple Just confirmed with two Apple people at witnesses, down Scottsdale store. My #AppleWatch 4 is NOT the only one with non-working complications! 3/3 watches I picked up in the store have the same issue. Must be a server problem or the whole first run is defective. #FIXNOW
Thanks @Apple .
we should be able to leave FaceTime voicemails @apple

You ever sit back and wonder about the millions upon millions of lives @apple has saved by changing the gun emoji to a squirt gun? They should probably change the hammer emoji to a pillow as well, just to be safe. pic.twitter.com/0lomsnReHF
my phone went from 40% to 8% in like 5 minutes @apple how?!?
Ok @apple asses. @tim_cook if should be up to us if we want to use #cellular data for lg downloads and updates not you.
No joke.... @apple turned up the goods in the Apple Watch Series 4.... in love with the speed, screen, larger size and added functions!
@Apple
Customer service @Apple is top notch
According to an internal @Apple service document, any #Mac with a T2 chip now requires proprietary diagnostics to complete certain repairs. It's been lauded by tech publications as a certified bricking machine for third-party repair technicians https:// ifixit.org/blog/11673/

@Apple please undo the update that causes my phone to freeze every 10 seconds because you released a new phone. Plz thx.
@Apple add FaceTime voicemails
No @Spotify on the new @Apple Watch really killed the excitement for me. Thought I would be able to run without my phone. If only tech companies could play nice for the sake of customers...

@Apple , if you read this, we want FIDO2 on iOS! Please open up NFC by allowing writes, so that apps and security keys can implement the FIDO2 standard on iOS. #FIDO2iOS #SoloKickstarter https:// solokeys.com/kickstarter

Travel to #2007 in this week's edition of our 50th-anniversary playlist countdown. During that year, the @apple iPhone was unveiled, and the final @HarryPotterFilm book was published. Do the D.A.N.C.E. to it on @SpotifyUSA this weekend @justicesoitfete http:// spoti.fi/2E7fKyL
They advised me to restore the phone, after restore GPS has problems along with app crashing. I visited genius and @Apple AGAIN restored the phone, now it has notifications issue, although there are no notifications, my phone keeps showing notifications on the apps.
Now all I need is #darkMode on my #iPhone @Apple
@Apple apparently my dads getting me one for Christmas (the 512GB one) and omg they look amazing!

Dear @apple it'd be cool if when I searched in iTunes the exact hit on my search term came out on top. Some artists are literally unfindable unless you know the name of their work

Bullshit! First Google said by the end of the month (September), then they said by the end of the week (today), now it's been changed to, "the coming months". Thanks you @WearOSbyGoogle and @HuaweiDeviceUSA for making my decision to switch to @Apple products for me!

The @apple photo app has decided my 75 lb dogs are classified as cats. Also, two owls. I think they still have some work to do on their algorithms.
the "geniuses" at @apple & @applesupport apparently haven't figured out a way to backup an iPhone to an external drive. What a joke. I'm glad I own a @SamsungMobile device
Hey @Apple @AppleSupport stop making shitty cables and if you are have the decency to replace them. pic.twitter.com/TbnwNPYuTL
It should appear obvious to @Apple and @tim_cook why we need an app with secure tokenization on our phone. We need a more direct democracy. When the legislature is incapable of legislating on behalf of the majority, the people need to govern themselves directly.
I wonder when @CommBank will give us @Apple Pay @AppleSupport
