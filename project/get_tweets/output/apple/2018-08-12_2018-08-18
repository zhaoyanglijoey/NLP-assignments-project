@Apple 2/2 I have brought It in twice to see the problem. No one can figure It out. No problems no solutions just me walking away with a dead product after 2 years. Do I still have my MacBook from 2009 yes. And my iMac from 2011? Yes both working perfectly.
@Apple
Ah yes @Apple I love when you guys take my money when I only have $30 until payday
@Apple 1/2 You have been a company I have loved for years. And I have sadly watched you deteriorate slowly as you care less and less about your products and care more about marking money. My watch that is 2 years old has something wrong where the battery last a half a day.
Best thing about the iPhone X this battery be lasting mad long finally @apple got it together
FOR MONTHS @apple has been pestering me in OS to update, I've continually declined. Last night, I'm like, FINE, UPDATE YOU PIECE OF SHIT and it turns out now I can't play any of my Steam games on Mac because they decided to nix OpenGL. Fuck you, Apple.

Dear @Apple , forcing app devs switch to subscription model is the stupidest idea ever. While it is short term good looking strategy for business heads with calculator instead of brain (and heart), customers are mostly affected and very unhappy with this model. #wayToTheHell
It's laughable that people think @Google @Apple @Spotify @facebook are anything other than mercenary corporations. They will sell out everyone and everything for power. Like him or not, @RealAlexJones is a test case for censorship and enforced social obedience. Good luck sir
OK @Apple , your horseshit "upgrade" to the iTunes payment process has left me so angry and dissatisfied, I will NOT buy the music I was 2-seconds away from buying from you. HDTracks, here I come. (There's are reasons I dumped all my Apple products.)
OK! @apple - vote against the touch bar: when I'm using VoiceOver, I can't use the `cmd + F5` shortcut to turn VoiceOver off anymore! VoiceOver just reads out "F5 button".

Wanna know somthing? @Apple 's 11.3 iOS update deactivated my microphone; FaceTime, phone calls, even voice memos will not work. It's all grayed out. The worst part? Apple has acknowledged the glitch in the update and refuses to do anything about it.
Well @Apple I already avoid subscriptions as much as possible. There is no way I use an app enough to pay an outlandish monthly fee.

There are days, like today, @apple really lets their customer down by how crappy their customer service is when you have a broken device. #boo #youwhores
@Apple @tim_cook Why doesnt apple build manufacturing facilities here in the u.s. For iphone, ipad, ipod. I suggest eastern new mexico, western Oklahoma or Texas along I 40.
I love you @Apple , but for the love of all that is holy: STOP pushing developers towards a subscription model. Please. Consumers hate it, and it will drive them to other platforms. Stop.
@Apple @AppleSupport While using facetime, when switching apps, or someone else is, it would be cool to where the app would just fade the screen, or say pause over it instead of the gray screen.

So yest my #AppleMacAir was streaming no probs from #AmazonPrime #Netflix etc, then I did an update to my computer and guess what? You betcha, nothing. Taken me 6 attempts to watch an ep of #TheGoldenGirls FFS! Gave up. And yes Ive restarted etc etc @Apple

Just bought the new MacBook Pro 15" with 8th Gen I7, 6 core and 16GB RAM. Free Beats headphones included. Had to get a new Magic Mouse to go with it. Can't wait to start coding on my new development computer. Thanks @Apple @AppleSupport
This is the note from your senior advisor. @Apple @AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/jR9zLtsgGe
Obrigada Apple por fazer cabos maravilhosos, obrigada seus arrombados @Apple
Most smartphone companies other than @Apple needs to rely on freebies to sell their newly announced flagship products on the first few weeks of release. What a poor thing. pic.twitter.com/ftdMUdWM2w
another day, another random @WordPress problem. How this "CMS" got to power 40% of the internet just boggles my mind The equivalent would be @Apple saying, "We're launching our next iPhone with zero built-in apps! And there will have no QC over apps developed by others!"
@Apple @AppleSupport During this entire time even the spare phone stopped working and I had no phone for 2 days. Then when I got back to the senior customer service representative after I had collected the phone as per her instructions,
@Apple @AppleSupport the phone in that state from the state and ship it (at my cost) to her so she could effect a replacement at her end and send me a new phone for the trouble I was made to endure. So i followed her instructions.
@Apple @AppleSupport Because of these protests, the store offered a 50% waiver on the replacement cost so as to compensate for their initial goof up. I was livid. Am I here to bargain? I spoke to a senior advisor on the apple care helpline regarding this who then asked me to take
@Apple @AppleSupport of the policy regarding physical damage and replacements. SHOCKING !! I was shocked that a trillion dollar company in market cap treats its customers this way. I objected and demanded that original terms of what I was told be upheld.
@Apple @AppleSupport A day later, I received an email saying that for the replacement to be effected I would need to pay $700+ since there was minor physical damage at the back of the phone or I would get it back in its dysfunctional state.
@Apple @AppleSupport The "genius" advisor at the store assured me that I would be given a FREE replacement since the device was still under warranty and the phone genuinely was spoilt. A spare phone was given to me till I would receive the replacement.
@Apple @AppleSupport wrt Case -100603465056/ Repair No: R390604938 My experience has been nothing short of torturous. I went into your store at Eaton Centre in Toronto on the 31st of July to look into why my 3 month old iPhone X suddenly stopped recognizing my sim card service.
