@Apple Would you bring an option to try the gesture interface on TouchID devices such as the iPhone 8? Or is it an exclusive feature to the iPhone X? The gesture bar as an option would be good though (maybe as an alternative to AssistiveTouch).

Unbelievable, I was just wondering when Apple is finally going to realize that they are overcharging for the MacBooks, also why would you charge so much just to add or upgrade to SSD ? I mean seriously @apple #appledoesntcare #greed

@Apple ok this is a little crazy! I got my apple pencil with the iPad exactly 30 days ago and all of the sudden the apple pencil stopped working?! Can someone help me?! I work with this stuff! On the support page I only have the option for a call tomorrow! I need it ASAP!

Amen on that. There are bigger players coming ( @sbigroup f.i.) and CB knows. They have fear. Like @swiftcommunity fears @Ripple . Like @nokia used to fear @Apple . We all know what happened.
Dear @Apple , how did you fuck up autocorrect so badly on this last update?
@creditkarma Where is your app on the @Apple Canada @AppStore

Look. I've been an @Apple user for decades. I still have a working Mac Classic. But today, for the first time, I realized that Apple does not use the Oxford comma on their website and my brand loyalty has been shaken to the core.
@Apple should now fix the software part of this battery system. I am using iPhone 7 Plus, after iOS 11.4 and 11.4.1 updates iPhone is fast charging and fast charging is finished -solve this problems
I would like to thank not only God, but also @Apple today I found my phone in the lake. After 19 hours of it being submerged in water and 5 hours in rice, IT WAS FINE! I am shook.
I've spilled water on my laptop 6 times, puked on it, had soda leak on it, dropped it on pavement, all I've gotta say is as much as I hate @apple 95% of the time, the build quality is tougher than ever expected
According to @Apple 's own website, my decked out 2017 13" Macbook Pro is worth $0 trade in and "ready for recycle". Now *that's* what I call planned obsolescence.

The #MacBookPro keyboard has seemed annoyingly loud to me ever since I started using it about a year ago. Looks like @Apple took notice and made some changes. @TechCrunch tested how much quieter they really are: https:// buff.ly/2Nd2OXE
Don't get the Air. Get the Macbook Pro which was updated on Friday or the Macbook which hasn't been updated but is still a better Mac than the Air. Always check the excellent @MacRumors Buyers Guide before you shell out on @Apple !

Dear @Apple media agency, please dial back the frequency or rotate the promoted content on Twitter. That Grimes spot is stale AF.
Im guessing that is the @Apple Dongle with @Samsung Headphones. That right there could be the reason. jk. Not sure why though.
Dearest @Apple an d @AppleSupport I do not want to set up apple pay on this device now or fucking ever and your repeated attempts to get me to do so are seriously straining our generally amiable relationship. You assholes.

Having a really bad experience with @AppleSupport . My watch is not working and I keep getting lines that are not true. Very disappointing @Apple .
@Apple , please tell me WHY you are STILL using a 720p iSight camera in your 2018 MacBook Pro(or even all of your latest Macs)? At a starting cost of $1799. I expect a absolute MINIMUM 1080p camera. Disappointed in whoever is making these decisions . #Apple

You know already that you need to change your phone when it gets slower every time you update your iOS @Apple are you rlly slowing it down on purpose?
Thank you @Apple for quietly releasing a brand new upgraded MacBook Pro just a couple weeks after I bought a now old one.
@Apple we need an #iphone with 500GB or 1 TB worth of storage. Also, this phone needs to be #phablet size. I have big hands. What's the sense of an @AppleMusic subscription and #4K video if we can't store it? Trick question. It doesn't make sense. #thanks #technology @CNET
