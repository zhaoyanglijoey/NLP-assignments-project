@apple , why do your phones make the camera noise whenever you take a screenshot? I took a screenshot in the bathroom and my dad probably thinks I was taking a dick pic. ;-;
the more I use these #Apple lightning headphones, the more I'm hating the overall discussions @Apple is making in a post Jobs world.
Over two hours later and no response, nothing from @AppleSupport or @iTunes disappointing. Especially now that I have over 200 movies that @apple could take away from me at any time with no way for a refund. Guess I should stick to Blu-rays from now on.

So I get the next text from @Apple and click the link to reset it. Care to guess what happens next? Of course it restarts the entire process. Now I call back and speak to a "Senior" adviser and they tell me I'm "in good hands"....okay
Okay, that's dumb, but whatever. So I wait a few days, get the text from @Apple . Follow the link, and instead of resetting, it just starts the whole process over along with another unknown waiting period....

Love @Apple , but that MacBook Pro is ridiculous!
My options are to get dressed and go back out to get the office to get the cable, or just pull my clunky Windows laptop out and set that machine up for recording instead. I cannot think of single user-centric justification for eliminating all common laptop ports, @Apple why

I just picked up my MacBook from a repair attempt at the @Apple store and this is how it came back - covered in dust! pic.twitter.com/CiqiGw2Uvs
@Apple , why is it that when my macbook is near the AppleTV, I use the remote and my laptop opens iTunes and affects the volume?

@MTA why are you allowing @Apple to use the Church F/G station for a private podcast? Especially when the prospect / 15th stations are closed? You have apple staff blocking free access to the train platforms, & there is a consent to taping notice. Pretty unacceptable timing.
horrible experience here at @apple today
Beachballing constantly since the initial setup, and continues throughout installing applications, adding cards to wallet, browsing websites, etc. Looks like this is going back for a full refund. Sad, @Apple . Actually, pathetic. pic.twitter.com/WIgvilWNTw

@Apple park #cupertino visitor center = yet another lousy apple store, nothing more.
Wow, @wanderingzito , that same happened to me also and the @Apple Store told me there was nothing they could do unless I paid $289 for a replacement. So, I abandoned the new watch. Is it true that I can tweet @AppleSupport and get help that way instead?

@Apple UPDATE your weather app, it sucks
So now I've tried using a mobile hotspot from my #Samsung mobile. Has worked in the past but not today. I don't get shit like this from @Samsung devices. More #dirtytricks from @Apple to make me upgrade? Probably #profiteering #Shameless

So I'm away from home and my iPad won't connect to the guest Wi-Fi. @Apple activation server not working, need to plug the iPad into iTunes via my pc (that's at home) Fucking useless from Apple
@Apple @ING_es somos muchos los clientes que necesitamos ya #ApplePay !!
I, too, hoped for a greener experience when I left @ATT for @sprint 'cuz it was cheaper. Grrrr #Mistake I'm not ever ready to leave @SamsungMobile for @Apple Not in this lifetime. Perhaps, @Lesdoggg your less than ideal experience with support is the exception. Let's hope!
I found an old phone with a bunch of old pictures videos and apps on it. I turned on the wifi and the phone restarted and everything got deleted. What the FUCK @AppleSupport @apple I want all those photos and videos back FUCK there were so many memories
One of my radar bug report for macOS Mojave is just closed on Saturday afternoon. Wondering if someone is working over this weekend at @Apple .

Let me just say that @netflix needs to pick up @shanedawson before @apple gets him. @youtube is stupid for not giving him the recognition he deserves.
@Apple is part of the swamp.

New iPhone Leak Confirms Apple's Serious Problem - http:// bit.ly/2LSPzuK >> If the performance numbers are correct, @Apple is making its users experience subpar performance due to modem change from @Qualcomm to @Intel . Supplier quarrels should never be on the backs of users.
I actually once walked up to the @Microsoft store and said wow the @apple store is not very crowded and then instantly ........ well ya know.

I'm at @Apple Eaton Centre in Toronto, ON https://www. swarmapp.com/c/87rhtUDYpB8
@apple needs to do way better with its iMessage search. It is really really bad.
I love how @Apple tries to fix simple thermodynamics with a software update, really goes to show how much of a joke @Apple Is becoming. If you are blatantly lying to your customers, maybe you need to think about reanimating your previous CEO.
Well done, @Dave2Dtv ! Now that @apple has your ears, how about asking them to return to the good 'ol days of having ports and repairable and upgradeable Macs? You know, REAL PRO machines.

It even went MAGA, talking about Congress trying to steal from regular ppl and Trump is helping cause he cares. Magic Vietnamese battery patents, suing @Apple and @Samsung for patents, maga and ERMAHGERDS. This will end well.

I got 5 ppl sitting behind me being talked into buying battery patents to sue @Apple and @Samsung ... Lol. Knows a guy that knows a guy that has "revolutionary" battery tech in Vietnam. Good luck getting robbed dummies.
@Apple @AppleSupport why do you insist on upgrades that drain iPhone batteries 11.4.1 turned my new phone into a phone that drains power within minutes and yes I have closed many apps etc to save power- what's your solution
can I be sponsored by @Apple I need a new phone !
@PlayStation @Apple @AppleMusic can we get Apple Music as an app for the Ps4?
