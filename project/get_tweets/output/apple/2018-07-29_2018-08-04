I love almost everything else about it! The quad-core 2.7 i7 is a beast. I just wish @Apple could also add a discrete graphics card or at least support @nvidia eGPU. This is the first 13" laptop I've felt could replace a desktop, it just needs a GPU.
So today was the 1st day I tried coding on a Touch Bar MacBook. @Apple shouldn't be allowed to call this a "Pro" computer without a dedicated escape key. Why don't they do it like the power button and make it a key on the left? It's been driving me nuts. This gap is horrible! pic.twitter.com/NgiQmCzx53

Reading about upcoming products the other day, I realized we're quickly approaching a time when, after 30 years of using @apple Mac products, they won't offer a single new product I'm interested in purchasing. They have designed me out of their products.

@Apple is already doing that. Any company that wants to be operate in China has 2 options: 1) Abide China's rules and work with their government 2) or be censored and kicked out. That is why users should never trust any company. Every company has ties to governments.

Your tweets say one thing but your credit card says another, and @apple only listens to one of those.
@Apple @AppleSupport do live wallpapers only work for lock screens and not home screens? Or is there something wrong with my phone?
To put @apple market cap in perspective, AAPL is worth two Facebooks, seven Netflixes, 42 Twitters, and 53 Dells. Facts from @macworld
Congratz @Apple
Thanks for the chance. We love @FoxwoodsCT and @Apple We would love to win.

@tim_cook @Apple Congratulations sir Tim & Apple for reaching $1 trillion market cap. It's a world and historical record. May Steve Job's guiding light make Apple even greater and truly make the world a better place. God bless, Matthew 16:18 @GWR @BoSanchez @TheFQMom @Nasdaq
Now @apple y'all charge 1000 dollars for 64 GB @SamsungMobileUS 1000 for 1tb on the note 9 #yallfuckedup
Sitting here at the only @apple store in Omaha, NE for a 5:45pm appointment. They're understaffed and running about 20 people behind for an appointment we set 2 weeks ago because they were that backed up. 1 Trillion dollar market value and the experience is horrible.

@InfinixNigeria the reason @Apple put a notch on the #iPhoneX was because the phone was truly bezel-less and they needed a place to put the front sensors. What's your excuse? Corporations be taking the absurd and blatant copying of @Apple #ANotchHigher
I want Apple Watches to be able to fit everything an iPhone X has someday! #AppleWatch #iWatch #Watch #iPhoneX #iPhone10 #iPhone #iOS #Apple @Apple They can save lives sometimes now, but I bet they can save more lives in 10 years!
Hearing about @Apple taking advantage of my grandma today at the Genius Bar breaks my heart shame on you #losgatos #ipad Never let seniors walk in there alone!
Alright @Apple when are we gonna have Pirate emojis? There are , zombies , vampires ... also ninjas would be nice
Give Apple money to make cooler stuff! $8 is a great deal, and you can pay it off sooner if you save a few hundred bucks over a year or two! #iPhone8 #iPhone #iOS #Apple @Apple #Sprint @Sprint pic.twitter.com/RG8zGd1uLg
@apple should buy @onepeloton solely for the customer lifestyle symmetry--they're used to a closed ecosystem, no having to go outside your walled garden and interact with the sweaty plebes (android users/gym rats). @dealbook
Stunning @Apple #developer customer support! => Day 8 <= of #MBP keyboard repairs & 0 status updates. Shall I declare this MBP MIA?! @AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/CCRojZH8YS
That is why @apple is a trillion dollar company
Yo @Apple what kinda bananas coding is this that female emojis render this way in text previews pic.twitter.com/Mr6ihPbUdG
@Apple I'm Tired Of Your Updates. You End Up Taking Away Helpful Shortcuts!
@Apple worth $1 trillion. What is this madness. What do you do with that much money?
hey @Apple are you hearing! Congratulations for your Victory! #AppleFirstTrillion
I'd argue and go further back, expect less and you'll be happier @Apple pic.twitter.com/bHnOEq6O5h

As a Wildland Firefighter and an employee of Apple, this means a lot. Thank you @tim_cook @Apple
The fact that I can dislike my own iMessage is why I have an #iPhone Thank you @Apple
Our #IPhone #Sucks making us very sad about @apple #products The quality is just not there anymore. They use inferior supplies to built their #Imacs and #batteries and #Scammed America like @facebook @AppleNews @AppleSupport @AppleTV Big #disappointment to @REBELTV lately! pic.twitter.com/VfXlSV6oqp
imagine if you could share your battery with someone with another iphone @Apple
@Apple why is my app store trying to charge me for updating my apps ?
I've always wanted a stylus that could really look like my handwriting without marks from my hand or those uneven lines, crooked letters and smudges. This is THE best electronic tool for my OC nature! Thank you @Apple pencil! pic.twitter.com/qsZs4MUcQ3

For a week, @Apple failed to get App Store to work for @ios 12 beta 4 users. This is the level of software quality in Apple today. Time to switch back to the sane side.
Did @apple receive a warrant when they let Feds cease control of my #iPhoneX purporting to be an apple employee. In #Roseville store. Or was manager just trying to be a patriot and ended being a traitor to the #USA @acslaw 3rd party cam and heavy bevel added to #iphone
unlocking the mac with the watch really comes in handy thx @Apple

@EpicGames , making money hand over fist, doesn't want to fist over money to @Google , who is making money hand over fist, but they do hand over money to @Apple , who is making money hand over fist. I don't know who to even root against..
Congrats to @apple making it into 1 trillion market cap. Wonder if Blockchain played an influence? Any thoughts @jungleincxrp
Drove 30 mins to @Apple store on Saturday since my iPhone X Face ID randomly stopped working. Got there 11 mins late to find out if ur 10 mins late they auto cancel ur appt! Horrible experience! APPL should of told me that when I made my appt over a week ago!
New hobby project: make Touch Bar suck less. Here is an interesting article on the subject: http:// vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/ @Apple
The idea of cloud computing is great, but @apple and everyone needs to realize when you pay for an HD movie, you should have unlimited access to it. If your internet connection has a hiccup, you end up with SD and/or the inability to play your PURCHASED movie.

@Apple is turning a loyal fangirl into an enraged customer. For one year, I have been trying to recover my password. ONE YEAR. Why can you not send me a link via email to reset like every other company in the world?! #Apple #custserv
FYI - Let the record show I'm not anti @Apple at all your honour. Never know if the big wigs are listening and may want to sponsor a blog. Was once heavily invested in their workstations and pro apps pre Steve Jobs until pricing policy sky rocketed. pic.twitter.com/TvooyQeHid
@Apple Deaf means get lost if you're trying to get help! I was kept waiting because nobody wanted to deal with a deaf person when I needed help with an iPad that was faulty after two months of purchase! A year later I'm still trying to deal with the issue ... shocking

If someone had dared to buy $10,000 worth of @Apple stock in 1997, as the company teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, the investment would now be worth about $2.6 million. http:// bit.ly/2LSaGBs

@MKBHD do you know how I know that the new @apple iPhoneX is coming? The battery on my old iPhoneX all of a sudden started to die half-way through the day under the same utilization. Used to last almost the entire day though...
Worst service ever, no wonder by delivering faulty products you are into Trillions of dollars. @Apple
