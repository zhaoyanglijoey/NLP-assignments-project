@AppleSupport @Apple never works w/any @NFL Mobile app. $ AAPL is overrated garbage- and #NFLRedzone -why would you sign off 16 mins to 8 when @MiamiDolphins / @Titans are still playing?

@SamsungUS So because your system doesn't allow address change for current orders and you couldn't send out your phone on time, I am out $100 bucks on my trade in. Thinking about cancelling all together and seeing what @apple comes out with this month.

@apple please make an option for changing color of markup text or add a stylus like the Galaxy Note for those of us who value neatness. Your product are no longer geared towards working professionals in the arts, but of course you know that already.

@Apple you need to fix this auto brightness. If my phone is on 1% I turn the shit down for a reason. Not for your stupid ass update to change it right back.

Things @Apple needs for iPhones: 1. Message files. So I can avoid sifting through months worth of messages from baby, to remember cute stuff. Give me folders I can label - Weekly or Daily folders of threads would be ideal. 2. Locks on certain messages cause... again..bae threads.

After hearing about the other one I browsed the Mac App Store and noticed so many of those "Dr" apps with obviously fake reviews, and I thought: These have got to be scams. How can I notice that in 10 seconds and @Apple doesn't at all? It's a junk store. Is @Apple notifying users
even worked at @Apple I'm decidedly not a fan of smartphones, just can't use it properly
@apple @applesupport It totally shows. Siri is the most lackluster feature in the Apple universe.

Heh, haven't even had iOS 12 loaded on my phone for a day and already found a glaring regression bug in their new Screen Time feature. Screen Time ignores device name and refers to it as just "iPhone". Worked fine in earlier betas. Oh, @Apple ...

@AppleEDU @apple @PlayOsmo #osmointheclassroom #GivingMyAllGMA Check out my classroom on @DonorsChoose ! I'd love your help to bring my project to life: https:// donorschoo.se/e/u0YrHfjSbQ
Hey @Apple we know what you did ... no #wireless charging pad that you told us was coming like a year ago?! #android is coming for you but truth be told I still #believe
I really hope that @apple is working on a new IPad Pro I need a new one already.
What do you think of the new #iphones announced from @Apple - @LTrainRadio #funny1060am #TheLTrainShow http:// bit.ly/2Mwq0zc pic.twitter.com/S2z6otM6Ff
New iPhone out? Omgg pleaseee @Apple do not make mine mysteriously stop working now. Please.
Wish me luck @Apple pic.twitter.com/0lKr6w4try
No idea, but it was my last one and it is my next one. Too sick of @apple horrid voice dictation & text entry. Needs a BP app for how much it raises mine ~~ and ire.
@Apple @SamsungMobile how do you feel about this???
@Apple can we add functionality to the Apple Wallet to have my Drivers license/ID?? Please it would be super nice.
Stop freezing my phone u turds @Apple
My 2018 Toyota Highlander plays music automatically when I start the car. Even after I pause it, it will resume for some magical reason. So maddening. Is this just an @Apple #ios thing?
Lol, I just noticed they put the official @Apple email in the Carbon Copy line.
Damn right, I mean technically I'm not much better because I really want a Note 9, but then again it's got current tech in it, rather than stuff @Apple are two years behind on.
@Apple Will there be a redesigned MacBook Air or MacBook this year?
Dear @apple the Macbook camera could use an upgrade too.
Definitely not upgrading I miss the $199 upgrade days of the past @Apple
It could have been big but @Apple continues to deliberately create a problem in order to sell a solution. Bring back the 3.5mm jack. No, a separate piece customers have to buy (and buy again once lost/broken) isn't "just as good". Not all vehicles are bluetooth compatible.
@Apple Please add a sloth emoji ASAP. That is all. Thanks. #emoji #sloth #ineedit pic.twitter.com/lwo2Anxamz
@Apple I have corrected your map online 6 times for our biz as instructed and now have emailed you w/ your promise to get right back to me? Do you want to help? #seriouslyapple #stillwaiting
I almost feel like the @Apple #iPhone and #AppleWatch launch didn't happen, because even though I have seen the adds and heard news I am not hearing anyone outside of that talking them up, tech sites seem to have gone "meh", influencer's are silent, it just seems to have fizzled
I think that is a big issue, that matter. If you buy something, digital or other wise, is yours. @Apple or any other #company has the right to remove it, from your collection. You go to a store and buy a phone if they stop selling it, they can't go your home to get it.
http://www. buzzsprout.com/182451 On the latest episode of @cyberpunkfm , Adam and Sharim discuss all the latest reveals from the recent @Apple Event. And be on the lookout for a #SpiderManPS4 review this weekend. If @adamgbascle ever stops doing side-quests, that is.

This is the @apple emoji for food .
@Apple https:// youtu.be/iol8n3m88SA I was totally wanting one of these but then I saw the stupid Emoji never ever.
@Apple what did you do with @PostMalone tattoos pic.twitter.com/WdC9DJJ0Sv
yo @Apple listening to music for 20 minutes costed me 42 percent. send me an xs, thanks.
Use @Android stuff they make is path breaking. @Apple regularly gets inspired by them.
https:// youtu.be/iol8n3m88SA Never seen a YouTube video get these many views in such a small amount of time. Also actually a great video. Audio track is perfectly synced with the visuals, creds to @Apple seriously good work.
Apple should make the iPhone Xi and make it exclusive to China. Re take the market @Apple
Shittt quiero el new iPhone jajaj @Apple y u do this
Fuck @apple and fuck @verizon
@Apple my friends iPhone was stolen in Mexico. Can you help?
Idk who @Apple thinks they are messing w/ my iphone just bc a new one is coming out pic.twitter.com/wm9Jxq2NmS
This is a question I've been asking myself a lot recently. @amazon @Google and @apple are such juggernauts, they can dominate every marketplace they set their sites on When is too much, too much ?
Fuck me up @Apple stream aiiyl pic.twitter.com/z7mFQqagul
@Apple staring with that slowing down my phone bullshit because that ugly ass 8 Xs was announced a few days ago.
Anyone else getting the scam @Apple support call about your #ICloud being breached? #Scam #Apple @AppleSupport
Great read from @michaelgrothaus of @FastCompany on how @Apple is upping their privacy features. https:// bit.ly/2Quwz8z
@Apple
@Apple I hate that when you make new products my apple products start moving slow. Like uhh
@Apple so are you eventually going to bring out a new I-pod or iPod nano again?
You can suck my c@ck @CoxComm you will lose more business the way you treat customers. Bravo @sprint @netflix @hulu @amazon @Apple ............ @ClarkCountyNV @lvchamber @CityOfLasVegas @8NewsNow @FOX5Vegas @VegasPBS @News3LV @KTNV #DropCox #CutCOX
I will hold on toy iPhone SE until @Apple getd back to its senses and resurrect it. Or maybe I'll go Android.
I'm at @Apple Millenia in Orlando, FL https://www. swarmapp.com/c/aRJ9UjiZl5O
Why did @Apple take away the Rose Gold color??
I always forget how bad the AirPods sound until I use real headphones... @Apple just make high quality AirPods and everyone will be happy.
@Apple 's #MacAppStore is becoming a problem. People have put trust in the company, and they need to make good on it. https:// buff.ly/2CXOB0s @DigitalTrends
Not selling as @Apple thought, usually all new iPhones are sold out for weeks after the first hour of going live on pre orders!
@apple I have the Note 9 if you're interested in having a look at it, just so you know what features you need to add to your 2020 iPhone models. I'm more than happy to help x
@Vyyyper nails it in this latest video. Heart health is a priority, especially for us men. So if you're on the fence, then don't be. When it comes to your health and heart... An @Apple watch today will keep the doctors away. https:// youtu.be/4h2MReaLo7Y
@Apple , how about donating to Red Cross in Puerto Rico? You can do better!
Lol @Apple thinking that they are innovating but they are just over pricing
@Apple @theapplehub @ATTWireless .. people like me who stayed up and pre-ordered yet our shipping dates are (Oct/Nov) but the people who will just stand in line will be able to buy the product next Friday in stores! Not fair! pre-orders should be fullfilled first!! Right??!
Find it quite laughable that @Apple said that the iPhone 8 was the most durable screen ever and mine and a friends screen broke stupidly and ridiculously easy
@Apple im not buying the iphone xs or 9 so if u can stop fucking with my phone so that i have to buy it that would be appreciated
You're a stan for @Apple
Hey @Apple Pluto is a planet again please add it to the Apple Watch #bringplutotoapplewatch
Which to buy: iPhone Xs vs iPhone Xs Max http:// bit.ly/2p7dnRO #iPhone #iPhoneXsMax #iPhoneXs #AppleEvent #Apple @Apple pic.twitter.com/lR5GwxOTsL
Viva el marketing - dijo @Apple .
@Apple what is the story behind name iphone X(R). What does R stand for?
Que bola fora em @Apple @MacMagazine @mvcmendes pic.twitter.com/ow3d7kkPYS
@Apple Please make a MacBook Pro that doesn't have a low profile keyboard. I would buy a new computer but I can't use the mac pro keyboards with my wrist problems.
YOU ALREADY KNOW @Apple #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/Gopb5DJv2g
fuck @apple new phones come out n mine starts acting up hmmmmm
I wish @TMobile will give us a new generation side kick @apple is headed downhill fast
Picked up my repaired MacBook Pro today. The process was very fast and efficient. Thanks . @Apple (Canada)! #FastRepair #AppleCare pic.twitter.com/RO0tPDiA1o
Way to go @Apple ! The company now runs all of its facilities on 100% #renewableenergy https:// buff.ly/2qjLxCg pic.twitter.com/5e2ZWYKjFf
i LOVE @Apple but i hate how expensive it is, I buy it any way but I am getting tired of this and then comes that feeling of desire for such amazing products; it's a never ending ride #EmotionalRollercoaster #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/wmQiIjwqHG
Done alread @Apple
I have exclusively only ever purchased @Apple products for my phone and computing needs, but the increasingly ludicrous and inaccessible prices of their products, combined with their unsustainable practice of planned obsolescence has got me feeling like an #AppleStrike is due
i swear @apple if you make my phone lag just because you released a new one im switching to LG
A special thank you to @akaxo , @akasorority1908 and @AKANARegion for supporting the National #HBCU Braintrust sponsored by @intel and @Apple #CBCFALC18 pic.twitter.com/v4vwQ8s16e
For some time I have been using Firefox Quantum. Quite stable speedy, even with lots of tabs open. Switched back to @Apple Safari on macOS Mojave beta, and boy it is like molasses! Four tabs open and it stutters and stalls, and the fans are spinning on my MacBook Pro 2016. #ux
Why #image button on my iPhone suddenly dissapear? @apple
@Apple @tim_cook Hi sir Tim. Perhaps the next Apple products could veer away from the minimalist design at least just 4 one product generation/a year and maybe be more like these church designs (perhaps embossed or carved) to further explore how sir Ive's and his team's prowess
@Apple wankers
Dear @Apple , Can you please make it so when I move my photos from my main album into sub-albums, they move out of the main album. Sincerely, A girl with OCD trying to organize her life
When your @apple watch reminds you to stand, you head for a piece of toffee! #winning
You're shipping a 5W charger with a $1000-$1200 phone? Come on @Apple @tim_cook

3/ Current alarm systems are following the old mechanical clock paradigm. They aren't re-imagined with software possibilities. After all, time trigger is but amsubset of the triggering possibilities of an Alarm. @android @Apple #DesignThinking
2/ Alarm can be hooked to Air time tables. Automatically alerting us at lounge or shopping in the airport prior to flight departure. Alarm reschedules itself on flight delays @android @Apple #designthinking
Thinking about trying @Apple MacBook Pro, sitting on a desk 20' ahead of me. Remote Desktop'd into it via @oculus Go headset, eventually Santa Cruz. And keyboard/mouse via @tapwithus . Over a @ubnt Unifi AC network.
@Apple can you DM me? I have an important question about your phone.
1/ The humble Alarm needs a make over. How about an alarm which rings before we reach a destination. Useful for long unpredictable cab, bus and train rides. Alarm hooked to #GPRS @android @apple #designthinking
@DetroitBORG What?! So @Apple lied and then kept quiet about it? Maybe they have something else planned instead?
My iPhone is glitching! Omg @apple !
Actually the tax cuts made thw 1% much richer. The middle class temp cut was not noticed on pay checks. We are now 1.5 TRILLION more in debt. The current GOP/trump proposed tax cut will add another 1.5 TRILLION more to our debt! @Apple hid 260 billion in cash offshore #DeficitDon pic.twitter.com/AsfU0uZYUJ
Obrigada @Apple por me deixares [muito] indecisa entre o 8 plus e o XR
@Eminem @Apple @iTunes pls put the MGK diss track on Apple Music thanks
Lies! @AppleSupport @AppStore @Apple pic.twitter.com/sg2Wd6QZvF
@Apple You would think that now we are at iOS 12, you would give us some new ring/text tones, I'm just saying.
I seriously need a FAN emoji!!! @Apple pic.twitter.com/Ga3K1JnKub
@Apple if the iPhone is so environmentally friendly why isnt solar powered and why do you have soldered ram, batteries & about 15 different types of torque screws.
This PC has been updating for 45 minutes and is only at 16%. Yet another reason why I will always choose @apple over @windows . pic.twitter.com/hkHiW4FigN
I love how @Apple advertises the "Liquid Retina" screen of the #iPhoneXr when it's just a shitty LCD
I know @Apple is expensive but they provide the best #experience possible. You need to pay a price for in this capitalist world and thats how all businesses are. People who mock at its pricing are not its target audience and #Apple knows why it sells high whatever the pricing be
Just replying to @Apple tweets saying how better @Samsung are
I would keep replying on @Apple tweets saying @Samsung is better
My phone is rare now, s/o to @apple
@Apple take notes
@Dyson , the @Apple of home care products, just with lower quality.
maybe @apple should try innovating in the smaller phone space for those of us who won't buy a huge phablet? instead they just dumped the se, the best phone they've made.
@Apple woooow how my system gonna take up 83 gigabytes of my storage tho? pic.twitter.com/MlwRE1cNXj
To my people out there, Yes @Apple is going amazing! Much love! See you all in a month! Schedule for Long hours!
The @Apple store bricked my iPhone 7 today and then asked me to pay $319 to get it fixed. @AppleSupport #sigh
Actually the best combo ever is @TMobile & @apple #bestnetwork #tmobilechangingthegame #someonesendmethenewiphome pic.twitter.com/grCakHJHvT
Hey @MacSparky , your Siri Shortcuts course is fantastic. I loved Workflow and I'm so glad @Apple didn't kill it and instead made it even better. I can hardly wait until Monday for the release of IOS 12. Thank you!
@Apple what does R stand for in iphoneX (R)
What @apple is doing for humanity
@Apple presenta su nuevo #iPhone y reloj inteligente y estas son las novedades que trae http:// bit.ly/2p2kZ8t pic.twitter.com/iSpOAlbK64
@Apple I have a recommendation. How would I be able present one?
Please I'm doing a give out ur old Phone challenge to every celebrity in Nigeria and globally @Apple has released a new and awesome iPhone and definitely celebs would be purchasing it so, instead of dumping your old devices to get the new one why no give it away? To random peps
Dear @Apple , I pre-ordered the XS Max in Gold and now I am stalking my order status and checking the mail every day pic.twitter.com/NMccsVoD3n
@Apple I noticed the images changed on the models in the iCloud section in Settings and the Find My iPhone app. I dig it. #ios12 #pleasegetheresoon
@Apple
Every time I'm in the dark trying to grab the right pair of my 2 identical @Apple EarPods that have 2 different connectors for my MacBook and iPhone I feel like I'm a victim of greedy corporate consumerism
The @apple TV remote is utterly shameful. Such a useless design for tv viewing that every app must invent its own controls, and none are actually effective because the remote is such a user-hostile device
@Apple because your recognition of Taiwan and Hong Kong I will now buy an iPhone.
Um, has anyone called out @Apple for naming their new $1K+ phone the XS Max? Does it count as trolling when it's that fucking obvious?
@Apple --here's an idea: first update to iOS 12 includes the ability to filter messages from Trump via FEMA.
If @Apple thinks I'm gonna spend 1,000 dollars in a phone they're damn right I am
Hi @Apple at this time of the year I normally get an email offering to schedule my new phone order (as I am on that payment plan). Who should I contact to make this arrangement? Mahalo~

@apple event happened 2 days ago and all of a sudden my phone is acting up. Just as predicted. pic.twitter.com/pVHsvBqwqx
segunda vez que tenho que trocar a tela de um @SamsungBrasil em menos de 2 meses. cara, se a sensibilidade da @apple for tao grande quanto a da tela do concorrente esse iphone sai
@Apple i hate the fact that i cant switch from FaceTime to regular phone but i can go from regular to FaceTime
How will @SamsungMobile respond to @Apple 's new releases.
