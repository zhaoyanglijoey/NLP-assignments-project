Curse you @Apple for making such a fragile screen
@apple I think itunes is a terribly slow and old app and sincerely you are apple so you can and should do better, I like your customer service though Melissa was nice to me the other day. P.S This is an angry tweet but its not far from the truth.
Hi @Apple please consider adding the sad cowboy emoji to the keyboard, thank u
Dear @apple , STOP FUCKIN UP MY FREAK NASTY MESSAGES -Sincerely, an IPhone user.
@apple needs to make an iTunes app where you can control it like the original iPods with the spin wheel.
@Apple you heard it from me first: we need a search bar for the emojis invest in me

Call me old fashioned but I like my phone with its 16:9 rectangular screen and fingerprint scanner, and a watch that relies on neither light emitting diodes nor lithium ions to tell me the date and the time. #luddite #courage #getoffmylawn @Apple
@Apple who wants to file a class action lawsuit against apple for false advertisement , quoting that the iPhone 7 and up I water resistant per 30 min time frame! Meaning a sweat nor water shouldn't asorb into your phone for that time since there's a resistant to protect the phone

I have to agree with this article from @TechCrunch . The new Macbook keyboard is horrible. Tying on it is inaccurate and it leave my hands hurting if I use it for more than 45 minutes. I have not issues with the old design or my Surface Book 2. @tim_cook needs to rethink @Apple .
give the aux jack back bro @apple

@Apple
@Apple If someone steals an iPad with out cellular data it should prompt to connect to wifi and then send out it's location.
@Apple sort your shit out
Bcoz of this arrogance by @apple treating the customer. I can proudly say @iFixit come to the rescue. And helping me out.
@tim_cook @apple Please add HomeKit categories coffee machines, robot vacuums and sirens - such obvious categories. Also allow speakers in scenes - why is this not possible now? Lastly allow colour changing light scenes (so they can rotate through colours at set speeds etc..)

#Advertising is about making an idea contagious, NOT THE PRODUCT. The idea is the brand. Not the product. Otherwise @Nike is a rubber shoe (whaaat), @Apple is a screen to touch (hooow) or @Tesla is a electrical socket car (whhhy) and @JimCarrey a big mouth funny guy (whooo?)

Well done to @amazon for becoming the world's second $1tn company after @Apple and to mark the occasion, how about you both pay your fucking tax bills. Cheers.
The fact that Final Cut Pro keeps crashing and lagging on my Mac Pro (you know, the computer it was designed for) is absolutely ridiculous. Also, it can barely handle 4K footage. @apple UPDATE YOUR SHIT.

@Nike @apple needs to ditch Nike and the Nike Apple Watch. I am changing running apps, and have several thousand miles logged with @NikeRunning . I will run more, just not logging miles with Nike. Stay out of politics. Taking a hammer to my Nike Apple Watch.
@Apple is there a reason you got rid of the headphone jack? The phone doesnt come with wireless headphones and i would love to be able to listen to my music-based phone while charging my music-based phone at the same time

I don't usually talk #tech on here, but folks, please keep your money when it comes to the new @Apple line of horseshit. $10,000 USD for what? NOTHING. Save about $2,000 in hard earned cash and get a motherload of a workstation with a bullet-proof 5-year warranty. @Alienware

Careful, @Apple , he's looking to bankrupt you.
Yes, @realDonaldTrump A US-made @Apple product will be good. But once Apple factors in labour costs, this device will cost thousands. Not likely to happen. But economics is clearly not your forte, sir.
Mr President we are willing to pay higher prices if it means @Apple moves operations back to the USA and stops sending our data to communist China (which is a national security risk!) #WeThePeople r with u @realDonaldTrump ! #QAnon #Wwg1wga #thegreatawakening #maga #walkaway
I don't disagree with most of those items--as for approachability, @Apple was similar when it started out (honestly still is more$ compared to its competitors), & they still have TONS of quality of life issues in their factories abroad, but you still use an iPhone, no?
Dammit @Apple . 10 min of simple texting, my battery drops from 98% to 30%! And then, without using the phone, notifications drops it to 14% in under 2 hrs. Time 2 spend my weekend at the Apple store to fix it. As owner of 7 Apple devices, this is infuriating #batterythrottling

When that New @Apple IPhone 10 plus comes out, im going to Pre-order it from @TMobile right away! Always staying with that #TeamMagenta .
Crazy to me that @Apple has not created a random playback for #photos perfect for parents who want to mix in the early years with the later years of their kids. Chronology becomes too cumbersome as kids get older.
