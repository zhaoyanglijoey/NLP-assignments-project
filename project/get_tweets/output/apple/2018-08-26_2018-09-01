@Apple why does your Apple maps app sucks so fucking bad !!!!
@Apple do you guys have any plans to update the Safari app? Like maybe change up the home screen?
Apple I have absolutely had it with your bullshit phone chargers that never work. They are made to break and are pieces of donkey shit. Thanks for making today great. @Apple

good attempt, you forgot to tag your stove brand and the device you sent this tweet from. Sent from my @Apple iPhone 6.
The Android Messages quick replies are becoming more contextual and fluid every day. (Thanks @Google ) @messenger does a really good job with these too. Question: does iMessage have these? If not, I'd bet we see @Apple "launch" something like it at WWDC to crazed fanhood pic.twitter.com/7c5jcdxXjS
@Apple really is the champion of unwanted features. My iPhone has started alerting me to the traffic conditions to my next meeting. I didn't ask for this. I don't want it. And I'm not driving there. #internetofshit
I have to hand it to @apple - as much as a whine about a lot of their products, the iMac Pro is an exceptional machine. It's my workhorse and gaming machine via dual-boot, works well with both.

I hope Apple should also include apple's music sharing via Instagram stories so there's no need for us to take a screenshot of the song we're currently playing. But I sooo love the built-in full lyrics of the song. Gujab! @Apple @AppleMusic

No 1 forces you to buy anything if that is your mindset then i feel sorry for u. Make it slow, bendgate blah blah blah.. @Apple are the kings of quality.. I will give my money anyday cos i know what im getting i know the quality and i will pay with a appke any day boy!!
I believe @Apple have some in their shops if I'm not mistaken. I was taking to @Amy_Lee_20 about them the other day
Is it just me that spends 10 minutes every day trying to get the @Apple AirPods to connect?

@Apple CUT THE FCKN SHIT with this Maybe: ********* I DELETED THE CONTACT FOR A REASON !!!
I've decided not to buy @Apple again. I wasn't given tech service to repair my computer, not to reeplace the phone battery, and wasn't even given originals when Made For iPhone cables failed. In a search of a more supportive less dispossable brand. Hearing @lenovo could be one.
. @Apple is now blocking its gay pride watch face in Russia. https:// hypb.st/w1a7d
@apple need to get right
And as much as I miss the slightly quicker #AutoCorrect , I don't think I'll be returning to #iOS unless @Apple drastically reduce their costs. I'll keep the laptop but not the phone.
@UnboxTherapy i wouldn't invite you either if i was @Apple .To bad to sad @Apple products dont overheat,crash, get viruses its not the best in certain expects but its better then alot of the others out therei have apple products running 5-6 years without an issue or repair needed

@Apple You should really consider making Apple Music a web-standard site so people can log in and listen to their music on different platforms other than a Mac/PC or other iOS devices...it would certainly be more intuitive, especially if people are paying for their subscription.
@Apple If you are going to launch your streaming service you will need a "boss car" show that will get people interested in your platform. How about considering the Shadowhunters a fourth season, it has a powerful and madly passionate fandom #SaveShadowhunters

@Apple you sold us a defective phone and now refuse to fix the phone per Barry at the north brook Illinois store because 17 year old went by herself to have it fixed. The tech plugged her phone up, now she can't even use Wi-Fi. Fix the defective product you put on the market.
