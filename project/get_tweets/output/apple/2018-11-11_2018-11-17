@Apple @AppleSupport Will there be a software update that enables USB-A to USB-C, with or without your adaptor, for the new iPad Pro 11 inch? I can't sync my brand spanking new iPad Pro to my 2012 MacBook Pro because it's too old to have Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C ports...

@Timcook freaking liar! Every update screwed our phones and computer labtop and NO help from unprofessional staff of him and people watcha for ur card that we been forced to put on iTunes bs before u k ur credit card or debit card beetused multiple times and no help @Apple thief
There definitely needs to be files/folders and keyboard/mouse support on the @Apple #iPad , I think they have strongly resisted it because then it becomes a #MacBook challenger, especially the #iPadPro . But clearly with more powerful devices, even #iPhone can do more. @reneritchie

@Apple @tim_cook how's that my iPhone can only hold charge for 2 hours less than 2 years after it was replaced for warranty! I know about programmed obsolescence but this is ridiculous! With the prices on the new models it's impossible to get a new one! Am I moving to Android?

You know its interesting, I don't understand why @Apple limits Siri on their computers. Like setting alarms & setting timers. ):

What's bizarre about your reporting @CNBCFastMoney is how you talk about China trade/intelprop war fixing Chips? Maybe for investors but not for anyone who owns devices made since 1997. This is the most underreported story in tech history. @Apple TimCook's privacy concerns valid.
I stopped at @Apple store to look at new iPad Pro very nice but $1700 is over priced so I will skip this one also passing on new iPhone for $1400.

@tim_cook @Apple are going to be way behind the eight-ball, if they are waiting for Intel to be ready by 2020 to start iPhone production etc, as @Telstra has already started to deploy 5G across Australia & have tested mobile speeds of at least 3Gbps/300Mbps via mmWave etc.

I really find @Microsoft to be the dumbest Corporation ever. Updates are daily endless updates. For a software company I find there software inferior to @Apple in every way. There not doing updates every day to fix there messed up software because it is perfect.
. @Apple oh so it's"pay-to-win" now? This is clearly not prioritising your users.

You might be right. On the other hand, @apple is a cash machine. At this rate, they could take themselves private inside 20 years buying all outstanding shares.
So the last few weeks I've been struggling with my MacBook laptop, since installing Mojave. While a number of websites no longer work on Chrome, they do on Safari... which is generally an inferior browser, but made by @apple . Coincidence?

@Apple thank you to the great staff at your store in Waterloo, ON today. I was in and out in 15 min with exactly what I needed. They made a huge difference in my day. #amazingservice
Dear @moogmusicinc and @Apple when the user scrolls up and down your store page should not scroll side to side, this is like basic user interface 101 shit
Please don't use @Apple they refuse to allow 3rd parties to fix products they no longer fix, also they lie to customer as rossmann showed, plus try to over charge for parts like linustechtips, go to android and you will have no issues with repairs or bad service
my phone isnt even a year old and it wont turn on,,,,,, riiiight @Apple
My phone was working perfectly until i ignored the iOS update notification a certain amount of times. It would be a shame for @Apple to have to deal with another lawsuit

Anyone else surprised that the new @Apple MacBook Air doesn't have FaceID? They have the technology, and if they can fit it in a phone, why not a laptop?
It's scary how many businesses are producing stuff that doesn't last... and we, the consumers, let them get away with it. It's time to push back @Apple and others that do this and demand better. Clothing, homewares, furniture, technology... Let's make less stuff that lasts.

@apple @tim_cook - Where is my Macbook? Its being repaired and NO ONE can tell me how long its going to take!! I work from my Mac and leaving the country in 4 days! WTF!! I just want to cancel the repair and your call center is telling me i cant! Apple customer service is.......
Go figure. @Apple has known about the issue and still does nothing. https:// discussions.apple.com/thread/8607065 #fixit
Since @apple got away with selling the same iPhone X just in different sizes & colors! Everyone in world bought it so expect the same iPhones next year & every year also 5 of the same iPhones Y just in 1 year. Charge $5000 for each iPhone Y next year with a life time contract!
Fuck @Apple !!! I changed over my iPhone to a droid! Changing my laptop soon, too! I'm not stupid, only than buying their in the first place

Why is @coinbase @CoinbaseSupport @AppleSupport @apple Why is Coinbase apps still burning up my iPhone and using up the battery when I hardly use the app vs. other apps. Also, why and how is Coinbase, the only app that is performing iOS system services ?? pic.twitter.com/65VCjaOTLV
Is there any chance for me to get a job at @Apple ?
I was eating noodles and it was hot so my glasses fogged up and the face id still worked @Apple i love you
Hey @Apple , you might want to look in to the ability for the Windows iCloud app to sync bookmarks with Microsoft Edge. Internet Explorer is going away, and Edge is not one of the browser options for bookmark syncing. #FYI
Had a great time showing Clips to my real estate agent friends at Keller Williams Lakeside. We used Clips to create open house and listing videos. @AppleEDU #EveryoneCanCreate @kwri @Apple #clips pic.twitter.com/1XaaXqw09B
So far I can definitely say that iPhoneXR has a fantastic battery. I hope it stays that way. @Apple ...at that moment I think...upgrading was the best decision I made
You have got to be kidding me @Apple . @MyLove installed 12.1 and a logic board fried, now I have to pay for your mistake?!? #fixitright
But when are we getting a hoodie emoji @apple
@apple we need to be able to combine imessage effects pls

The biggest failure of #FaceID is the inability to match with a N95 Mask. @Apple I think we need #TouchID back.
I'm looking forward to the @Apple @bandai Pippin classic mini. I bet they could fit the entire game library on it! #classic #RetroGaming #perfectchristmasgift pic.twitter.com/AdccV2W6Eq

@Apple Why does the MacBook Air (2018) weigh over a quarter of a kilo more than the MacBook (2017)? What do your product lines even mean.
Ok the new iPhone XR battery is insane. The fact that I can heavily use it throughout the day and still be at 60-70% in the evenings is mind blowing. @Apple you have really knocked it out of the park on this one and I am in love. Upgrading was the best decision I made.
Not addressing issues or quickly releasing products that have severe problems or have been rushed to the market. Look at @Apple , with their bendable new iPad Pro, and how buggy iOS 12 has been. Look at @Android , making sure Google services only work there and not other devices
Really simple user epic for you @Apple : As a user I want to sync tagging of favorites so that I can easily find photos I have favorited on my iPhone when I'm on my Mac.
Hey @Apple can you make it a thing where if people have to wait over half an hour at the Genius Bar you give them free apple juice
@Apple make a feature so I can change all my emojis skin colors all at once instead of going one bye one... k thx for your time
a bateria do meu celular ta PODRE . vcs estao lendo isso @Apple ? yes .
@Apple @AppleMusic @AppleSupport can we please return to the full screen of album artwork when our phones are locked and music is playing? Please and thank you.
I'll admit @AdobePremiere on MacOS glitches and doesn't run as smooth as it probably could overall but I love what it is capable of for editing. @Adobe PLEASE improve the stability of Premiere Pro on @apple computers Thank You (from a die hard Adobe suite owner who uses Mac) pic.twitter.com/E9jrZnNpu2

@Apple thanks for being worlds ahead of @Google with your #map satellite imagery. Images are much more recent and much better quality
I wish there would be a way to tell @Apple that I can't read Thai script, even if I live in this country. Huge portion of us immigrants in this country can't. Localisation can be a good thing, but please don't force us to it. pic.twitter.com/CPwqMvIy0m
A special message for @apple . Do you guys know that preferred @AppleMusic partners refuse to work with #classicalmusic ? They afraid penalties from you dear @apple . This system creates barriers & unequal access to @AppleMusic for labels. #TechNews @CNETNews @DigitalTrends
I really want to get a MacBook Pro @Apple
Is @Apple #iOS 12 crippling millions of text replacements a #softwaredevelopment #quality fail bug or deliberate terrible #UX #CX #design decision? Long working shortcuts now fail if over about 2 lines of text. Why! #CustomerExperience #UserExperience
I think I will be switching back to @Apple Because I cant deal with this Galaxy Note 9 literally still brand new and my camera is not working like it suppose to bad idea I switched ....... bye @SamsungMobile
an @Apple Apple TV (4th Generation) - 64 GB: it cannot connect to networks any more; an 8 port ethernet switch the Apple TV was connected to.
@Apple can we please get an apple pay ATM?
Why does @apple lock my account when I use the right password. Hopeless.
my battery life on iphone 6+ is getting worst and drain faster after i upgraded to ios 12.1 fix it @Apple
Hey . @elonmusk , since the V9 update has killed Spotify one day after I got my new Model S, do you think the fix might also include allowing my ipod to work too? Simple enough to allow it to send music via USB? Infinite Loop only 11 miles away, sure they'd be happy to help! @Apple
Start selling your Iphone XR on 499$ #MyAdvice @Apple @AppleSupport .
