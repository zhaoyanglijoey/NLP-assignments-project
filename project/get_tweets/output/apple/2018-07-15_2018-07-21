Then she told me there was nothing else she could do today anyway, since even if I paid $299, it would take 2 days for them to open my phone and check things out (even though service was not possible??!!) and then told me the appointment was now over. Worst @Apple experience ever
@Apple thanks to the people at the Knoxville mall for replacing my #iphone8plus . I was having issues with 11.4.1, now I have 11.2.1. No issues @AppleSupport
If I had to buy a new computer today, I still wouldn't get the new @Apple Mac Book Pro. I refuse to buy into that touch bar. I would give the keyboard a try though.

I wish I could get a refund on the thousands of dollars I have spend on @Apple products through the years for myself and as gifts for others. Makes me sick that I have been waiting he for a higher manager to call and they never did. #FahQApple You have lost a lifelong customer
@Apple was my favorite supplier of electrical devices until today when they were so rude to me and I waited in line at their store at the Mall Of America and was treated so bad. I have never been so insulted and ever worse is that the people at #Apple were lying and they know it.

Maybe we should have made the switch to @SamsungMobileUS years ago. @Apple @AppleSupport is awful. They take your money and give you nothing. And they do not have ability to replace phone less than 90 days old.
So we own an iPhone X for less than 90 days and it becomes unresponsive. After giving my credit card info and spending 5 + hours on the phone, it is on backorder so we have no phone and none for weeks. Apple your service is awful. @AppleSupport @Apple @verizon

@Apple we need a variety of fonts on the iPhone.
So apparently @Apple in their latest update 11.2 has put in software that prevents you from using 3rd party usb lightning cables. I was able to use 3rd party cables @AnkerOfficial brand which are just a little cheaper than Apples when the phone was on OS10.
Another day of #abuse by @Apple and @AppleSupport I jumped through the hoops they asked me to and instead of helping me they extended the lock out on the iPhone by two days. If they stick to their word, which so far they just keep refusing to, lock out will be at least 18 days

To all @apple users please stop with apple exclusive emojis in your name. All boxes with Xs in them dont mean a thing to android users.
Why don't @Apple design something that fits the current aesthetic or keep the old building? Probably because they want to stand out and make a LOOK AT ME statment. Is that what we want in our shared, common public space?
I can't even figure out how to cancel iTunes. Had to google it. LOL @Apple is a giant racket. ALL subscriptions canceled. Trading my iPhone X in soonl. Giant piece of garbage. Aaaand TrueDepth camera crapped out. Store wouldn't honor my appointment. No return call f/ Cupertino.
@areitz any advice here? I wanna wake up at different times on different days, forgive me @Apple !

Dear @Apple , Ever since updating my iPhone 6s to iOS 11.4.1, I have been unable to sustain a consistent, reliable connection to my Wi-Fi network. When will you fix this?
Look like a great tool. Also, you guys are years behind @Apple when it comes to promo videos. My 12 year old son could do better.
