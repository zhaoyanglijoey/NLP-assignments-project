And tonight I have 3 suns on the horizon. @apple should have done a better job on the lens flare on the Xs. Unfortunately it looks like a hardware issue and something a software patch can fix. pic.twitter.com/CGuSiWSNpc
@Apple Is it possible to have a future ios update where we can shrink our wallpapers even smaller so larger pictures can fit the lockscreen and home screen properly?

Why does my brand new iPhone XS not support 5G? WTF @apple you should be ahead of the curve.
@Apple @AppleSupport I drive a semi truck all around the country. You should install a logger on my iPhone XSM and track my LTE connection. It drops all the time even when my iPad Pro still has a connection.
@Apple - Hi. Thinking of buying an apple laptop. Will there be any sales on Black Friday?
@apple sucks dick hole
For fuck sake. I now have 0/4 functional computers thanks @apple and @microsoft .
So after a few hiccups dealing with @Apple customer service. One of the managers called me back today and apologized and is covering the replacement. Wish it wasn't so much work. But I appreciate she stepped up and was sympathetic to the situation.

@Apple sucks. I'll never buy another Apple product. Ever. I get that some people want to have the latest phone, but others (like myself) want the phone to last after paying more just to get an Apple product that turns out to be crap.
@apple the latest #iOSupdate is #bad . I WANT my phone on silent & I don't need your dumb notification constantly telling me it's on silent. And rarely would I want to open up my camera thru Messages app; please bring back the convenient way of texting photos from camera roll!

@Apple PLEASE fix FaceTime. The camera flip button needs to be accessible quickly and not buried

Dear @Apple , if you really want developers to notarize their Mac apps, start by creating a better workflow!
The only people who still use iPhones are the people who don't know any better. They're this generation's Blackberry owner. There are so many great @Android phones that @Apple can no longer seriously stand up to comparison.
