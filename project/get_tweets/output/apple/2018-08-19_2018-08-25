@Apple "It didn't affect any customers" ... Suuure! ... Only the celebrities with naked selfies. Typical of a Mega-Tech company to deny, deny, deny, then plead forgiveness and say "We've taken steps to make sure it will never happen again". #BlahBlahBlah #thefappening
@Apple has this retail thing nailed down. Their App Store app actually knows if you're near an Apple store. Which is kind of creepy. Today I had to get an iPad charger so I just picked it up from the shelf, scanned it & paid for it via their app & I was out of the store.

@Apple why did my screen just pop off of my iWatch?!?! pic.twitter.com/1kTG4bFfBQ
Can we be honest? @Apple iPhones are the worst and least reliable product in almost any market. Had a screen protector for over a year, 3 days and a smashed screen. These phones are the worst.
It's the year of our lord 2018 and @apple still hasn't figured out a better notification system than "scroll through every single notification and dismiss it"

@Apple I phones should have a "toddler mode". You should be able to put your phone in this mode when your toddlers grab it and starts pressing buttons. It should prevent them from accidentally dialing 911, spending money, and maybe give them some pretty colors and sounds.
Because @Apple sucks
Congratulation to the most awful customer service of @Apple @AppleSupport in the Apple Store of La Canada Marbella. Spent 1 hour to retrieve a phone I have put for repair, no one in the technical service, they busy inside celebrating a birthday instead of taking care of customers

Is it a complete meeting and calling solution for @Apple users using the #Safari browser?
Wow. I never thought this day would come, but I am absolutely through with @apple and my Apple Watch. @AppleSupport made an appointment for me at @applestores at MOA for a watch replacement, but the store refused to do the exchange.
Everyone give me a love heart to have and to hold since @Apple & @tim_cook did not... I'm an unmasked salesman..
Your autocorrect is ass @Apple
First up: iOS weather app. This is what started this whole deep dive. I'm completely shocked to learn that while the island I'm living on is currently under a Hurricane Watch the @apple weather app shows literally 0 information about it. Based on this app the weather is all good. pic.twitter.com/WtEyCEEkIt
Also, @AppleSupport @apple will lose me as a customer over this. Disappointing to pay a premium for a product because of access to service and then have such difficulty arranging prompt and convenient service.
@Apple your phones would be way cooler if I could fucking listen to music and charge my phone
No @Apple how about a straight no. None of your 'oh you may well come along to our way of thinking later' crap. Just an option to just say no. pic.twitter.com/8S1saaF2AV
Oh. So @Apple iOS11 requires an Apple ID to work, no option to skip. Yet another piece unwarranted intrusion. Shame.
When did @apple stop letting you buy music on your phone? Apple Music subscription or GTFO? :( @trent_reznor pic.twitter.com/baYfjcCVnZ
@Apple resolve isso

Holy crap, I've realised some day I'll have to choose between the @AmazonUK or @GoogleUK infantry. While @MicrosoftUK watches from the bench muttering about that damn @Apple punk

I said @Samsung 's face recognition was as good as @Apple 's. Then I took my glasses off and my phone didn't recognize my face.

I thought upgrading my phone would do the trick. Yet again, my Galaxy S7 isn't receiving calls. Happened with my S6 also. Sorry @Android , I am making the move to @Apple at my next upgrade.
The more I learn about this new client of ours, the more impressed I become ... Client Service NPS score of +86 ... that's exceeds the likes of @Google & @Apple ... might be a camp worth exploring if a career change is on your horizon.
@mxssein did you know that @ASUS recently replaced the touchpad on the #zenbook with a screen pad, how cool can that get? Don't even know why it wasn't as hipped as the lame touch panel on @Apple CrapBooks..

@Apple One question, when are you going to re-sign ios 14.4 so people who are stuck with 14.4.1 update and now have no wi-fi can actually use your products by downgrading. Billion $ company but cant fix an abvious problem, or even acknowlege one......
