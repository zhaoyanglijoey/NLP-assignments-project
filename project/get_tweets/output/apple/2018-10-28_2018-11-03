@Apple Thank you for all the great products and features. Still waiting for your response to the case - 20000011527681. Request mail was shared with Apple Executives on 24-10-2018. Sorry to feel let down and no response till date.
Is @Apple #icloud for Macbook STILL DOWN? @AppleSupport It's been 5 days.
I literally havent even used my phone in 2 hours and it dropped 30% excuse me????? @apple
Dear @Apple ... we spend $1000 of dollars on these iphones an I have yet to have a charger cord that last an entire year this is what the next big announcement should be a better charging cord #PleaseAndThankYou
Here's an idea for @apple : instead of your watch reminding me to stand up every hour, how about reminding people do to Kegal exercises?
Goodbye @Google and Android Hello @Apple #iPhoneXS After years of staying away from Apples ecosystem, hopelessly waiting for #WindowsPhone and tolerating Android, finally took the plunge. 1 month into using the latest phone and so far I am loving it. Detail review soon.
@Apple
My Macbook needed some repairs, so I took it to apple store. They told me 10 days and it will be done. 11 days passed and nothing. I called the store and they tell me to call next week to see when could I pick it up (1) @Apple @AppleSupport
Was it only me that was so confused on what the R in #iPhoneXR stood for? I just watched the commercial for the phone and it suddenly came to me that the R stand ps for Rainbow!!! @ijustine @Apple @techinsider
@Apple me patrocina
I keep checking the @Apple News app in the hopes that the stupid space wasting sidebar has been removed... nope . Back to Google News.
when will i be able to leave a video message for the mfers that dont answer my facetime ?? @apple
It'a amazing how @Apple could have released this product to the public.

I'm at @Apple Century City in Los Angeles, CA https://www. swarmapp.com/c/0cjJf9y05se
Had a ThinkPad 600E & RedHat of course on the Linux side of things ruled. All that's online on how IBM was then compared to @Apple MacBooks. Old news. Long time coming. Even had a friend who used to preach about this RedHat support from the "big blue"...
Seriously, @Apple ... What the hell happens with last #iPhone and Wifi?
Dear Apple, I hope your next store will be in Kuwait! @Apple @tim_cook

Here are 7 things you should know about @Apple 's new iPhone XR before upgrading from an older iPhone. http:// bit.ly/2zclVeO #iPhoneXR #Apple $ AAPL
@Apple #shotoniphone pic.twitter.com/pZFTye1sMR
@TMobileHelp Customer for 10yrs/iPhone 7+ x2, opened a 1/2 dozen trouble tix since Aug, got 3 warranty replcmnts 2 new SIMS, 2 @apple visits Have signal booster. STILL HAVING SAME ISSUES & WORSENING 1 bar even on wifi, internet is slow Audio is garbled/cant hear/drop calls [1/2]
@Apple is a bully they have ripped off many companies on their way up to where they are today
Well done @Apple - your upgrade to #Mojave has killed the Android File Transfer app. So is this a fiendish plan to coerce Android users to use IOS or are you just plainly incompetent?
@intel @Apple @AppleTV @UNWebTV @Cabinet @IntelSoftware @5GRecruiter @rodrigodsdev @AlexHorovitz @TIME @Asma_Jahangir @SRWatSan @UNESCO @UN_SPExperts @LawLibCongress @LSEnews @kingsthings @KingSalman @HRHPSAUDS @khalidbinhamad @susandpage @MaggieFick @CQualtro @carlbildt @WFP
before @Apple goes under after being exposed for the consumer fraud they perpetrate on their "followers"... someone should find and expose the hallucinogen they've applied to their keyboard mouse and touch displays :-p
Thanks for the heads up bud, I think both @VodafoneUK and @Apple should have been more organised for the launch knowing it was going to be a hot gadget on release
What iPhones will @Apple be able to make if there already the best iPhones like the xs and max and Xr and the largest, how will they be able to make barter iPhones in the future.
Po upgradu na Mojave mi za den a pul zaklapnuteho macbooku (bez pouzivani) zmizi 60% baterky. To je dost na hovno @Apple

@Apple re: your latest adverts. Not only are they a bit rubbish, imo they don't encompass real life but Samsung have been doing that with their watch for some time now. Step it up. You must be able to employ a better marketing team, surely.

@Apple so you going to make that new iPad Pro with the thin bezel that is the same size all around the display, Face ID, and no headphone jack. Because that would be my dream iPad.
Phone brands that I respect for build quality, performance and longevity.. @essential @oneplus @nokia @Apple gets a midgrade for longevity @SamsungMobileUS and @LGUSAMobile also get a midgrade for awesome hardware but not for updates and longevity. #mylistofphones

@Apple 's FaceID is great. Now it frustrates me to look at my iMac or my Macbook Pro and not have it automatically recognize me. Can't wait to eliminate more passwords from my life.
@Apple is a little frustrating right now. My iphone has been continuously restarting since Saturday while I was out of town. I was told to make the hour round trip drive to the Apple store to get it fixed. I get there and am told to make an appointment for next week. (1/2)
Who's going to the Apple event tomorrow? #AppleEvent @Apple
@Apple when am I going to be able to leave FaceTime voice mails???
@Apple now that we all have fancy Bluetooth headphones, when will I be able to seamlessly re-pair from my phone to my MBP? Or phone to watch? Etc. Nuisance isn't your style!

@Apple are you insane? $1,400 for 64gb of 2666mhz RAM? Superior @CORSAIR RAM is cheaper.

Very hard to support such an anti-consumer company like @Apple $ AAPL . After many years of waiting, the new Macbook Air is a total flop. Overpriced, performance and feature poor. Complete exploitation of the naive/loyal who are willing to part w their money. Bezel still too thick

well @apple , @AppleSupport is now in the same regard of the rest of the biggest companies where customer concerns are no longer heard. Told the entire story to 5 people no one will see problems through. I remember when #apple and focus was on the customer pic.twitter.com/ZicqpNIy0X
Fuck @apple my iPhone 7 works like a fucking fossil
The icing on this INSULT CAKE is that the @Apple EDU pricing for HED is ONLY $30 AUD less. pic.twitter.com/EoOSGMeyv9
I need this new @apple iPad Pro for when I start ministering regularly again in the church. @AppleSupport
Here are some of the pictures @Apple shared yesterday as part of the new iPad Pro announcement. Super proud to be part of it. Big thanks to @AestheticaMag ! #chroma pic.twitter.com/I0Jl9pCPt1
$320 AUD to take a Mac mini SSD from 128GB to 256GB IS A JOKE. And it's INSULTING that it ships with an Intel i3 for $1250 AUD (base model). Dell do an 8th Gen i5 for $900 AUD with 128GB SDD + 1TB HDD @Apple - YOU REALLY ARE DELUDED. pic.twitter.com/9nyEgsE3rS

HAPPY BDAY TIM COOK @tim_cook ! And congrats on a great event on the 30th! @Apple
@Apple jumped 1.5% in regular trade ahead of its results, but dived 6.4% in after-market action as iPhone sales fell short of forecasts and its guidance disappointed.
@Apple suuuuper excited about the new ginger emoji and all buttttttt, y no sassy ging too??
why do your trash ass headphones stop working after like 3 months @apple
@Apple Why do not I have the option of video in the camera of my Iphone 8?
The new Retina-enabled #MacBookAir , the UFO #MacMini , and the edge-to-edge #iPadPro make up one of the most impressive Apple line-ups to date. Thanks @tim_cook and everyone at @Apple for boldly going where no man has gone before, and a special shout-out to @LanaDelRey ! pic.twitter.com/lL3BBCfamV
You have to look at that chart with a couple more hundred years on it Eh @Microsoft @Apple @GoogleAI @IBMWatson ....& look at how @NYSE and @federalreserve Manipulating Banking Systen & gold reserves ,the poor pay the same 4 a speeding ticket as the rich &Taxes ;) @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/2ox3qTN1W9

I know it is not fair to compare, but @Apple and @tim_cook needs to buck up with their innovations. Apple events used to be a time where everyone sits at the edge of their seats to see what Apple has to offer, but now I can't be bothered to even watch the live event.
@Apple if I want to exchange a new iPad Pro, for the newes, coolest iPad Pro, who do I need to talk to at the store.

Wow @JohnLegere wat amazing man . I wish u would of help me to pls my daughter iPhone 7 stopped working for no apparent reason yet to get help from @Apple getting run around, in the mean time since Monday we had lockout we had treat we had shooting in this desert Wojtyla help???
Stock markets are full of animals, who lack any sort of decency in investments. @Apple reported record revenues and @nextofficial reported greater sales than last yr and maintained full yr profit projections. Yet both had share price slumps of several points. #lunacy
@Apple love the new emojis now can you please make solar system ones

Ah bon bah je ne savais pas ^^ Au pire comme dirait @Apple , AirPort :P
I have an idea, let's name our flagship new BIG iPhone XS... because nothing says BIG like Xtra Small. Oh & while we're at it, let's give it 2 sizes. Of course that means people think XR is the big size? What, it's another phone completely? @apple failed sooo, sooo hard.
just updated my ios and im sad to say @apple hasnt added a DAB EMOJI very sad
Correction: We exposed 32 scam apps and @Apple removed only 23 of them. 9 of them are still live on @Appstore
@Apple thank you for Group FaceTime. In your next update can you please add a NINJA emoji. Thank you.
@applepayfordummies #NameOnIt #ClaimedIt @Apple your not as fucked proof as you thought. Your not going to use me and not pay. WTF you got me twisted with a crack bitch sucking dicks.

wtf, new @Apple A12X Geekbench score for LLVM is faster than my new Macbook Pro 2018 with 6 core i7. (3.24kFunction/s vs 3.2kFuncion/s). @Intel , you are in trouble.
Is @Apple the largest cloud services company by revenue? $10b this quarter..
@apple fucked me over
There are two *co-primary* endpoints (oh noes! a certain KOL says this is a bad thing... will he trash the @Apple Heart Study?)
No its linked to their poor pricing, focusing on trying to stay a trillion dollar stock market king, instead of supporting their customers who got them there. @Apple is beginning to disappoint me as the Management Team lead by @tim_cook seems to be focusing more on more on $$$
@Apple bring back FaceTime photos for the sake of me
Applause @apple for the new iPads. Nicely done.
@Apple my ip xs max is overheating and battery drain so fastttt!!!!
Ya right. and @BlackBerry was once literally called the CRACKberry. Reason for the @Apple discount was and always will be the risk of a missed product cycle. Their service revenue is key to mitigate it. So far street still doesnt buy that story. Seitching costs r low.
Dear @Apple thank you so much for releasing the emoji, my boyfriend will never see the end of it now

Hi @Apple ! Thanks for the Mojave update on MacBook esp the dark mode. Everything is better in dark mode. :)
Apple products growth Q2-2017 Vs. Q2-2018 Iphone sales growth 0% Mac sales growth - 2% Ipad sales growth - 6% Sales are declining yet the revenue of @Apple is increasing due to increasing the price of the products
My favorite part about @apple is that they smile when they fuck us. #eatmydongle #humble

@Apple I would happily pay 2% more at restaurants for simplicity of #ApplePay .

@Apple I purchased iPhone XS on Oct 17 2018. It crashes many times by opening Safari even after updateing iOS 12.1. Some other apps do the same. Please take care of this problem. Thanks
