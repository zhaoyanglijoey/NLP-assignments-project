Lol. Well there are tons of free tutorials out there, but if you ever do get a chance to take a class at any kind of school (check local community college also) I highly suggest it. I think even @Apple stores have free classes in FCP every so often, they're usually full though.
... @MesutOzil1088 can I have your @Apple Airpods plz?
i think @Apple just took like half of my photo gallery and i have no idea on how to restore it

Dear @Apple - please design your next #iPhone with users in mind. time to get rid of lightning and switch to USB-C to make life easier with our MacBooks... or am I just not cool enough to be an apple customer anymore?
@tim_cook Stop resting in your laurels and get your motivation back. Competition is passing @apple and your sales are showing that. Hope 2019 is the year you expand the iPhone design. #TeamiPhone
i hate you @apple
Mannn @Apple give us a way to mass delete our contacts already sheesh
@apple
The @Apple website says "pickup in store today!" but you get there and they say "probably not ready today..."
@Apple next iPhone - able to blow on the screen to get rid of notifications
@Apple I feel as if Apple stole $100 from me! This company, as powerful as it is, does not have employees that can handle situations that are not in the scritp. A lot are very ill prepared, they just want to sell, make a full of you, then let the ball roll over.
@Apple Why our phone batteries suck? :(
Congrats. The Apple Watch has also changed my life. I feel so energetic and staying active everyday. Thanks @tim_cook and @Apple team.

Here's a clue @Apple . Let your software run on PCs, Android phones and tablets and support it as well. This would spread your apps and services business. The time to be closed minded is over. Your hardware isn't the best on the market.
Listen @Apple , the airdrop feature is the most awesomest thing ever. It makes me smile ear to ear!

@Apple It's just getting obvious with the updates slowing down our machines to make us purchase new ones. Was forced to update both my mac and iPhone. Both at the same time running less effectively. Significantly and blatantly slowing down workflow. Come on.

Microsoft more valuable than @Apple ? My new MacBook shows why. No HDMI. No Thunderbolt. No USB. No magnetic power connector. No SD slot. Not allowed to use same password for account. Etc etc. On which planet is ANY of this convenient? Apple used to work FOR us, not AGAINST us.
Aye @apple thank you for creating the block button. You honestly work WONDERS!!!!

They sure are. With the high cost of products & support svc I would think @apple would at least have the professionalism to respond to online complaints. Strange that they sent me a survey to rate their service. Their size has led to arrogance and disregard for customers.

Everything except font rendering. @Apple f***ed it up with Mojave. Grayscale rasterization instead of RGB antialiasing really degrades the experience for me, even in Retina. Right now, Ubuntu with FreeType has the best font rendering in the market.
