@Apple IPhone El Dispositivo mas #Sobrevalorado
Lately, been having trouble with @Apple #Siri and #HomePod . I ask it to play a list and it starts playing and then just stops after a song or half way. The Wifi signal is strong. Maybe the latest update is the culprit? Anyone else having issues?
@Apple put the damn fast charging wall adaptor in the box! And the #airpods too for that matter!! OnePlus 6T - Unboxing And First Impressions https:// youtu.be/0EnfjHYRpfQ via @YouTube @Flossycarter @oneplus that is how you do it!!!!
@AppleSupport @Apple WORST customer service EVER! Promises not kept, completely disrespectful and dishonest!

can you please bring 3d touch back on the keyboard and the private navigation please @Apple
With the current line up, @apple should start Mac Upgrade Program. Cc: @pschiller @tim_cook
@Apple can you stop slowing down all the older iPhones with every update. Thanks.
@apple should have released colorful Smart Keyboards. I got the standard black one, but the Surfaces look so cool with their colorful ones. :/ oh well.
Finally @Apple made this emoji

I wish @Apple made headphone that fit my ears
lemme get air charge @Apple
@Apple how do i stop this screen time mess?
I gotta say. airpower would have been a slam dunk for @apple this holiday quarter. it would add to an already fantastic lineup. Homepod's first holiday qtr, AirPods (already selling insanely well), new Apple Watch series 4, slick new iPad pros, mainstream Xr, and great new Macs.
Here are some photos I took of my nephews birthday using my @Apple IPhone X, shout out to @tim_cook and the rest of the awesome people at Apple. Love the camera on it; pic.twitter.com/H6DR67cw2x

Am I the only one getting Apple's iPhone adds here. @Apple I am not ready to switch. Thank you
Who uses iCloud. @apple need to stop with that nonsense kmt.
@tim_cook @Apple Apple seems to be playing the short game. Expecting customers to repeatedly pay more just to keep Apples bottom line up is a great short term plan but will hurt Apple in the long run. The price increases are simply beyond ridiculous at this point.
@apple should also do just general logos emojis clothing logos and electoronic logo emojis
Went to @apple store. Hey battery life is bad, they tell me diagnostic is not that bad but will still change it for free... fucking A customer service

@apple please give us dual-app capabilities
Stay away from @Apple products!!! I purchased a laptop 2 years ago and all of a sudden it stopped working! I took it into apple and they quoted me $500 to fix it. Spend your money elsewhere, their quality has gone down the drain.
This is why @Apple wants you to think the new iPad Pro is a notebook PC, writes @DLLabs . http:// bit.ly/2zs5uLD #Apple $ AAPL #tech
@Apple @Samsung First to dm gets a free idea for their next phone (or phone update).
What corporate bureaucracy will I attempt to navigate next? Schedule a battery replacement for my iPhone. Last time I did this.. oh boy, did I rue the day. Surely it will be easier this time, right? Anything should be easier than it was last time.... ..... ... ... .. @Apple
Ok, ok, ok: @Apple . Make the AirPods waterproof so that you can listen to music in the shower. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
aye, there's the rub! The thought of buying all your apps again in the Google Play Store could be a depressing one! Once you are in the @Apple walled garden it's difficult to leave. Once you leave though, oh, it's so great! Freedom to use your device how you want to use it!

Just abandoned @apple for @Android . The hardware just didn't hold up. The $ they charge is for a high end phone. Something that it's not. I'll never eat of that fruit again. #nokia you're up.
What color do the @Apple employees wear again? This is getting ridiculous!
Seemingly, @Apple maps is to @googlemaps as @bing is to @google search. @google is still king of both though.
Adjusting screen brightness daily is getting super old. Hope @Apple releases a 5K #CinemaDisplay real soon.

Since (and before too) the 1st @Apple #iPadPro . iPads shown they are beast reliable machine for any kind of task. But the lack of pro apps #finalcut and #logic is void to fill ASAP. With the #ipadpro2018 @Apple have to do something. Maybe next #WWDC

Why would @Apple ( @tim_cook ) choose to release its new products on NOVEMBER 7? Right after Election Day? I hope all those in the STAR WARS-long lines for those Apple Macs and iPads have already voted or will vote November 6. (Makes you wonder if that release date was deliberate.)

A simple, real life example - I've got old photos stored on CD-ROMs. I'd love to jump on the "iPad is the new computer" bus, I'd happily upload all of the photos into the iCloud - at the moment there's absolutely no way if you ditch your laptop shame, @apple got so close...

Turned on assistive touch just so i can easily access reachability without triggering UI elements. @apple when manipulating the home-bar you really need to prevent accidental input to underlying UI elements.
Move on from headphone jacks.. 1. Not used headphone jack 4 years/Bluetooth. Not used usb stick in 2 yrs. /Airdrop. Not used a cd in..? 5 years / online/download. Not plugged my macbook into router in 5 years / Wi-Fi @Apple were first to drop all of these.
@apple #iphoneXR production boost to be put on hold. #lol #weak demand for new #iPhone perhaps. 60 production line capacity was already working with 45 and now deceasing. Perhaps #apple did get it wrong after all. #business #strategy #sales #mobile #tech #IOS12
You're right. But the rollback was so good on my @apple iWatch until I figured I had to trade-off something. LOL! #rollbacks
Ever wonder why the @Apple #iPhoneXS price is a bit excess(see what I did there)? An economic principle called price elasticity can be referenced here. Many companies will test market Econ & group psychology to see how they can influence profit. #TheMoreYouKnow

@Apple Please fix your fullscreen webapp support to not show a white screen so randomly. If you launch, close, relaunch a fullscreen webapp which you have added to your homescreen often enough, it will load as a whitescreen. The only workaround is lock/unlock screen.

wow im disgusted @Apple @iTunes yall rly think that any artist outside of the u.s needs to have bots to chart an album as if china didn't represent 1/6th of the worlds population by itself
(Got blocked so I need to come up here) You can also read this article about how @Apple almost went out of business and are now thriving. It shows that little businesses sometimes you make cutbacks but they can make a difference. https://www. entrepreneur.com/article/272710
The last two interconnect standards that @Apple has adopted have both been openish industry standards... Qi, and USB-C. Is post-Jobs Apple finally past the MFI obsession with proprietary ports like Lightning?
@Apple Thank you again for finally updating the Mac mini, but I hope you're aware of the pricing issue. It's too expensive.

...sure it was "kind" of @Apple @AppleSupport to offer the $70 fix, but I'm too stubborn to have to pay a fee for a poorly made screen / out-of-the-box damage.

$ AAPL @Apple is so stingy they arent even generous enough to give reasonable entry level storage space on SSD. If you want to breath you have to pay.
the only option for the ginger guy emoji is having a creeper stache.. @Apple what kinda fuckery is this? Fix this.

This wouldve been a product worth spending money on. @Apple continues to be behind the curve and do as little as possible. $ AAPL was years ahead of everyone 2007-2010. After iPhone 5 It all went downhill in terms of product design, product aesthetics, and innovation @tim_cook
It actively bothers me that the Activity icon in iOS isn't ... active. I mean, the rings were presumably designed to be able to convey the information quickly even within the space of an icon; there are other active icons; just why not @Apple . And global inequality. That too.
@Apple @AppleSupport Are there any differences between the "new" iPhones you buy from Apple or from a provider with a mobile phone contract???... So differences in hardware and software???... Or are both mobile phones the same in terms of equipment???...
Companies like $ AMZN focus on making the best product. Companies like $ AAPL are focused on: how can we make as much as possible by doing as LITTLE as possible. @Apple Apple without a doubt is the laziest FAANNMG company. @tim_cook @jimcramer @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney @CNBCnow

@Apple my emojis command is not working on MacBook Air pic.twitter.com/nduLiFcfTA
Hi @Apple can you bring yourselves to modernity and please add dark mode to iOS ? Especially with these OLED screens
That's interesting. WTH @Apple ?
... not working like I expected @apple . pic.twitter.com/gRgdLtxC3X
I still get eye shocked by @Apple iOS's apps that have very bright white background. "Aaaw! My eyes!" :-D iOS dark mode is a must! ;-)

@apple needs to stop adding new apps that most of us will never use. Allow us to decide. Stop filling up our iPads and iPhones with absolute nonsense.
Until @apple removes the colon key. You know it's next.
ok forreal @Apple please redesign your podcast app
[...] The People that are really good want to work with the best people they can find. Hopefully people that are even better than them [...] Watch Steve Jobs passionately defend his commitment to @Apple in 1997 @CNBC #leadership #leader #motivation pic.twitter.com/5qeNl9CVZp
Really impressed with the latest @Apple iPhone/iOS integration with @LastPass . Using credentials stored in LastPass is super easy. App logins so simple now. Apple, next please make it easier to store new/updated credentials and add support for Web AuthN.
I really wish that all new @Apple computers would come with dedicated keys for both the eggplant and the peach emoji.
Why would @Apple say that @ATT can put a second line on an @Apple XS Max when @ATT says no!!! What kind of business practices are these????
caralho obg @Apple te amo
Any chance a single disabled Nurse/mom going back to school could get a hand with a Mac book @AppleSupport @apple
I don't mean to be rude, but how did @Apple make AirPods so bad? They've literally looked at what other manufacturers of Bluetooth earphones have done before them, worked out what irritated their users the most, and then doubled down on delivering those features.

Se a @Apple conseguir rastrear meu iPad furtado eu nunca mais compro outra marca
I don't know why @toyota will not give the 2018 Camry @Apple #CarPlay . The 2019 appears to be 100% identical hardware, only a software change. If @Toyota wants to keep people coming back, they need to give us this. If @Hyundai and @ford can do it, so can they.
Going to pick up my new iPhone after dinner, joining the @Apple cult again. #DateWithTheDevil
Way to go, @apple helping in this relief effort!
Cierto! Punto para @Apple . Bien jugado aunque me hace perder tres horas abriendo el equipo y quitando tornillos.

I want @Apple to add more LGBTQ+ flag emojis. Like asexual, pansexual, bisexual, transgender, intersex, non-binary, etc. I would honestly appreciate that
Presumptive text ruins a majority of my tweets. I demand @TheJusticeDept investigate @apple for making me look dumb.

When will @Apple finally allow other map/navigation apps work on the lock screen?? This selfishness with only Apple Maps working is so 2016...
I want this as a watch face on my Apple Watch! Come on @Apple , work with @LuBellWoo to make it happen!
This Is Sooo Random But I Just Have To Mention HOW GREAT 2 Of The @apple Genius Bar TECHNICIANS @The Boylston Street Store In BOSTON Were With Their Above & Beyond Customer Service #Nemo & #Brian THANK YOU BOTH
Hey @Apple what in the mother fuck compelled u to make ft so much worse w the update? Ever hear of if it aint broke dont fix it? R u making it shittier so the next update u change it back n think youre pulling a fast one on us? Y tf it take 8 hours to turn my fuckin screen around
I don't really follow the discourse on this, but does @Apple know that the Notes app's synching-across-devices abilities are, like, completely useless?

Stopped into my local @Apple store today to check out he new iPads. They seem incredible. I also looked at the XR which is very nice. What struck me the most though is that the bezels on the iMac are absolutely HUGE. Those need to go on a diet ASAP! @atpfm
Siri getting better everyday? @Apple pic.twitter.com/Lpbc4eOlo5
@Apple Question for you: my iMac is not starting and in order to receive a telephone from your helpdesk, I have to enter serial number. The original packaging and the receipt with the serial number are long gone. How do I enter a serial number given this context?
When @Apple promises they will rush your order and your $4k computer purchase matters to them, and it's the 3rd time the same computer has had the same issues...How do they think you can just live the same work life with them holding onto the computer for 3 weeks #applecare #fail pic.twitter.com/n8ZmauLdbT
- Better blind side detection - Not natural to look at your screen while changing lanes - add some sort of audio cue for blind side detection! - Reduce Long hold times for support calls (almost 45 mins on hold) - @Android Auto / @apple Car Play - USB direct audio for phones

@Apple yoooo why y'all fucking with my iPhone 6 battery y'all bugged. My shit gets drained in like 5 min 100 to 10 and then turn off
@apple
I absolutely disagree. I think @apple are misusing the term Pro
. @Apple Sent from my iPhone
This is a horrible experience. Tried it out a few times on my test device and this is definitely not intuitive for any end user. Hope @Apple changes this behavior in beta stages. Use the feedback app ASAP!

FFS @Apple if an iOS user turns Bluetooth off that means they want Bluetooth turned off. It should stay off until they decide they want it on again. Why can you not understand this?

I wonder how many people predicted @Google and @Apple entering the #AR space through #ARcore and #ARKit (respectively). But most important, what were the hints that lead to that prediction. Care to share your perspective @Scobleizer ?
I've literally fallen twice since I got my S4 @Apple Watch and it has yet to call 911 for me. I should probably be more concerned that I've fallen twice in the last week. Though I'm starting to think that I have become unbreakable. cc @MNightShyamalan
Is anybody having the problem of their iPhone XS Max not connecting to any Bluetooth speaker, or is it just me? @Apple
@Apple Please keep 3D Touch in your 2019 flagships. Pleeeease!
New @Apple @AppleEDU products are beautiful sure but they show once again that apple cares less and less for its biggest and original user base - musicians
I'm fairly saturated with @apple products and have decided not to upgrade my Mac (Mini). Why? Base model is too sparsely populated, upgrades are unrealistically priced, and everything but the RAM is soldered in so I can't upgrade it myself. Keeping my 2012 Mac Mini going.

Agreed. The premium @Apple charge for what should be cheap memory storage on all their devices is frankly scandalous! But hang on, they wouldn't have a vested interest in getting people signed up to a monthly tariff on iCloud instead, would they??

Dear fellow tech friends. @Apple is killing it at the moment. The new iPad is incredible and the MacBook Air just superb. @SamsungMobile you need to up your game
@Apple
Officially and completely over @Apple products. Always asking me to upgrade OS and then requiring me to buy an updated, expensive program THAT I ALREADY PAID FOR in order to use it in the new OS. That's blackmail. I lost a lot of music that I work with in multiple areas.
Yo, I really slept on AirPods. My bad, @apple .

@Apple you guys should put the touch id to the apple logo on the back of the phone. Just a suggestion.
Thank You @Apple for the new emoji which depicts how I feel all winter
Everything went downhill with @Apple after Steve Job passed away. Get some standards and stop screwing people. I hate my current iPhone and will be getting a Google Pixel when my contract ends.
@apple we need a vanila bar emoji
