@apple homepod is really impressive cause it gives you really good audio quality nearly anywhere in the room ...no sweet-spot hassle like with conventional audiophile 2.0 setups ... too bad there is no input ... only airplay 2 .
cc @applesupport @apple can you explain why some Geniuses ask customers to disable their computer's admin password for an off-site repair when vastly more secure options exist? Eg: securely storing the customer's password in Apple's CRM? Is this a standard question Geniuses ask?

@Apple Please fix Apple Music on Android. It's terribly slow to load a song and is extremely buggy.
When I started to see @Apple and @Microsoft Surface ads on my twitter feed, ok, I can't afford them but ok. Now I'm seeing @Airbus and @BoeingAirplanes ads as well. Seriously guys I'm just an ordinary guy. I won't be able to buy any plane any time soon! Sorry!
This is what bugs me if this exist [picture One] why can't I buy it? [picture two] it would way easier, cheaper and quicker option for buying it. @bbcdoctorwho @iTunes @Apple @AppleSupport But because TV Shows are not available in my country I can not buy it. pic.twitter.com/We5SHov1NP
