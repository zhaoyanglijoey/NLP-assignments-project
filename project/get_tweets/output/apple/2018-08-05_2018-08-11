Last week my @BankofAmerica credit card was damaged so I had to ask for a replacement. In the meantime I only used @Apple Pay on my phone as my only payment method. I just realized I can use Apple Pay almost anywhere.

It costs more to fix my cracked Apple Watch than it does to buy a new one.. @Apple needs to get it right, and quit eating people alive for their money.

My phone battery dies so quickly now. Funny how that happens like 2 months after I buy the phone. Y'all ain't slick, @Apple
I have two tiny cracks on my home button on my 8 plus. Now my phone won't even turn on. I took it to the Apple store the guy told me that the phone wouldn't work even if I fixed those 2 small cracks and they can't fix it even though it under warranty until I pay 170$ @Apple sucks

The smartest thing @Apple ever did was make iPhone to iPhone messages blue. iPhone users out here giving up the love of their life out of disgust for green messages.
Thats how I feel when I got the @Apple iPhone 7 - after they changed the earphone plug - so that you cant charge the phone and be on a call at the same time.

@Apple please update and reimagine the voice note feature. Very disheartening to record a voice note and lose it if I inadvertently touch the wrong part of the screen before I send it.
After years of @googlemaps and @waze , I used @apple maps on a rented car because it had CarPlay w/ Apple Maps the only supported one. It got me lost at least once per day, confusing directions, no lanes. I cannot fathom why anyone would choose to use it.

Not to forget the biggest cos that were expected to deepen democracy. @Apple & @Google have both evinced interest & to some extent are already helping authoritarian regimes on censorship projects! For market access and more profits! Example, @Google #dragonfly project in China!
Nation states are losing power. @Apple is the FIRST company to hit a trillion dollar market cap (in a meaningful way). But Apple isn't an American company. It's a company (a body of soldiers). Wake up. Wars aren't fought with bombs and bullets anymore. Soft is the new hard .
Can @Apple make an Apple Watch with a really big face for once????
@Apple @AppleSupport @Apple @Apple_Nederland @AppleNederland what a bad support!!! I am in Amsterdam in the Apple store, after 1,5 months with IPhone 8 Plus i have issue with loading my batery. In the store we test and have the same issue. 6! never buy Apple products anymore ..

If I was to give in and get a MacBook Pro even though it's not OLED (shock horror) which colour should I get? The silver looks a bit lighter in colour than the aluminium I've got on my old MacBook Pro, but I won't know cause @Apple doesn't have them on display in the local store.

Tengo como una hora marcando a @Apple y no me contestan
BANNING Alex Jones (irrespective of whether or not you agree with a single thing he says) for 'Hate Speech' is itself an act of Hate & Intolerance. Anti-American Shame collars to be worn by @apple , @facebook , @spotify , & @youtube .
I'm not a fan of #AlexJones & rarely click on inforwars links, but @Apple , @Facebook , @YouTube & @Spotify all coming to the same action on the same day is a YUGE tell. Obvious coordinated effort by lib-globalists to #CENSOR him, which is way more dangerous than anything he says! pic.twitter.com/wDDy0inNLA

I will be leaving @twitter if they fail to join the ban of #AlexJones along with @apple , @facebook , @youtube and @spotify .

I need go head and purchase more iCloud storage. The standard amount @Apple provide is mediocre. They know their consumers need more.
@youtube has turned into the shopping network, and only old people are on @facebook . And his 4 podcasts on @apple probably reached a whopping 3 people. This action will only make him stronger.

Today, free speech in the USA took a major blow with the censoring of @RealAlexJones and @infowars by @YouTube , @facebook , @apple , @spotify and @Pinterest . Yet, this violation of free speech is not even being covered by the main stream media. @CBSNews @ABC @NBCNews @MSNBC @CNN
@Apple whoever made the maps tell them too suck my fucking dick
Yeah I saw how @facebook @apple @paypal and @Google just censored a bunch of news sites over the past few months. But still its not free if you are paying taxes. Though here in the US a non-citizen everything is free.
2/ Get a megaphone, a permit, and exercise your free speech. Otherwise, you just got told what @Google , @Apple , @YouTube and others corporately think of you, your followers, and your content.
@apple @google why have you not pulled @RealAlexJones app from the App Store and Play Store?
This is a TERRIBLE day for ALL of our freedoms. It's time to ban @Google @facebook and @Apple

To all #Qanon followers: Last spring, Q attacked @jerome_corsi & Alex Jones, 2 proven patriots. Today, pro-Chinese & anti-American corporations @Google , @Facebook , @Apple banned Alex Jones & @Infowars from their platforms. See any connections? Use your brains. Q is a traitor!
@tim_cook ? This makes no sense! iPhones will be confiscated if you go this route as the tyrannical elites will control you & @Apple to! China is posturing in the South Pacific & will start WW3 if not already! Qatar's Qualcomm will be #1 & the new Riyadh>HRC has a Qatari Palace 2
Those supporting fake hate speech BS as a way to silence those you disagree with are sad people that have no clue. They will come for you too. Reinstate Alex Jones @Apple @facebook @Spotify Hate Speech does NOT exist... It's just speech YOU hate. It's STILL PROTECTED! #IBOR

Unless @madebygoogle improves the gestures in @Android from what they are now then I will be passing on the Pixel 3 and probably moving to an @Apple iPhone 11. iOS gestures are way better than the Pixels right now.
Alex Jones is a hypocrite and an individual who exemplifies all the wrongs in society. Making Sandy Hook and the 9/11 terrorist attacks seem like a joke is NOT OK!! @facebook @Apple @Spotify @YouTube all did the right and moral thing to remove his content from their platforms.
@Apple @AppleiDesigner In iOS 12 can we get the feature to turn off WiFi and Bluetooth in the command center instead of the feature to disconnect them?

The people that stop following @mflynnJR were not worth having a follow from. This is about free speech. @facebook , @Apple , @Spotify this censorship of Infowars is an attack on the 1st amendment. We won't forget your traitorous act. We had faith, it is gone. Spotify is done.
@tim_cook Why are there no precautions or ways to help the public put into action around the iTunes gift card scamming?? Why can't I find anyone @Apple to help????
So @facebook , @YouTube , @Apple , and @Spotify all ban @infowars within mere hours of each other, but racist #SarahJeong , #LouisFarrakhan , and violent #Antifa aren't. And only three months before mid terms? Yeah... Nothing to see here. https:// youtu.be/qm4Pks_1_hI

Downloaded the @infowars app. Never really cared before, but if @Apple and @facebook consider it to be so dangerous that they need to censor it I want to know why. Shamefully @Apple made re-enter my id and verify my CC to do so. Dangerous ideas indeed. #StopCensorship
@SamsungMobileUS You have officially lost a customer. I brought a Gear watch in March, the band broke and I'm being charged for your faulty equipment. Never had these problems with @Apple . Guess I will go back where they appreciate their customers.
SooooooobI really hate that I had to buy a splitter for my iPhone like this is so stupid. put the aux port back @Apple
@Apple So your company says IP67 certified for the iPhone X and yet when water gets in my phone in a rain storm and I go to the Apple store to get help they want me to buy a new phone. This is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable for Apple to not back their product #liars

@Apple yo safe for the feature on the 8+ where it burns your hand if you charge it and use it at the same time, bare useful that

@Apple worth one trillion U.S dollars. They don't produce the most technologically advanced products. They don't produce superior products. They don't produce the least flawed products. They don't produce the cheapest products What they do produce is superior marketing.
Make sure you all don't give in to @apple and their shit products. My airpods fried themselves and could have potentially hurt me and their service still decided to deny my warranty (bought them July 1st). Just be careful. Don't want to burn your ears off or whatever
@Apple Please fix a major issue in MacOS that causes it to treat CTRL, ALT, CMD, SHIFT, and Caps Lock separately per keyboard. No other OS treats it this way that we are aware of (including iOS), and it creates significant problems for split keyboards working correctly on MacOS.

Honestly though, the logic board on any device doesn't just go. Devices are like people. There are signs. My phone was fine a week ago, then the battery started draining after I updated *coughTHECLASSACTIONLAWSUITcough* then it died and wouldn't charge. Prove me wrong @Apple
"When is someone going to expose @Apple and all of its stores for the scammers and thieves they really are", I type on my iPad mourning the apparent loss of my iPhone, while thinking about the MacBook charger I have to buy now to purchase a new iPhone.
I want @Apple to create a site and app similar to what Twitter does, but with good rules and a moral conscience, so we can all go there instead and dump Twitter. Or maybe @Amazon or another major player could build a site and invite everyone to switch -- I bet it'd work.

Dear Mr. Cook ( @apple ): Just a heads up. You might never be able to take off the #TrumpStench . Sincerely, America
Was so disheartened when I heard about the dinner. I only use @apple products and love the company. I only hope that Tim holds true to values, I think he is too intelligent to be a Trumpster

@Spotify , can you please update the homescreen widget look for currently playing music on @Android ? Because the widget certainly isn't appealing. This almost made me switch to @AppleMusic and @Apple devices. Please @SpotifyCares #android #androidpie #spotify #pleasinglooks
Ah, lads. You forgot the major contributors to @Apple #APPLE 1 trillion valuation: Tax Optimisation, Shares Buybacks, & use of cheap labour. Apart from that, things are fine in your graphic depiction.
@elonmusk should partner with @Apple and take Tesla motors to another level
It's incredible how an #iPad can make a difficult situation, like being stuck in a hospital, more enjoyable with movies, TV shows and the web! Thanks @Apple @tim_cook @pschiller @cue @AngelaAhrendts
I have a question for Mr. @tim_cook and @Apple and I plan on asking this to several big companies and owners... If you could please tell me in a simple 1 or 2 sentences "What is your companies Mission Statement"?
@Huawei is coming on <VERY> strong against @Apple . It's a beautiful thing to see unless you LIKE paying more for your #iPhone than your #Laptop ? #Competition is a good thing and #overdue . @tim_cook having dinner w/ @realDonaldTrump tonight. Speak conservatively Mr. President
@Apple listen-
When @apple tells you that you have to update your iPhone so it can charge on your @apple laptop... nice try...
Hey @apple ...I really need a Trash Can emoji in my life...

Nice work. Go @Apple @tim_cook and #kag
I would love it if @apple re-used the iBook name on an e-ink e-reader. No need for LCD. Very happily pay too much money for it.
Looking forward to the @PolySwarm #party tonight, 5-10pm and (re-)connecting with awesome people like @insitusec , @kees_cook , @sk3wl and folks from: @Google , @Apple , @intel , @Cisco , @Qualcomm , @McAfee , @FireEye , @RedHat , @splunk , @Lookout and many more!

Only thing @Samsung has done worth a damn lately side from the camera on the S9+ is they haven't given in to the notch. That's it. And b4 the haters say I'm an @Apple fanboy I'm posting this from an S9+. Oh and they got their phones to stop exploding so there's that.
Have @apple and big tech invest in and train the underemployed inner city youth.

@Apple you just lost a sale of 2500 dollars because of the attitude of a sales person in NYC near central park. Gave me false information he was the assistant manager.
@Apple @AppStore please can you comment? So you guys don't allow Progressive Web Apps on AppStore?

@Apple your products are shitty
The 10% stake of @Apple which was sold for $800 back in the 70s is now worth $100B. Just imagine
The fact that Apple allows others to share the WiFi password with other Apple users out typing it in is awesome. Good job @Apple

2 charges, 1 for 7.50 and another for 13.50 that i did not authorize from @Apple after reporting twice to @AppleSupport ive heard nothing back from them. Be careful and check your account people. Dont let fraudulent charges catch you by surprise!

@Apple ..how about showing real work being done on the iPad? Real stories that have nothing to do with the arts, but real people, doing real things with the technology. Again, no one takes notes like this video portrays.

Seriously fed up with @Apple finally update my 2012 Macbook Pro to HS afte4 putting it off for so long and bam! Turns into an unusable POS. Lightroom takes a year to do anything, beach ball makes an appearance every 5 seconds. Kids, never update an Apple product.
@Apple Hey guys, I'd never get an iPhone (nothing against them, just not my style) but I would literally pay for an Android version of iMessage
@apple sent me the 67775567th flood warning and this time I was driving and my Bluetooth was connected. Honestly next time just let me drown.
The GPS app on the iPhone has made one too many blunders for me to keep quiet about. Ended up completely lost on the top of a mountain, an hour away from my destination, during a torrential downpour @Apple @AppStore

@Apple WHERES THE DAB EMOJI!!!!!!!
If message services are end to end encrypted, how is that different from e.g. @Apple 's "San Bernadino" fight against a special backdoored version of iOS ? Surely a backdoored version of a messenger client will be detectable, even if magically signed by @Apple or @Whatsapp etc ?
Hey @Publix , your registers support @SamsungPay but NOT @Apple Pay? What gives?!
