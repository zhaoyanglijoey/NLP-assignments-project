Fix it @apple @jesus
I don't need a smartphone with a fancy features or mass hysteria gimmicks! What I need, is a phone that is reliable enough in the long run! And I think Apple stays true to that! I've come into my final decision, iPhone 7plus on Friday payday! Hello @Apple
How come whenever @Apple updates new #emojis you can never find them there needs to be a new emoji section #wheresthenewemojis
Finally updated my phone so I could see the new redhead emoji, only to find out they gave us literally one expressionless option. Come on @apple - how hard is it to add red as a hair color option for all the other emoji people you have?
happy birthday to my damn self #upgradedfinally #iPhoneXSMax #applewatch4 @Apple pic.twitter.com/doq7o6uaWU

After over a year of debating what laptop I should buy, I finally decided on the @Apple 13 inch macbook pro. Hopefully it will last as long as my previous laptop, which was the Sony Viao. That had a 10 year life span.

Is there anything more capitalist than @apple losing a lawsuit for ripping off their customers and being allowed to sell the solution back for a profit?

Fascinating to see @apple running an ad campaign themed as "share your gifts" when the company's entire value is intellectual property.

@apple Please fix Siri. I am disgusted and will never use your service again. At least Google and Alexa do not offer up porn to serious questions.
is it just me or does @Apple never tweet anything? It seems strange for such a huge company.
Hey @apple ... fuck you and your stupide dongle.
El unico maldito problema de @Apple es que no funcionan sus accesorios, koreeee ya cambie dos veces mi cargador este mes
The new #ShareYourGifts @Apple commercial is so touching and simply amazing! Huge congrats to the creators and animators!
@Apple let your customers or your try out buyers customise their phone let them be them not you chose them to be. @Android Big props to you, but your devices are still shit. Please someone out of the blue make something better.
@Apple I use your Products but your ideas are just a laugh. @Android I used to be a android fan boy but your updates are getting shitter on everyone phone of yours.

I would like to personally thank @Apple for finally adding a redhead emoji ... took long enough

@UPS is by far the worst delivery service, changing dates, not knowing where my package is or why is being retained in my own city is frustrating. @Apple should change its delivery service company ASAP. #HappyThanksgiving

Big ups to @madebygoogle for making the google mini. It's essentially all I need for work. Likely going Amazon for family entertainment tho. Keep at it, so odd @Apple is choosing to be left in the dust here. They used to make the best hardware - still fuming over @nest maybe?

@Apple @iPhone_News Please let me know when your Animoji feature gets the rights to either @MLB or @NHL hat logos. All my friends are wondering why I am not wearing a hat. Has to be @RedSox or @NHLBruins , Just saying. You got my #, hit me up.
@Apple way to develop tech that actually works in real life situations. Current example, phone unlocked whilst picking nose. Never thought technology would take us this far
