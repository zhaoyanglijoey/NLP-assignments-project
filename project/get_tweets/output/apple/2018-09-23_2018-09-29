I'm so pissed at @Apple shoddy attempt at 2 factor security. I've locked myself out of a device which is on iOS 8 due to that ios not supporting it! I can't even log in to update the software! Looks like I'll have to create another Apple ID!! Yes! @AppleSupport @AppleNewsUK

$1500 for the new @Apple iPhone XS Max that crashes more then a drunk driver on PCP. Way to blow it (crashed 8 times trying to post this)
It's hard to take @Apple 's big bet on USB-C seriously when not even its own #iPhones come with a USB-C cable http:// bit.ly/2O5pKvX

Anyone else noticing weirdness in the GPS/location services of #iOS12 ? We are in HKG and both @googlemaps and @apple Maps are wonky. Compass moves all over the place, accuracy can be off by a block or two. Hard to navigate streets.
@Apple If LTE Apple Watch (Series 4) is truly about being free from iPhone ANYTIME, then why haven't you enabled (Wireless) Carplay with it? Please consider!

Hey @Apple , if you are going to get rid of all USB ports on your computer lines, how about you switch your handheld products to USB-C to make things easier? I know that making things easier may be challenging for you but, a consumer can hope.

@Apple has wayyyy too much money to be that money hungry. You charging $300+ to FIX an IPhone 7.
#Apple selling the "Innovative" #iPhoneXS is just like me selling my crap, calling it chocolate pudding and suddenly become worth a trillion dollars. That's how genius Apple's marketing is. @Apple will learn when @oneplus releases the #OnePlus6T .
Why do you guys not have any screen protectors or bumpers to protect my new watch @Apple
Apple has complied with the warranty of my iPhone X. I'm not wrong buying Apple. Thank you so much @Apple @AppleSupport
I swear that @Apple kills my phone every time a new one comes out
One good thing about @Apple #iOS12 is that it shows the screen time of how much time you spend on each app and shame you for spending a quarter of your day on mobile device.
@Apple @AppleSupport me and my friends were having a discussion on why dont you guys make airpods with different sizes?! Personally, i have seen your regular airpods causing wounds because of its size ! 7 billion dont have the same ears size . plz , confirm if you get my msg.
@Apple amina koyim
@Apple Once you start innovating again, doing what you say you do every year like you used to, I'll be the first person to buy your iPhone.
Okay. Imagine this. Make a full football team of players who use @Apple phone and a full team of @SamsungUS users... And then you have the Apple v Samsung football game. I'd watch that. Imagine the marketing.
@Apple #batteryReplacement The bullshit trap to bring customer to ur store,waste hours of there time,probably steal data and then say sorry we cannot change battery,as we see some droplet of water inside,on a perfectly working phone & then ask them to pay full for a new phone.

Dear @Apple iOS 12 sucks. Fix it now
Every time I think I might switch back to iPhone, my wife tries to update her playlist with iTunes. Never going back to that mess. @Apple @AppleMusic
I promise it feels like @Apple markets to children. Their commercial never mentions features or differentiating attributes that should give the regular adult reason to buy the product. Instead they show you pretty colors with contrasting backgrounds.
@Apple has anyone notice when your in bed with lights turn off on your iPhone X - trying to use the Face ID to unlock your phone there a small red light flashed just before it unlocked. Now it this the government trapping my phone #conspiracy #101
Face ID is not twin-proof @apple
Yo @Apple why cant I get a friend's and family discount? My people assembled the phones, it's only fair.
So, now i've been dealing with @ATT and @Apple and @AppleSupport and the "Authorized" @BestBuy @GeekSquad for over 24 hrs. and literally NOBODY can do anything for me until @Apple mails the new phone...

macOS Mojave dark mode is amazing! Thanks @Apple !
The fact that @Apple owns @beatsbydre and the iPhone XS Max still comes with apple ear pods is garbage. This phone is so expensive that it should come with in ear beats. Either way this phone is fucking amazing.
@Google I believe you will set some reasonable price of upcoming #pixel3 Every @Apple user is switching so this is the perfect opportunity to grab market from them #googleevent #9october

OS X Mojave looks absolutely terrible on non-retina screens. The text in literally everything is borderline unreadable. #YouHadOneJob @Apple
@Apple I beg you, let me wait in line, please. I just want to give you money.
well ... my opinion is that @SamsungMobileUS & @Apple will be still having it out for the top 1 & 2 seats. Unless of course @Google is throwing out #disinformation & the phones will be the complete opposite of what's been leaked ...
@Apple I want to think Apple for making it right on my watch they fixed it and sent it back to me
Stop fucking up my phone every year you fucking bitches. Fight me you know where I fuckin live. @Apple
Tomorrow will be like Christmas in the Marsh household. For @amazon is delivering new @apple cords for all of our phones.

@Apple commercial (cont) 3/3: - Eventually cab catches up to bus, it stops, the bus driver hops out to empty baggage, iPhone owner runs up, asking if they have seen it, cries when the driver pulls it out of his pocket. - Only Apple. - What do you think?
@Apple this number is using a phishing website thats pretending to be apple inc and tried charging us $150 to un freeze their phishing website. This is the phone number that is charging people as apple care 1 (866) 608-6989

Disappointed w @Apple 's image selection re: MacOS Mojave - a SAND DUNE?!?! I hope, at least, that's the Kelso Dunes. The definitive image of the Mojave Desert is the indicator species, a Joshua Tree. Sand dunes are the world over, but Joshua Trees are only found in the Mojave.

@Apple make a keyboard case for the ipad, but wait, on this one, put a couple REGULAR type usbs on it! but wait, while at the same time adding support for reading hard drives. BOOM. absorb all sales everywhere. why havent you already done this?
@Apple @pschiller @tim_cook can we get Dark Mode for Apple Remote Desktop??
I knew it wouldn't be long before we saw issues with the new #iPhoneXS Almost as if @Apple don't test their products, just like #MacBookPro2018 thermal throttling, who'd have thought a Pro device wouldn't be pushed & a phone would need to make calls http:// bit.ly/iPhoneXSIssues
Remember the good old days when upgrading @apple MacOS would play you a sweet new @royksopp track? Bring that back
Despite @apple and their walled garden ecosystem, and me being an avid @Google Pixel user for the past 2 years, this is the closest I've been in 6 years of buying an iPhone... Google security just isn't cutting it. I can't deal
Hey bmac! Did @apple finally fill in the bottom are on the keyboard?? Or is that gap still there??

Adtech vendors use well-known + obscure device characteristics to do device fingerprinting. It's an arms race. @Apple should make fingerprint results from visitors to its home page transparent, including illustrating how effective Safari 12 is at thwarting device fingerprinting.
@apple Why is copy/paste in Photos such complete AIDS? I just want to select a photo from my library and copy it to clipboard. Windows had it right for literally 25 years. Hell, iPhoto used to have it right. How do you mess this up? Do you test your products on people under 80?
Just as before upgrading to this #iOS12 was not like that, surely I should change brands, I believe I bought with flaws and this makes me totally irritated. I'm saying goodbye for you @Apple .
I got the iPhone #XS but why did @Apple take out some of the bottoms speakers?
@LinusTech How about at the keynote they mentioned 120hz touch panel?.. Also a scam. You very well know everyone instantly thought "Pro-Motion". @Apple is getting dirty. They also killed the "One More Thing". #iPhone

Seems that @apple have deemed my owned and paid for digital movie assets as unfit for inclusion into my media library. Just waiting for them to take away all my other things they sold to me as being "own this".
@Apple in case you were thinking of giving me a job, I never said that. Iphones are great. I bow to you

@Apple so now I don't have an Apple product I don't have to trust that number no more now I'm stuck with the Apple TV that I can't use because I can't log into it and no one at Apple support could help me... Not happy at the moment Apple there's support team does not really help
@Apple since I don't have another Apple product nor the number that is associated with my account it's not letting me change the number because it keeps asking me for that 6 digit code I spoke to Apple and no one at Apple support could help me this is really not a good look.....
I just want to watch @AmazonVideo on my @Chromecast using my @apple #iPhone8
@Apple I am starting to realize how bad it is only Apple products nowadays I don't have an Apple product anymore yet I got purchased a Apple TV and when I went to login it was asking me for my two-factor code now since I don't have another Apple product ....

Every year apple says "best iPhone ever". But this year I think @Apple can claim "most beautiful iPhone ever". My iPhone XS Max gold, sitting on my desk face up & turned off looks stunningly beautiful. It looks better turned off than any other phone on or off. :)
@Apple really needs to add two security guards at the door. I get that the devices self destruct basically, but when they start robbing customers as well then it will be different.

@Apple Very upset...trying to edit a 4K video and it's taking over 45 min. IphoneX isn't that fast. Very upset.
So @Apple is discontinuing their amazing print service and telling us to use Photos extensions instead...but no Photos extensions are available (including @Shutterfly ) in the App Store? Silliness. Apple, bring the print service back and TAKE MY MONEY!
Same problem with some keys not working. No adequate response yet. Purchased through @Apple for an iPad 12.9. A fix or replacement would be appreciated. Not what you would expect for a pricey keyboard/case.
Yooooo do you know how long it takes to drag a new song to the top of your playlist since the iOS12 update!? Too long @Apple @AppleMusic
@Apple can you please add a feature on iMessage where our favorite people we text can stay on top of the iMessage list. Please!!!

I would say the first is 90% going to happen this year. Next year, they could be using USB-C on iPhones(probably why they did not include fast charging this year - unnecessary cost for just a year). But knowing @apple , they may just ship the phone without any ports.
I wonder how many guys have used the new @Apple #measurement app to, you know, measure those #junk !
Hey @Apple freebie for you. The killer feature for HomePod would be allowing anyone on my Wi-Fi network to add songs to a queue of songs to play. Has to be from Their phone.
You can use any two providers you want, except one will have to support e-sim and after @Apple updates the software to support the e-sim.

Hey @apple , free design tip for next iOS: swipe back feature like @instagram rather than top left back arrow that only @KingJames and @obj can reach.
@Apple me estais tocando los con el puto corrector !!
As mentioned, other companies such as @apple jumped right into the Chinese market and added state censorship. @google left the Chinese market to their detriment out of moral reasoning. If the us govt was properly functioning it could incentivize/deincentivize good/bad behavior.
@fitbit couldn't take two credit cards. They wouldn't reduce the amount by $2 and there is no one else to talk to. It is as if they don't want my money. I'm sure that @GarminFitness or @apple would love my business. I'm in the customer service business and this is atrocious

After playing with the new @Apple #iPhoneXSMax I can say with a clear conscience, this is the best mobile phone on the market and the upgrade for older iPhone users are worth it, especially if you rely heavily on mobile cameras for photo and video! Best iPhone ever made.
#RequestForProduct A feature on @apple watch that deactivates your access to post to social media(and text) once it detects the wearer is inebriated.
