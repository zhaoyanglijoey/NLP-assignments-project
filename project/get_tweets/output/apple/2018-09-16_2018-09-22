Don't be surprised if @Apple 's move to become a luxury brand boosts its profits in the next quarter or so http:// bit.ly/2xhDWbF
Thanks for sharing! Exactly what I'm talking about. Since we know #Fitbit from published data does not increase #health #healthylifestyle the only plausible outcome is $$$. @Apple @aetna win-win. At least we get free #AppleWatchSeries4
Congrats @Apple ! First time ever your map is better than @googlemaps ! They still have the location for our address wrong!
@Apple even if i had $1500 to burn, i would NEVER spend that much on a phone. i get it's the upgraded model, but what happened to the smaller=$300 & LG=$600? then they have the nerve to take the AUX adapter back. hope the majority of ppl don't buy, or get used to price increases.
okay no really my battery life has been trash lately @apple wassup?
It's @Apple that hiked the price. Not T-Mobile
@Apple why cant the apple xr be bought without a sum card or carrier
@Apple you guys should really work on #iMovie and add more features like after effect and more.

@Apple is coming out with new colors for their new phones, this is good marketing because the last phone they did this with had good sales.
@Apple I would love your support in making this educational experience available to my low-income students!

@Apple Is there any chance of the system crashing b/c everybody trying to get IOS 12 all at once??? #IOS12Concern Thanks!

What about an @apple iPhone 6 with iOS12 in 2018? Does it make sense? #AskMKBHD
@AppleSupport @Apple any reason why Google Maps isn't working on Carplay ios 12?
Have HP desktop and laptop for over 10 years w/o one issue. That said with 2 iPhones and 2 iPads next computer/laptop will be an @Apple due to aforementioned photos and other functions.
@Apple God said I may have the new iPhone and Apple Watch ~ if you give it to me
@Apple Hey , would you like give me iPhone Xs max 256 GB for free?
Because @apple is rather disjointed, you must install the full, non-Microsoft-store version of iTunes in order to be able to install iCloud drive. @msftenable in case this comes up. Please RT for those who don't know this.
i been on the phone allllllll afternoon w/ @Apple & still no solution to my problem of trying to my recover Itunes/Icloud account....sooooo irritating!!!!!
Bring on #macOSMojave @Apple
@apple is no longer "Cool" - just a bunch of old washed up people from the past - Steve Jobs would be horrified at this garbage.
The recent @Apple keynote was the most boring presentation I have ever witnessed. Steve Jobs would have #TimCook by now - no doubt - the man has zero charisma - ZERO

Boo hoo hoo @Apple smart watches are produced in #China and tariffs could hurt their exceptional profits That was THEIR RISK to hire cheap labour in China... Not OUR risk Trump caved by giving them a tariff carve out. Shame.
. @apple I was going to take the week off to learn #ios12 but I ran through all the new functionality in 10 minutes. #disappointed
That's a paddlin @Apple
For iOS 13 can we focus on customization??? @Apple
Yo, @Apple when are you giving us the new emojis? I would like to accurately express myself with the red haired female rather than blonde
@Apple thanks for the iOS 12 update super smooth on the iPhone X so far. Fixed a bunch of issues I was having especially the pull down for the quick reply.
@apple new processor might beat it. And why it can not beat @intel which still using old 14 nm processor? I hope @qualcomm working harder
@Apple @AppleSupport ITS BEEN ALMOST 5 hours and my watch is still downloading unacceptable
@Apple why is my iphone8S starting to trip? Just bought this thang...
y is my phone broken always @Apple
Well so much for this product @Apple
Hey @Apple is #iOS12 the update that will slow down my phone and drain my battery until I get the new iPhoneXS?Or is that the next update you will have coming up?
@Apple give us ios8 apple music formatting
Just update to iOS 12. I can see the difference. Nice one @Apple
This @SamsungMobile product placement travesty on @enews #RedCarpetLive is precisely the reason I'll never leave @Apple . Y'all are just sloppy. Stop it. And get a new agency.
Downloaded the new #IOS12 @Apple
So on Friday I get to pick up my new @Apple #AppleWatchSeries4 !! So the question is do I bother dong an #unboxing video or do I just watch the rest on #youtube and write a heap of replies??
Funny that the new iPhones have all been released and now my phone is starting the bullshit of not vibrating anymore when I get a text and freezing when I open my messages. How coincidental, @Apple

@tim_cook , @Apple , can you guys find your employee, who decided to restrict access to explicit content on Apple Music for whole country (Belarus) without possibility to enable it, and punish him? @freddurst , I can not listen to your music anymore!
Thank you based @Apple Finally we have stacked notifications! #iOS12
I was just about to post that as well. @Apple really needs to do something about that process. Awful. Downloading... preparing... validating....
Girls bout to make you take a picture of ya junk with the new IOS 12 measure app before even fuckin with you smh @apple
Well just updated to Ios12 n kinda finding it brilliant atm especially the new photo app. very smooth using the new iOS nice job @Apple

@AppleSupport Ik heb iPad met WiFi en SIM kaart. WiFi werkt niet op iPad Pro met SIM. Help !!!!! SIM kaart alleen werkt wel. Met WiFi geen internetverbinding naar update naar IOS12 @ios12 @appleinsider @iCulture @Apple
#iOS12 shortcuts app sounded great, but @apple and @tim_cook decided that "driving to work" can't include a podcast, only music? Wtf?
okay what is happening to my imessage sis @Apple
Damn it, @apple @applesupport I was so excited to update my SE to ios 12 but all I have is error instead of new system
Honest keynote! @Apple iPhone! https:// youtu.be/Ydje1ivynIM @longbeachgriffy AWESOME
Okay but how is @Apple gonna make me get used to swiping my apps by holding down on them and then swiping them away and then change that, they got me looking a fool, otherwise good update tho, love the me(bit)moji
@Apple Omg I would absolutely love to see these features in IOS 13 https:// youtu.be/0iO26I34erc
@Apple please release userguide for Apple watchs5
Big week for @Apple
But why be a naysayer? If @Apple reimagines the car, I say more power to them.
But the best part is the truly mobile hospital services. At home dialysis servicing ? Train your drivers to level up on those skills. Blood draws? They come to you. And you could put together contracts for cardiac patients based off their @Apple watch stats. 9/

vou ter que parar de falar com a cler pq ela virou ios user nunca pensei que perderia minha amiga pra @Apple
@AppleSupport and @Apple needs to clarify that #Animoji and #Memoji only works for #iPhoneX and above. It is so sad that we do not get these similar features on #iPhone8Plus and older models. #iOS12
Have to be on the shitty hotel WiFi connection to update software rather than the better 4G one. @apple are fucking stupid!
@Apple is NOT making it to 2019.. sorry but fuck u!

Nah I really use this feature a lot. Fuck you @Apple
i waited for ios12 for a whole year. and it isnt that great come on apple get it together @Apple

The no.1 most annoying PITB thing about @Apple iOS is it refusing to download large o/s + App updates via my 4G connection and forcing WiFi to be used. I (as do others) have an unlimited 4G data plan & Wifi is much slower. Seriously, wtf is this not configurable by the end user??
@Apple @AppleSupport @AppStore
@Apple too much lint gets in my phone charger hole and then it wont charge
Kudos to @Apple for teaching my 5 year old the features of the iPhone
@realDonaldTrump No one ever asked, why are American companies so dependent upon Chinese labor? Maybe @Apple should begin investing in America.
Did not buy iPhoneX, because I have learned from the past that you will come up with a BETTER S version..So, now not buying iPhoneXS, because we learned from the past that, soon there will be a BETTER iPhone11..Thanks for teaching us that lesson @apple @UnboxTherapy
@Apple why do u have to stop making the silicone cases for the older phones in the seasonal colors?! i have a brand new 8+ and i cant get the case i want anymore
@Apple @AppleSupport iOS 12 continues the saga from iOS 11 to contain many animation bugs. I will post them in this thread as I find them. #doyouevenuseyourownsystem
I'm an @Apple girl, but what the HELL happened to my camera roll in iMessages with iOS12? It's now stupid amounts of inconvenient to attach a photo! ARGH. Would roll back to iOS11 if I knew how, do not recommend!
My iPhone just updated to iOS 12 and my notifications are STACKED!!! #finally @Apple

This guy reminds me of Jony Ive from @Apple
@Apple phones are honestly ass now.
@Apple has the problem that users won't read Terms & Conditions. It's obvious because you gave those to them after the purchase. Apple do you really think people would read them and ask for a return if they disagree with them? You need to make people read them before buying.
pretty sure i almost got scammed from an email claiming to be @AppleSupport @apple
You know me, I've been diehard team @Apple since my first iPhone (the 4). I am not happy rn. Apple support couldn't help, I'm so frustrated. I just paid this off, I do not have another $1000 to blow on a phone that will get outdated as soon as I pay it off.

@Apple iOS 12 has bugs... Does anyone work over there ?
when I tell my computer that its not allowed to auto update and I would update it myself and @apple forces my computer to update without my permission, that is just absolute bullshit.

Eventually I get my directions back and make it home. This is by far the worst update experience I have ever had on any device. Do better @apple #ios12fail

I wonder what @Apple and Tim Cook gave Trump and the Republicans for their tax holiday, and exemptions for the iwatch and airbuds. I am willing to bet there are some large PAC checks clearing.
There should be dark mode on everything!!! @Apple @facebook @instagram
@Apple me patrocina
I can't update to iOS12 without WIFI, but I can tether to my wife's phone and "update via WIFI" because #CanberraInternet is *terrible* ($80/m 12/1 + congestion). Come on @Apple , I've got gigs on my mobile plan. There's no reason to block updating via 4g.
And it took a couple of minutes to open one book in @AppleBooks after upgrade. Tap, tap, double tap, tap and hold, eventually my book would open. Every upgrade over the last 2 years has made my @apple devices worse. Thanks for nothing
As a society we really have to stop buying @apple stuff. They just break it themselves and charge you hundreds of dollars to fix it
I cannot hold it in. @apple I HATE THE CHANGE TO MY iPAD KEYBOARD BUTTONS (numbers/emojis) that were foisted upon me by iOS 12. I mean I really HATE it. Did I mention I DETEST it???
I LOVE trying out new task management apps. Used @OmniFocus for over a year. Used @2DoApp for over a year. Used @Apple http:// Reminders.app for Apple Watch Siri integration. Used @goodtaskapp as a wrapper for http:// Reminders.app . Currently trying @trello .
@apple since your update broke my phone I expect a new one
can you freakin believe it is impossible to rent this to stream anywhere thanks a lot @apple
Today everyone in my unit at work had their iPhones go off for an emergency flash flood warning at once. My phone did not. I feel personally attacked @Apple . Why was my safety not as valued??
Semoga Untuk Para Investor di Jakarta, Indonesia bisa membeli Saham @Apple bursa Saham Amerika.

@tim_cook @Apple never thought about people who have disabilities when removing/discontinuing the Home Button and Touch ID. #Accessibility #AppleCaresAboutDisabillity
I find it interesting that the new @Apple #ios12 update considers texting & FaceTime as social media. I believe they should be in their own category as communication apps. pic.twitter.com/OQwNnx9c4b
@apple oh dear pic.twitter.com/DWIVKVP60P
@Apple pic.twitter.com/FPJUfbIoz4
@tim_cook and @apple can you guess how many times I've wanted "Happy Birthday"/"Happy New Year" to cause my phone to animate? Go on take a guess. It's not hard. It's 0. I've NEVER wanted to do that, and don't think I should have to "reduce motion" to do it. #iOS12
The first wave of reviews of @Apple 's latest #iPhoneXS and XS Max are in, and they're widely favourable http:// bit.ly/2MJOsxd
Would I buy a cell phone for $1k? No. But I am invested in @Apple stock so imma need all you other bitches to buy it.
I went on @Apple 's website to compare the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 7 Plus cameras and there is hardly a difference between them. For now, I think I will be sticking with my iPhone 7 Plus until there are noticeable differences between cameras in the future models. pic.twitter.com/U3jOO911VP
Sticking with my X. Not paying 1,500.00 for a near non existent upgrade. Do better @Apple
Dear @apple , I swear to God if my iphoneX that I purchased one year ago starts being slow after the release of the new iPhone I will probably buy the new iPhone. Sincerely, me
Ohh yeaaaaaahhh! Is it Friday yet? @Apple #iPhoneXSMax pic.twitter.com/90vvLsCmdu
@Apple looking for answers on & cannot get @AppleSupport assistance- can anyone help?
@Apple latest update sucks! Too many glitches
Wow! Another shit update from @apple I have to download all my books again i. @AppleBooks Books that I had deleted have reappeared
@elonmusk let @Apple buy @Tesla and @tim_cook will sort out all the logistics issues for ya! World will change with friendships, not arrogance.

That's not me praising #LG as I have so many reasons not to buy another @LGCanada phone (and I won't) but their fingerprint scanner is a thousand times better than @Apple (from my experience at least)
Next update put until forever pls @Apple pic.twitter.com/suWj5J1Ynb
Q.. Does the fingerprint scanner suck on iPad or should I return it to @Apple ? It works 1% of the time for me (tested it a lot).. In contrast, my @LGCanada phone works every single time.. Is it an issue with my individual unit or should I accept it? @AppleSupport .. I'm frustrated
I want Memoji soooo badly but I have the 6s @apple
During their keynote last week, @Apple announced that the #iPhoneXS & #iPhoneXSMax would offer eSIM support. Find out what @KristenAtParks says this means for the #smartphone market: http:// bit.ly/2NFj4Et #connectedCE
@Apple when are you going to partner with @Disney to have Mickey Mouse emojis??
hey look, another iPhone I'd never buy @Apple oh and your laptops have no memory card or CD drive... no thanks......... #iPhoneXSMax #iPhone #Apple
You @apple where is the original iPhone X on your website I want an original not a new one
Hey @Apple how do I block a contact?
@AppleSupport @apple yoooo no Animoji/Memoji option in Camera but I can FaceTime with it??? @applealia pic.twitter.com/8yNPwFJKM0
Friendly reminder that @Apple has emojis for every phase/emotion of the moon: But still has not released a redhead emoji.
mau update ios kenapa lupa mulu ajg trs ini kenapa tumben @apple ga maksa update
So to access Control Centre with iOS 12 I have to swipe down on the iPad but up on the iPhone 6S - of course I get one of them wrong every time! Is this @Apple 's cunning plan to get me to upgrade to an iPhone X(S) for consistency?
Did anyone else notice @Apple customer service gone really poor. Especially in London Stratford in @westfieldlondon . #applecustomerservice
@Apple muda o nome do iPhone pra iMeucu
I wish @apple would make the camera full screen like on the iPad!! It'll look much cleaner and futuristic and it'll take full advantage of the OLED display
I have a new phone. AGAIN. Three #iPhones --THREE--have bootlocked on me. Three strikes you're fucking OUT, @Apple . I have a #Samsung J3 Star, now.
Ability to schedule @AppleSupport call ahead of time but the actual support received? Lacking to say the least. Was asked if I had tried to charge my @Apple AirPods without the case
Yo @apple whateva u did u broke this app now fix it
It has been 3 years of waiting to use @Apple pay. You need to support your customers. @Apple is nearly 50% of the Australian market!
@google @apple @microsoft @ibm @Tesla @SpaceX Do you believe climate change is real?
Seriously hoping that @VZWSupport can help me, otherwise I'm going to be really pissed off that I now have to pay $200 to fix my phone with them instead of $99 with @Apple
My iphone suddenly wants to act jancky. SMH That new iOS update trying to force me into getting the new phone. I WAS GETTING IT ANYWAY @Apple

I think @Apple doesn't include a fast charger because they think we don't need it. They think that there batteries are so damn good that we don't need a fast charger and we can use that little 5w charger to just charge our phones overnight. Just my opinion. #Apple #mythoughts
And on that note, it seems as if @Apple has just quietly stopped sending to the Apple Product Security mailing list, so if you count on that, yeah, don't. #Sysadminnery
Fact: You can't watch a video in full HD on the new iPhone XR in 2018 #apple @Apple pic.twitter.com/gmxDvXusgT
All is lost, @Apple , shut it down, Samsung beat you to the fridge, I'm sorry friends
@tim_cook on Good Morning America you said you want to sell the best phone possible, but there's still a huge feature missing, dark mode. Is this something we can possibly look forward to in the future? Thank you in advance. @Apple
Given that @apple 's newest phones still offer only 4GB of operating RAM (in this era when Androids now regularly do 6 and 8GB), I am guessing the low spec is due to a memory addressing limitation inherent in Apple's custom CPU design.
Yes, @Apple used to be the market leader who pushed technological advancement, but not anymore. seems like more budget friendly companies are starting to take lead in this department now. couldn't agree more with @UnboxTherapy https:// youtu.be/rpeFbaf6XkM #ThinkDifferent #NoMore
I think AirPods should come free when you buy an iphone that is more than $900 @Apple
And force reboot 3 to get iOS 12 Internet working again. This is clearly yet another @Apple .0 release: no QA at all.
Hey @Apple put your money where your mouth is and cover water damage in your Apple care.

#iOS12 is great, but... The Emoji symbol is on first position and .?123 symbol is on second position on my #iPad2018 keyboard. It should be .?123 first and Emoji second! On my #iPhone it is correct! @Apple @AppleSupport

You have $750? iPhone XR: 720p notched LCD display. Unknown battery capacity. Single lens camera. iOS12. No fingerprint scanner. No fast charger/case/dongle included. Honestly, what @Apple are doing here is taking their customers for absolute fools.
@apple why does it take so long to restore from icloud??
@Apple does the #ApplePencil work with @Tayasui_apps for sketches...? #help
Gotta give big props to @UnboxTherapy for his latest video! Keeping it real and showing consumers that #TeamAndroid is where it's at. @Apple could've given you a better "budget friendly" phone, but they didn't! I think this is the time to start looking at ALL other options out

@Apple fuckin up my phone on purpose again once the new phone is about to be released ....
It sucks to be thinking of going nack to #iPhone because my #SamsungNote8 Is freezing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled everything. #disappointed @SamsungSupport @Apple
iOS 12 comes out and smart invert STILL DOESNT WORK well done @Apple
So @Apple you announce new phones with E-Sim, but don't have the software to support your E-Sim feature....so I still have to carry two phones around, even with your new phone. That's the dumbest thing ever.
@Apple In love with the #iOS12 beta 1. Good job Apple with the regular updates. Now, waiting for the watch and the ECG in it as well.

@Apple you will see hands if my X starts acting up once that new iOS update drops with the XS. Just saying... lawsuits can happen since you told on yourself about purposefully slowing our shit down. Just saying. Make this year for US and not your top execs... Management.

I don't own anything @Apple -- it's all over-priced, too proprietary so you can't tweak anything to your liking, and despite its reputation for ease of use, I find much of their stuff not very user-friendly (son & spouse have iphones). Are privacy issues too
#iOS12 is disappointing @Apple
I am rather disapppointed with the lack of Asian eyes in #Memojis in @apple #iOS12 .
Check out my drop-in at @Apple Brooklyn Downtown today on my @instagram Story.
I JUST GOT THE IPHONE XS MAX!! @Apple I LOVE IT!
yes but @Apple replaced it how skinny of them
As soon as I saw @Apple sent my items via @UPS , I knew there were going to be issues. Just as I expected, they lost my package and tell me to go find it.
@Apple yalls weather app is mad doo doo son! its been saying 40% chance of rain & i still be at work not getting rained out! wtf? i predict weather better than that shit!
Super annoyed that the new iPhone XS that I purchased on the first day of pre-ordering will not arrive here until Monday. They are in stock at local stores. Online shopping fail. No excuse for @Apple and @UPS to not have the process figured out by now. Tempted to cancel the order
@BestBuy and @apple dropped the ball today on these pre orders.
i thought that was the way @Apple does things, idk theyre apparently never wrong

Anyone else order their #iphonexs from @Apple and still waiting on the delivery? I don't know who dropped the ball but I can't track my package thru @UPS like I should. #annoyed
#fullofshit @UPS_Canada how is it that the plane was late from China, 5 days ago? Someone is lying to us and we get screwed, take out money and run @Apple take #responsibility for the mistake #bs
Grateful for @Apple at the Shops at Briargate today that are trying to go above and beyond to get my phone in my hands today after many issues.

Why would @apple and @google ban @gab from their stores for download? Because both support the liberal agenda that includes speech suppression of conservatives. Remember that in your purchases. There are better options available. | #RedNationRising
New #iPhoneXS is in @Apple pic.twitter.com/RLKFKU4JE0
@apple FUCK YOU YOU PIECES OF SHIT
iOS 12 fucking sucks @Apple
Cmon @apple - no Messages complication on new Apple Watch faces?? pic.twitter.com/0dNF4SX1rr
@Apple @AngelaAhrendts I thought the retail experience was supposed to improve. Where else do you go to stand in line to find out if something is in stock, you find out it is but then you have to come back a couple hours later to pick it up, and then wait an hour for it?!
Holy XSMax! @Apple Fan Boy is @paranoidrobot
@Apple @AppleSupport
My 8 plus that I got last November has been actin up lately hmmmm.... @apple
@UPSHelp @apple I ordered a new iPhone XS 4 minutes after launch and tracking shows that it is stuck in China? It was supposed to be delivered today. What is up?
Thank you @Apple for returning Smart Categories to #Numbers ! I am freaking Thrilled! Use smart categories in Numbers - Apple Support https:// support.apple.com/en-us/HT209054
Apple! Que mal trip, ayudaaa! @AppleSupport @Apple pic.twitter.com/yiuisVniAw
Wow. This line to get my #iPhoneXSMax is insane. Can I get a free phone case and screen protector or....? @Apple
I know I shouldn't be this angry, but the only thing I was looking forward to all week was getting my new phone. Now the earliest I will see it is Monday. What's the point of pre-ordering? Thanks @apple and @fedex .
One thing i ceebs w/ @Apple is that they make it so hard for media file transfer
I"m proud of myself. Today I managed to not buy a single @Apple product. This mainly because the #applewatch4 's EKG functionality isn't yet actual functionality.
Thank you @apple for allowing me to participate in today's Apple Distinguished Educator event in #Austin . Also, a big thank you to @JessicaRae929 , who taught me lot today about integrating technology into the curriculum and pedagogy of my classroom. https:// buff.ly/2zm0CZD pic.twitter.com/IkwdjGjF4G

@Apple Need To Make Memoji For All Iphones Not Just The IPhone X
All these years and @apple still has yet to give us a quick and easy way to delete contacts smmfh
@ZacksJerryRig you almost said that this iphone is nothing good.. Thumbs up and don't feel bad when @Apple will not be calling you for their events...
35 more minutes on phone with @VZWSupport got the original #iPhone X back on my account so i have a phone. I guess i put the @apple #iPhoneXSMax back in the box until Engineering decides to call me. @tim_cook #iPhoneFAIL . total support phone time today about 6 hours.
@Apple @AppleSupport I want to formally file a complaint
Should have got a @Huawei phone instead of @apple I guess
Well @Apple I think the people of Birmingham UK have spoken, your time as industry leader is over, No queues for your overpriced and underwhelming rip offs, and I can't say it's not about time too. You had a good run, now move over for more well rounded companies.
The takeaway is to stop falling for the hype and don't buy @Apple
@VZWSupport @verizon For those experiencing Verizon activation errors with new iPhone purchased from @apple , use old zip codes from previous addresses. It is grabbing old information from your Apple ID, not your current Verizon billing zip code #thingsIwishIknew2hoursago
@Apple you suck for not getting my preorder to me today. Why even have preorders?
@Apple the new #iPhone looks dumb

Apple should really put a second usb into the extras that come with the iPhone. Considering the one that comes with it hardly last 6 months @Apple #sortitout
I recently ditched my iPhone for a @oneplus #OnePlus6 . Couldn't be happier and more satisfied.. Looks like will be ditching my MacBook Pro to MSI WS65. @Apple - I think we need some time apart.. Ciao!
Can you please tell me why should I buy new iPhone XS when I already have iPhone X ?? @Apple @AppleSupport @tim_cook
Fuck @Apple
Needed a case! iPhone XS Max is all set up! (at @Apple Bay Street in Emeryville, CA) https://www. swarmapp.com/c/guFsWb2rgp5
Do you know how @Apple made the iPhone XS 15% faster? They just slowed down the iPhone X #iPhoneXS #iPhoneXSMax #Apple #iPhoneX #truth
. @Apple dynamic wallpaper choices are weak. You might as well not even have any.
@Apple iPhone XS unboxing LIVE on my instagram stories so go check me out @kristinabraly
Another iPhone and more #activationissues . Nice job @apple
..what happens when @apple decides a fluctuation in the number of calls and emails is deemed too strange to make a purchase?
why in the world would I ever want to be on do not disturb at a dinner I don't want to be at do appreciate it though @Apple pic.twitter.com/0hOYtehXWV
Ya girl!! Won a iPhone Xs #thankyouSprint #apple @Apple
STILL no detailed explanation on how scores are determined. "number of calls and emails???" Far too vague. In fact its their vagueness causing the FUD. As an old @Apple fan, i'm really starting to hate this company
Here we go! @apple
@Apple make a gavel emoji
Thanks @FedEx for NOT delivering my new @apple iPhone Xs today! Ordered from @verizon last week and it was supposed to be delivered today in New Jersey but this morning it left NJ and got rerouted to NYC with a new delivery date of Monday. #fedexfail @VerizonSupport @FedExHelp
@apple search on settings does not work on iPhone Xs max, works on my iPhone 6s with ios12.
Did iOS 12 just sniff my charge real quick? @Apple
Hello, my name is Corey. I have @Heatonist Hot Sauce and a new @Apple iPhone Xs waiting for me at home. Now you know me.
@Apple @AppleSupport yall need 2 check yall customer service & employers, including managers & maybe retrain them on what great customer care is. Worse experience ever #appleBocaRaton #bocaratonapple #applefail #appleboca #appletowncenter

@Apple big fan of the newest iOS update. much easier to text
Note to self: get the @Apple care. #clumsy
Better not see ppl showing off their new @Apple watches and iPhones if they are making monthly payments on em
No fast charger (as usual.. ..) and now this time, no "dongle".. it's clear that @Apple doesn't give af about it's customers.. regardless of what they lack in their overly expensive products, they know you will still buy.. #iPhoneXS #iPhoneXSMax #iSheep #WakeUp

@Apple why not increase the number of columns on the plus size screens? pic.twitter.com/y1cEQi0l1X
hey @apple , my ibooks isn't syncing across devices because you released ios 12 before releasing macOS 14. How hard is it to release them both at the same time if you're going to require me to update my mac to read.
I need to charge god damn @Samsung i used to complain but at least i got a 48hr battery on the galaxy s8+ thanks everything imce has been garbage n i cant gt my hands on the new note or thnew iphone-xs max @Apple ehttps://youtu.be/HIRrhEnKmNw

Dear @apple , please come out with an app with the ORIGINAL #SkiFree ASAP. Thx. pic.twitter.com/GGkGqDOu7D
@AppleSupport @Apple , it is 2018, WHY can we not find an easier way to remove a forgotten restrictions passcode from a device and enable disabled features and still restore from backup? I have another $1200 phone that I cannot use Siri with. #fail #stopthemadness #fixit #apple
Hey @Apple can you explain why my iPhone 6S is going down since the Keynote? Battery length 1 hour, Forget contact name, slow down and freeze It is not a coincidence... planned obsolescence for sure
Pet peeve: when software/app updates REMOVE features. Latest instance: iOS 12 removing the bluetooth icon from the status bar. Why @Apple @AppleSupport ??
wsh @Apple baissez le prix des Airpods pensez aux pauvres un peu
Never mind @apple . My recording via Voice Memos on iOS12 was received. There was a delay since it was 40+ minutes.
Hey @Apple why do your #memoji all look like #tweens ?? I feel like a #creep using them. How about adding some adult options?
Smh @Apple really had me out here thinking the new iPhone came with Air Pods well played Apple... #whytho pic.twitter.com/MWEd48osc6
@Apple
I updated my iPhone X and now my camera is completely black! WTF @Apple
Stunning. Who would have known a camera on phone could rival a traditional camera industry. Is that the next industry that @Apple will give a run for?

Hey @Apple , my iPhone 7 loses its fully 100% batter in 2 hours. We go from 100%,99%,98%,76%,46%,22%,5%,1%, to dead. Help me out here
Loving the @Apple latest update for iPhone.
Thank you, @tim_cook & @apple for finally adding @googlemaps to #CarPlay
I am BEYOND disgruntled with @apple right now.
Hey @Apple can you guys make IWear a thing? (Eyewear) lol
@Apple you mother fuckers are the devil. My phone starts acting up cause you release a new one!!!! I just got this phone two months ago!!!

THE @Apple WATCH
@Apple I have the best phones ever made through the years.
@Office365 and @Apple could you maybe work on the whole calendar synchronization thing? Sucks.
Be better Siri and @Apple pic.twitter.com/KrXygAM36Y
@Apple y'all need to get it together.
The next @Apple update should include an X-Ray option where we can take a picture and get an X-ray eliminating the need to go to the ER/Doc. I would even pay a fee for each use.. think of the possibilities at sporting events and emergency situations ... or just my house
The next iPhone should add the finger print option on the back of the phone. Just saying. @Apple
How many retweets do i have to get for the new iPhone xs max? @Apple @AppleSupport @AppleMusic
everytime I upgrade my @Apple MacBook, a program/website is no longer compatible

except i can't bc @apple slows down the performance of ppl's phones that haven't updated to the newer software version yet as a passive aggressive tactic to get them to update soooo yep. #conspiracytheory
