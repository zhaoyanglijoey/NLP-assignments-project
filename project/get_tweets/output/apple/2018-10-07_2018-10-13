@Apple your customer service blows.
this is way toooooo fucking annoying. i get a iPhone xs and out of the box, siri doesn't work. iCloud services don't work(except for the store) and i now have to restore. FFS @apple , get your shit together.
I swear @apple know how to get somebody money
@apple and @AppleSupport , Where do I start? First of all my dad has a Apple Watch 2nd Generation Series 1, which the screen broke off of this morning, and having Apple Care (not AppleCare+) makes you pay 199.99 (Plus shipping and tax) is really frustrating...

@Xbox I like this but my problem is the ability of the provider to stop supporting the game that you bought, ala @Apple .

@Apple 's idea is sort of good. I do worry it may escalate a situation unnecessarily by proviking the PoPo because I'm sure you have to point the phone in officer's face. I'd much rather people remain calm &just do what officer says &maybe let the voice record. Thoughts?

@Apple Over 3 months iCloud account blocked, 3 months dealing with AppleCare, over 2 months case with Engineers Dep. and still nothing fixed and account not working. @AppleSupport this is outrageous - I NEED MY ACCOUNT TO WORK

If @apple were smart (and had some spare cash ;) their loaner devices would be a step UP rather than a step DOWN, so you're enticed to buy a new toy, rather than cursing the one you're stuck with while they fix your stuff.
@apple please add this emoji thank you pic.twitter.com/BYsSJgClwY
Went to the @Apple store today, and @AppleSupport replaced my iPhone 7 with a loaner iPhone 6. They wouldn't just swap out the phone. The loaner has only 16GB, so now I'm finding it's almost as useless. They SHOULD be able to afford a suitable replacement loaner.
*shakes fist* My iPhone storage wouldn't be full if @Apple would quit creating all these albums for duplicate pics!
The new Google live wallpapers are absolutely amazing. @Apple what are you doing?
Today totally confirmed why I will NEVER get an iPhone!!!!! @Apple store customer service SUCKS!!!!!!!!!! This foolishness in Pentagon City is NOT worth my time nor my energy!!!!

Does this surprise anyone? Outdated, overpriced equipment. Garbage keyboards on laptops. No innovation like FaceID on Macs. No re-designed iMacs. Mac Pro out of date by 6 years. This is @Apple under @tim_cook .
@Apple still waiting on that crack pipe emoji
The trouble with @Apple #AppStore is that developers wants to charge us monthly subscriptions instead of a steady fee. It's totally abusive ... especially if the app is used once in a while. #applications #iOS #developers
I can't wait for the day I wake up and @Apple triggers a short entry in my forecast model. I don't like to trade emotionally, but when data aligns with fundamentals it's a no brainer unless that cash pile figures out finance is more profitable than patents.

I was expecting it to take a while. It took atleast 45 minutes for the restart, and the background wasn't even reflecting the time of the day correctly. The one thing it was supposed to do. Pointless updates has been a trend with @Apple lately. Dark theme looks good though.
@Apple @AppleSupport the people have spoken
I find it insanely frustrating that @apple has no problem selling on demand a pair of faulty headphones and then makes me schedule a damn appointment to beg them to take them from me for a week or more to get what I paid for. Your customer service leaves much to be desired.

@Apple Hey Apple, it would be really cool if I could click the phone number(right above the text) in a text message and save a new number from there, rather than having to remember which number is which and clicking the list of numbers! Just a thought I wanted to share bc I care!
I really wanted to like the Pixel 2 and 3, but I just don't. Please stop following in @Apple 's footsteps with the notch. Do your own thing and be different. We're in a time where 90% of the time, you can't tell what phone a person has with a glimpse. Make your phone unique.

I told my daughter that the @apple pencil was a waste of money, and that she could have mine. She then sends me what she did with it on day one, and I realized that my digital doodles were probably not a fair assessment of the tool. pic.twitter.com/INIlWRVdNr

HEY @Apple CAN YALL PLEASE MAKE IT SO THE FUCKING GPS SHUTS THE FUCK UP WHEN IM DRIVING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC. JUST A SIMPLE DING WITH THE DIRECTION ARROW WILL SUFFICE (like when on a phone call) THIS BITCH WONT SHUT THE FUCK UP DURING MY FAVE LINES AND IM OVER IT.

Srsly, @tim_cook ?! THIS is what you want @Apple to be known for now? Steve is so ashamed of you right now...
@Apple : According to Kanye West, you are building an all hydrogen airplane for @realDonaldTrump as a new Air Force 1. Can you confirm this?
@Apple 144.178.0.0/19 (Part of AS714) whois requests are coming back from RIPE causing GeoLocation issues with @Google . Looks like 144.176.0.0/14 was transferred to RIPe from ARIN, the the block was picked up by Apple..? Do what this what you will.
@Apple and @Android should not allow such combinations. Also, America should not allow those two loons in the White House.

@apple @AppleSupport why have I got to do the MOOOOOOOST just to flip the camera on FaceTime????
@jaketapper : Some of the responses are disputing some of the @Apple tech features part of the story.
2day executive relation said best course is to put back 10.13 and shipping back. No word on a fix - Seriously, what's going on. @Apple should step in and swap this literally brand new laptop - $3k well spent?
@9to5mac @Apple Quite disappointed-3 months old MB15 & Movaje created WiFi issue. It toggles ON/OFF itself and wouldn't connect. Spent numerous hours with Apple advance and store support, sent it to Apple for further testing.

Dear @apple , stop being stupid. Bring back MagSafe connectors!!
This is unbelievable! #Khashoggi paired his @Apple watch with his phone be4 entering the #Saudi consulate & the audio was recovered from his Iphone outside by Turkish security services! My Gear watch deconnects after 15 meters! What a range this Apple gear has! #JamalKhashoggi
@Apple hey how about you jerks stop slowing phones down just to drive a profit. Your product quality sucks
Dear @FCC & @AjitPaiFCC , ISPs are "communication services" no different than the landline phone monopolies of yesteryear. Companies like @Twitter , @Google , @Netflix , @Microsoft , @Apple are all examples of "information services" that rely on "communication services" to exist.
Look. Idk if its @Google @YouTube @android @apple @federalreserve or @asurion but my phone is bugging the fuck out its moving by its self !

@Apple we really need a feature to record calls, can help with many things like if some threats are made they can be sent to the police and a lot of people use calls when they are out alone at night etc. Or at least allow screen recording to pick the audio up

Hey @Apple we need to get cross platform on the Apple TV multicast so I can get the baseball game on too.
(2/2) However, when I unplug the cable, flip it over and plug it back in, it begins to charge. I use the lightning cable and adapter that Apple gives you in the box with all new iPhones, and I only use @Apple cords. #ChargeGate #iPhoneXS
@Apple wiped out my entire computer when I called them about a bad cookie pop up. I cursed out a supervisor when he said I could have gotten it all back but you didn't put in the security code for the cloud keychain - uh? Who knew.
my charger only works at a certain angle and now the exposed cord is sparking at me lmao @Apple your products are crap and your customer service is even worse
I need a WiFi emoji @Apple
@apple lol
@Apple Needs to get their act together. Brand new XS Max and all my calls keep dropping. Something I didn't experience on my 6s Plus. A refund might be in order. @AppleSupport

Gotta say, the help that I received in the @Apple store today was top class. Not pushing product but instead helping me what I really needed. Which I got the name of the guy helping me, he deserves a pat on the back

Until you need your @Apple device repaired and they say it's due to water damage when in fact it's just a bent pin and free fix from a repair place, instead Apple want you to spend $1000+ on a replacement, no Apple crap for me thanks

can we get that low battery reminder at like 60 instead of 20 @Apple
maaaan what the fuck @apple pic.twitter.com/ZpMb1BTS9V
Never buy a new iphone as soon as its launched, wait at least 2 months for not getting shittiest phones . @Apple

I will be trading my POS @LGUS phone for either an @Samsung or a @Apple phone. Your devices are horrible with the apps. Can't even get it to work with Panama.
Finally here (at @Apple Markville Shopping Centre in Markham, ON) https://www. swarmapp.com/c/cUY6AKuxeSp
@Apple
I'm running away from home.. That reminds me who drank all the fucking milk? Bring some back when you miss your @Windows @Xbox @PlayStation @Google fucking @Apple @SamsungUK cotton life. And don't expect me to come fucking looking for you. I'm tired and my feet hurt from work.
@Apple wish we could get an #AppleStore in our area #ccoutletsbythebay #OCC #OutletsCorpusChristi
@Apple You need to do something about these robo call about #icloud accounts. Got 6 calls within an hour.
lol @Apple you have got to be kidding me! I've had this phone for less than 24 hours. I make ONE phone call and the black surface actually rubs off on my hand and you refuse take care of it because this is something I did?!?! What a joke! Thankfully @ATT took care of it pic.twitter.com/vak46JsFra
Holy flying fuck @Apple @HP @HPSupport guess what? #mojave bricked my printer's install software, I can't print shit, check it out then please help lol! pic.twitter.com/EIWivHc0RX
As of Q1 2018, there were 3.8 million apps available in the @GooglePlayDev and 2 million available in the @AppStore . So how do you make your #mobileapp stand out?

I'm at @Apple Brandon in Brandon, FL https://www. swarmapp.com/c/3PI9lhs72nU
After installing your latest iOS beta update two days ago, this is what happens when I touch any of the notifications. This is crap. Fix this @AppleSupport @apple pic.twitter.com/4xZ4wrcSGi
@TeamYouTube I love 60fps sports on @YouTubeTV but watching on my @Apple TV causes the frame rate and resolution to go between high and low every 30 seconds. Works just fine on my @Xbox One X. Obvious is just watch on Xbox, but when will AppleTV be fixed?
I'm at @Apple Crossgates in Albany, NY https://www. swarmapp.com/c/3FEvJQrmXN5
What is going on with @apple iPhones??? It's seems that multiple people are experiencing call drops. After 1-2 minutes on the line! @AppleSupport Am I the only person experiencing this???
Anyone want to start a class action suit against @apple ?
@Apple , if you read this, we want FIDO2 on iOS! Please open up NFC by allowing writes, so that apps and security keys can implement the FIDO2 standard on iOS. #FIDO2iOS #SoloKickstarter https:// solokeys.com/kickstarter
Hey @apple , your MLB data is incorrect. #Siri is telling me that Brewers don't play today and that the last game they played was on September 30th vs the Tigers.
We're tired of waiting for our app launch & we know you are too! C'mon @Apple & @GooglePlay Get us verified & let the people play! Thanks to everyone for their continued support & for joining in with our fun games in the mean time! We are 100% launching soon... ish pic.twitter.com/F7dvm0BKIC
Thank you @apple for Code with Kids! pic.twitter.com/mXlfpPAtlX
I just love the creativity with which people take on each other on these things (e.g. "ingenius" from @SamsungMobile ) As long as it's respectful and friendly, I love having these discussions. And I must say @Apple has been producing quite some joke material to work with lately.
hello @apple , why would you want to ship your products with @fedex ; a company that still ships shark fin? @UPS seems like a better fit.
. @Apple are a #FedEx customer Why not change to @UPS a brand not linked to animal slaughter? #BoycottFedEx pic.twitter.com/scbVCGbXiD
Also push @amazon , @Google @apple to remove @nratv from their platform. That should shake up the @NRA a bit :)
Tried everything for the last half hour to rent a film through @Apple @AppleitunesUK and couldn't... Rent button is disabled and nobody in the world knows why. How they make their money, I do not know...
Bye bye @Apple hello @Samsung sksk
Apparently all I needed to do to get my antique @apple airport express working was leave it wedged between a wall and the shelf for nine months. Who knew.
Thanks for fixing the keyboard @Apple

We can remember the big issue between the @cia , @fbi and @apple when the security found an iphone for a terrorist. Apple refused to create a program to unlock the iPhone at that time for security reasons of the user worldwide.
