Ha how petty and pathetic can @Apple get. Putting an event on to supposedly "overshadow" One Plus is ridiculous. One Plus make better phones so clearly there's a bit of jealousy there.
NEWS FLASH!!! Attention @Apple users: DO NOT 'upgrade' to MOJAVE; IT STINKS! Website won't open unless you diasble java script and your Apple Mouse won't stay connected! WORST; the only way to go back is to ERASE YOUR HARD DRIVE! Apple Support is USELESS! #JustSayin ' That is all.
If @apple really wants to put an end to jail breaking. Then they should allow people to customize their iPhones. #Facts

I think it's ridiculous @apple #iPhone default behavior is NOT low-power mode. Just caught my phone at 30% and I'm like 'why am I not on low power mode!?!' At least prompt me at 50%! Yes, I know, they want me to just upgrade...
I NEED @CorelPainter to function on @Apple Mojave! It is completely unfair to force people to repurchase a perfectly fine product just because of a coding. Stupid tech is a drain on society. I will update when I want to! Nothing newly exciting in PE6 it's the same as PE5.
Can we get #spotify app on the appletv @apple ? at least my chromecast does the job
@Apple I changed my contact to a lock bar and asked Siri my name and my phone exploded
PSA: when you get your computer back from @Apple make sure you check the specs. I had a logic board repair that got downgraded from a core i7 to i5 and from 16 GB of RAM to 8. Most people wouldn't have bothered to check.
Really hoping that the @apple iPad event at the end of the month intros an iPad Mini 5. I'd like to upgrade from my iPad Mini 2.

@apple the iPhone restore process is rather horrible. Download update for iTunes (was already fully up to date) restart, can't restore from backup because I need to update the iPhone I just bought. Which is what I was trying to do when I had to restart iTunes to install crap

@AppleMusic @AppleSupport @Apple learn from this!?
@Apple when the wireless airpod case coming ??
updated my ios and whatdoyaknow i already regret it. battery life is much lower and i now have bugs in various apps including music and settings(?????) this why i never update lol why fix if it isnt broken @apple
Since #Siri hasn't at all developed, and the world is in expectance of @google #Duplex , #Maps surpassed @apple Maps it leads to the assumption the #Pixel might outreach the #iPhone one day.
It's 1 AM, hello late night salt. I feel like I have cracked the case of the century after building a DIY Faraday cage with aluminum foil for my USB-C adaptor to solve the interferences it was having with the WiFi. Thanks physics, thanks Faraday. No thanks for you today @Apple .
Just patiently waiting for the next gen AirPods @apple
I like the new update of MacBook #MacOSMojava @Apple
Thank you! We sure are and @Apple too
You should be able to add a contact to your iPhone but have an expiration on it. Like, I need to know who you are now, but not next week. @Apple
Hey @Apple thanks to all of your coders and team members who get #Siri to work. Thanks to you I am able to text with my mom who has been blind all my life.
Nice one @Apple . I currently can't log into https://www. icloud.com because you have forced me into an "Update you Apple ID" screen which infintely loops... Hint: I don't want to update my Apple ID, it's fine how it is! cc: @AppleSupport
Never got delivery you didn't provide right address to @FedEx Called your shipping dept, spoke with rude rep called Lauren, told me it will take 3 to 4 business days to get my address updated, (when my package is inside the truck today) Now I know why people choose @Apple
That feeling when @freedomsupport and @motorola give you different answers about your @android update and neither one can tell you for certain what software version your device should be running. Might be time to bite the bullet and go @Apple on @TELUS #MotoZ2Play
@Apple be getting all of us on for money lol
@Apple !
@Apple @AppleSupport updated the new mac Mojave into my iMac and the problem arises when after I login in for 5 sec it keeps bringing me back to the login screen. #mojaveproblems
@AppleSupport any idea how long it might take your engineers to get the servers back up? it's been hours @apple
@Apple @AppleSupport I think your iCloud is broken

@Apple @TimCook The fact that I had to BUY an adapter for my new MacBookPro, for USB ports for equipment I use with my computer is a very poor business practice, not that you will even care.

Okay @Apple . I just walked for an hour, over 2 miles, which my watch tracked the entire time. How is it I only have 15 minutes of exercise in my ring?
Dear @apple You know how there's that button in group messages in iMessage called "Hide Alerts"? Sure would be nice if that really did Hide Alerts when I select that option.
i did find out that @apple #icloud has been down for several hours.
@Apple you're the worst company on the planet.

So my @Apple Watch just cracked all the way around the screen for no reason, it's only three weeks old. Apple refuse to replace it even though it's against the law in my country. I didn't take any pictures before delivering the watch, but here's one Apple sent me of it. pic.twitter.com/HcVtUnj96M

@AppleSupport Bought an Apple watch and I cannot unlock the mac. I did all the steps. I was able before but not now. Very very fragile. It looks more Microsoft than an @Apple product
@Apple I was asking Siri when was my birthday and it glitched up and started spamming that I have to unlock my iPhone first while my iPhone was already unlocked weird. This was on iOS 12.0.1.

@Apple as much as I loved you, you are finished! #SteveJobs would never have allowed the 10XS to be released. The notch, Siri is extremely behind the times and your laziness to do anything actually game changing is ridiculous! I think I maybe leaving the ecosystem next upgrade!
Can we get Group FaceTime already??? Holiday season is rapidly approaching @Apple @tim_cook

@Apple so your phones are listening devices for foreign intel agencies? I thought they were hacker proof?
Always great customer service at @Apple but what are you doing to your phone to keep needing to get it fixed?!
I keep hearing from #AppleFanBois (and @TimCook ) how secure iPhones are. How is it that all the capability of our intelligence infrastructure cannot keep the Chinese and the Russians out of @realDonaldTrump 's @Apple phone?

Beware barrage of #phishing emails claiming you just logged into an unknown notebook or laptop for your APPLE ACCOUNT @Apple
3) got the iPhone Xs Max... totally worth it, don't miss the home button at all. 4) while waiting for @Apple to release the Dual SIM update, I was back to two phone...of which I lost the work one (and old iPhone SE as I was only using it for calls and texts.
@Apple I wish I could title my screenshots so then I could maneuver back to them with ease
Hope @Apple knows about that causes #AppleWatchSeries4 to restart when scrolling thru watch faces. But otherwise love it.
I'd be happy if apple would crack down on hackers who steal our data and make purchases from our accounts. You have their addresses, @Apple so why dont you go after them?
What this tells me is that @apple isn't much different from Google, Facebook, etc...they're trying to monetize every click and using dark UX patterns to do so
