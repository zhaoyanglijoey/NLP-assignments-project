@thebeatles Can I have your follow?
This is really sad. It really shows how bad the state of music really is when we can have a mediocre rapper like @Drake who sounds like he is bored rapping his own music populating the charts and beating records set by the @thebeatles who actually wrote and played their own music
RT if you would love @thebeatles to follow you
I will never tire of the melodious sounds of @thebeatles at OPACY.
My two faves go with me everywhere on my keys @thebeatles @mitchgrassi @SUP3RFRUIT pic.twitter.com/pw4hBbykXt
