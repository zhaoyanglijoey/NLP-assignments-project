Hey @thebeatles , I love you.
Last few days whilst painting and decorating my home, I've been listening to the entire @thebeatles discography in chronological order. Pretty wondrous stuff. Currently on Past Masters Volumes 1 and 2.
Once again tonight I discovered that if you love @thebeatles everyone is your friend @PaulMcCartney #beatles

@siriusxmvolume my pick for new music Friday is from the new @carlbroemel (of @mymorningjacket ) album, Wished Out. Either the title track, or Starting From Scratch. Great album from a great musician. May be biased because MMJ is my favorite band, other than @thebeatles .
