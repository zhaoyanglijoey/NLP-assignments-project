ICYMI: Truly nothing like seeing @RobZombie & @marilynmanson covering @thebeatles ' "Helter Skelter" while the screens behind them are filled with images of Charles Manson and his family. Here's my @azcentral review with awesome photographs by Jim Louvau. https:// bit.ly/2MxwkLQ

Loved your interview with @HowardStern ! You are such a great caretaker of the @thebeatles history and story. How do you stay patient with years of endless questions about, "who wrote this one?" or "What was this song about?" questions. PS please come to SF again, we love you!

#EgyptStation @PaulMcCartney . Did you ever think that @thebeatles and even all your solo material would still be popular today? Even with the younger generations?

My 2 favorite bands @BTS_twt & @thebeatles .Both giving in their music a message about love"all you need is love" & self love "I'm the one I should love in this world" isn't beautiful @ringostarrmusic & @PaulMcCartney that music can make a change in this broken world? The is LOVE
We already knew the @thebeatles jerked off together, that's what Revolution 9 WAS.
Reading, for the trillionth time, the late, great Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head. He's so right about some @thebeatles songs, yet SO wrong about others: Day Tripper, genuinely revolutionary, is effectively dismissed. "It isn't very interesting" is positively Chistgau-like

In Praise of @thebeatles they had already had over 1,500 million sales Worldwide in the 20th Century & all (except for 1 small exception) were actually recorded between 37 & 55 years earlier than 2000 / 2018 yet they still outsold everyone but Eminem in the US.
