Thank you @Beat_Bugs having my kids ask to listen to @thebeatles songs when they want to dance around the living room on a cold day warms my heart
A mi me sigue mi banda favorita en Twitter @thebeatles

According to #CordandTish taking care of business is a @thebeatles song! You guys and facts are hilarious! This should be trending!

Listening to the @SIRIUSXM @thebeatles countdown. @PaulMcCartney wrote Blackbird in 1968 during the height of the Civil Rights movement. May you be our Blackbird in 2018 @staceyabrams . https:// youtu.be/9l5L34VqzlU
Started 2018 in the past. #BeatlesforSale and #RubberSoul . Surely pop music at its very best? @thebeatles played through @AppleMusic on my new @beoplay A1. Can the year get any better?
I'm glad to see Daft Punk up there but what about #Rain by @thebeatles ?
I am over the moon that @GibbBarry & @ringostarrmusic have been knighted. #NewYearsHonoursList It is hard to imagine a world without @BeeGees or @thebeatles Their music has been the soundtrack to so many of our lives.
Watching 8 Days A Week, the Beatles documentary directed by Ron Howard. @thebeatles
@RealRonHoward Just saw #Eightdaysaweek shows how good @GeorgeHarrison and @ringostarrmusic were live. Sometimes we forget that. @thebeatles
33.45.78 #nowplaying @thebeatles - Taxman - 1966 #vinyl #records #lps #45s live @CIUT895FM
33.45.78 #nowplaying @thebeatles - Bad Boy - 1965 #vinyl #records #lps #45s live @CIUT895FM
So @Spotify served up Hello, Goodbye by @thebeatles as the first song played in our house in 2018 and it was pretty much perfection
@BeatlesOfCourse @thebeatles sad to hear of the passing of R Gary Patterson(2017). I've read countless Beatles books, but my favorite is his "The Walrus Was Paul". EVERY line has a 'clue' and I still enjoy it to this day. Suggested read for any #beatlemaniac . You will enjoy it!
