What a difference a day makes. On Aug. 15, 1962, Pete Best was the original drummer for The Beatles. The next day, he was fired and went from THE PETE BEST to, well, just Pete Best, the guy in the red shirt. Bummer. @thebeatles pic.twitter.com/v3Ny9QlByP
A lot of people forget that he was also in The @thebeatles

@taylorswift13 @thebeatles and @stormzy got me through my A Level media. Now I have the knowledge of these 3 for my future.
After an exciting but steady diet of The @thebeatles and Motown (S Robinson, S Wonder, M Gaye), when I bought my first Aretha album, Lady Soul, it was as if another curtain had been lifted and I went to a whole new place. Only one person ever sang the way Aretha sang. R.I.P.
TODAY N HISTORY 1954 @SportsIllustrated is first published by @TimeInc 1962 @TheBeatles fire their first drummer Pete Best & replace him with @RingoStarr 1977 @ElvisPresley dies at his Graceland estate in Memphis, at age 42
so bloke in office doesn't know who Aretha Franklin is. He only got 3 of the @thebeatles he plays video games and is impervious to Western Culture
