Got into a discussion of the post-Beatles music today. I'll say who my fave is after the poll is over. In the meantime, who made the best music as a solo artist? @thebeatles #johnlennon #PaulMcCartney #georgeharrison #ringostarr @JacketAudio @JacketTMac @jdcam01 #podcast
this weekend marks the 50th anniversary of the release of the @TheBeatles classic Hey Jude as a single and the film Rachel Rachel in Theaters
I would put all 7 seasons of #GameofThrones , all seasons of #TheBigBangTheory , all 8 @starwars movies. All 3 seasons of @StarTrek the original series. And for musical entertainment, #ABBA Greatest Hits, and as much of @thebeatles catalog as I can fit. #GalaxyNote9 #contest
