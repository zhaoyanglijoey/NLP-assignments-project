It's 2018 and @thebeatles still haven't put a full HD version of the rooftop performance on YouTube.
Every weekday I pass twice in front of this remodeled building. Well this was the Washington Coliseum where in 1964 the @thebeatles held their first US concert. https:// vimeo.com/135623866 . Calloni is also Culture! pic.twitter.com/NwMGETW6H0
The thing I hate most in this world other than the devil is that I will never be able to see @thebeatles live...ever
