. @POTUS is making @thebeatles ' songs come true and a former Beatle can't stand it, @PaulMcCartney called him a "Mad Captain" well someone had to drive the "Yellow Submarine" to take us to the "Octopus Garden."

. @Drake spends his 49th career week at No. 1 on the #Hot100 . Among all acts in the #Hot100 's 60-year history, Drake trails only @MariahCarey (79 weeks at No. 1), @rihanna (60), @thebeatles (59) and @BoyzIIMen (50).
. @PaulMcCartney abandoned the option of being the "Walrus" and now he's more of the "Mad Captain" wrecking the legacy of @thebeatles ' "Yellow Submarine."

@siriusxmvolume my pick for new music Friday is from the new @carlbroemel (of @mymorningjacket ) album, Wished Out. Either the title track, or Starting From Scratch. Great album from a great musician. May be biased because MMJ is my favorite band, other than @thebeatles .
