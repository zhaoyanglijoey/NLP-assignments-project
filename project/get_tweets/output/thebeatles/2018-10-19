'Kay so,,,, @thebeatles released three new versions of While My Guitar Gently Weeps on Youtube and I gotta say, the acoustic one got me crying like a baby. I miss @GeorgeHarrison so much
A special gift for all @thebeatles fans. https:// hypb.st/r8jez
I'm at final rehearsals for choir concert tomorrow and one of the groups just sang 'Golden Slumbers', I wanted to cry I was so happy that they were singing my favorite song!! I was the only one quietly singing along haha @thebeatles
@thebeatles buenisima banda, pero son eternos segundones
Creo que no has escuchado a @thebeatles

@thebeatles pathetic........... You wish....... You'll never get in..........
I measure maturity by your favorite @thebeatles artist. Is it @PaulMcCartney ? You're probably a love-lust teen-mind. @johnlennon ? 20's knows everything, can change the world. @GeorgeHarrison ? 30-40's quiet, smart, just doing his thing. Sorry @ringostarrmusic , nobody likes Ringo.
Here comes old flat top @thebeatles
Just covered a popular track by @thebeatles ! Will be uploaded soon! #1965
We've got more previews of @thebeatles White Album anniversary release. @andregardner must be going nuts right now (in a good way). https:// bit.ly/2J6oHqJ
THE BEATLES - BIRTHDAY http:// rdo.to/WGWE #nowplaying #listenlive @thebeatles
I need to start building up my own music collection. I'm just gonna list some albums I need to buy so I have my own copies. Every @thebeatles album @QueenWillRock Greatest Hits I, II, & III Pet Sounds Thriller The @ninjasexparty albums I don't have Every @RealTenaciousD album
Great news. Red rose Speedway was the nearest @PaulMcCartney release to my birthdate. Grown up loving #Wings and Paul's solo stuff before I even really knew about @thebeatles :D
As if it wasn't already an expensive fall season for @thebeatles fans, now @PaulMcCartney has not one but TWO new deluxe editions on the way! Here comes "Wild Life" and "Red Rose Speedway"! https:// youtu.be/NfLjprd0xxg
