I love watching the @TheCrownNetflix . I've seen it all the way through more times than I should probably admit. One question: How did you all ever survive before @thebeatles and the @RollingStones ?

I've been listening to @thebeatles throughout the day today (I'm a casual fan of theirs) and I just heard the song "Run For Your Life" for the first time. Yeesh. Very disturbing song about domestic violence. Didn't expect a song like that from them.
