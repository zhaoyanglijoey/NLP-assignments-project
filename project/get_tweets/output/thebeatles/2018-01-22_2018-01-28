@BrianWilsonLive Brian, I liked your tribute to @thebeatles producer George Martin that appeared in Time magazine.
@JonesysJukebox Kajagoo-goo [phonetic] of 1983 #USArmedForcesRadio #hitparade , #BerlinGermany , is to #BoyGeorge what the #DaveClarkFive was to @thebeatles in 1964. #contemporaneousbesties this SF Bay Area resident growing up.
#DaveClark5 were contemporaries and they were both my favorites. Maybe at one point I liked the DC5 single more than @thebeatles , but like @RollingStones , had a bigger arsenal touring. Then when DC5 faded, the beatles didn't have to tour. "There can only be one." @JonesysJukebox
