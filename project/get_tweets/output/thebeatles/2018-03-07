#TheBeatles ubiquity means that I don't listen to their full albums very often, especially the early ones. But I really should. After all, they are The freaking @thebeatles after all. Thank you @PaulMcCartney and @ringostarrmusic .
Listening "You're Going To Lose That Girl" from @thebeatles on @885fmsocal made my day. http:// 885fm.org/listen/ #TheBeatles #Help ! pic.twitter.com/5dd36F5gVN
MARCH 7 2018 - Not sure who set up the second image but it is very clever. The first image by Robert Freeman is from 1963 and the second is a montage from 1967. The two pictures tell the story ... @thebeatles went through incredible changes. pic.twitter.com/bAGJpqXck1
#OnThisDayInMusic : In 2015, @Drake placed an astounding 14 songs in the #Hot100 , thanks to the release of his #mixtape "If You're Reading This It's Too Late." @thebeatles are the only other act to accomplish this, with 14 songs on the tally for a week in April 1964.
