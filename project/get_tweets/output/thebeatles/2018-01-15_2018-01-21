I never realized how much The Moody Blues were channeling @thebeatles vibes on this album while still making their own sound. Also, The Sun Set/Twilight Time is the most badass and underrated track on here imho
100 years later to the day, Leadbelly and fellow @CapitolRecords artists @TheBeachBoys , @thebeatles , and Les Paul were inducted into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall Of Fame.
Gig recap: Learned about colors, talked about @thebeatles , broke a drum head, broke a guitar string, sold merch, body hurts. I am so blessed.
