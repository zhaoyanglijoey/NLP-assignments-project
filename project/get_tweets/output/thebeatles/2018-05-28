1968 wasn't all bad for me. My mother bought me @thebeatles ' White Album the day it was released. This is one of my best memories ever. #BeatlesGuterman #GutermanMemories #1968CNN

I am volunteering at @AROTR , a @thebeatles Festival and thought I saw @Marina_Sirtis . It was not her, which I knew when she was buying a shirt from me. I showed her a photo and she was flattered.

How about "Old Brown Shoe" by @thebeatles then?
Being that #1968 is trending, may I add being completely blown away by @TheBeatles and Hey Jude and wishing very much I was a part of the audience who sang with them at the Frost taping. The coda? Still the greatest thing ever. Well, that and Pepper.
