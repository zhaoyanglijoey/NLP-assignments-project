I was fortunate to catch Randy and Tal's concert @Beatles_Fest last Sunday night in Jersey City & really enjoyed the new track "Between Two Mountains", along with their FAB version of @thebeatles ' A Hard Day's Night complete with that famous (& difficult) opening chord !
I think @thebeatles & @NKOTB are tied for 1st in my eyes. My mom experienced Beatlemania & I am Still experiencing @NKOTB madness. What is the term for us Crazy Blockheads?
