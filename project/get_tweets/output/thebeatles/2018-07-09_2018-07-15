@thebeatles Can I have your follow?
This is really sad. It really shows how bad the state of music really is when we can have a mediocre rapper like @Drake who sounds like he is bored rapping his own music populating the charts and beating records set by the @thebeatles who actually wrote and played their own music
RT if you would love @thebeatles to follow you
I will never tire of the melodious sounds of @thebeatles at OPACY.

So seems @Drake really is bigger than @thebeatles Beatles. 7 of the top 10 on @billboard are from @Drake . @thebeatles only had 5. That is saying a lot because @thebeatles are awesome :)
My 5 yr old is arguing with me about @thebeatles Eleanor Rigby lyrics. What a fantastic day! #parentingwin !
@drizzy broke the @thebeatles record for holding the most singles on a chart! Go @Drake ! pic.twitter.com/VvfXSuNdvh
@mashupmartin Please include a Dear Prudence version without the jet sound at the very beginning, only the clean guitars. All this in the 50th White Album anniversary. @yokoono @AbbeyRoad @thebeatles @PaulMcCartney

Simple disclaimer: I am a huge @thebeatles fan too, so no offense meant.
To continue this train of thought. @aha_com 's Take On Me on @Spotify has nearly as many plays as @billboard 's Top 5, Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs Combined... And, more plays than any @thebeatles song #Impressed

The big screen rerelease of @thebeatles #YellowSubmarine is incredible + shows the music, animation, writing and voice acting are all equally as good. Rarely get the sense of rediscovering a film I've seen so much but the 50th anniversary screening did the trick... #TheBeatles pic.twitter.com/cPeQa9iBWA

Olha Ringo.... Lindo ehm?? https:// youtu.be/w62zGC-JlY8 @picsxringo @thebeatles @SeanOnoLennon @JulianLennon @yokoono
@malcotheatres @thebeatles I understand that F'ville probably gets more business than Ft Smith, but why did I have to pay $2 more a ticket to see Yellow Submarine in Ft Smith than my friends had to pay in F'ville? $14 vs. $12 a ticket. Seems wrong and bad form Malco.

Of course @BetoORourke would do a @thebeatles reference, he's the hippest & coolest candidate ever. Plus smart, charming, dedicated, passionate about what's important to Texans. #BetoForTexas #FlipTheSenate #FlipTexasBlue pic.twitter.com/n7lDXP54ox
In all of music history this may be THE perfect song. With horns, strings, a drum solo by @ringostarrmusic and a bass note you'll feel in your chest. @PaulMcCartney @thebeatles pic.twitter.com/dQ7NuLf0BT
