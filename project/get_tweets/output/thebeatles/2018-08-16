That song, House Burning Down, and @thebeatles Day Tripper changed my life forever! I knew I was destined to be a guitarist as my living. Thank you Jimi, friends & family, for your incredible gift to the Universe. You changed us forever. GBell Dave pic.twitter.com/HxrJQwbqqy

@thebeatles changed the music industry forever, both radically in studio recording and production and exponentionally in the reception and treatment of popular music celebrities #fightme
This Date in Music: @TheMonkees release their #1 US @billboard 100 hit single, "Last Train To Clarksville" in 1966. The song was inspired by @thebeatles hit "Paperback Writer". #TheSession @955KLOS https:// youtu.be/o4FIu4Xj16I https:// youtu.be/o4FIu4Xj16I
My first Aretha album which I won from a radio station contest & contained her rendition of @thebeatles Let it Be...she transformed it into her own creation. One example of what made her an awesome artist. Today the world lost a great voice...But, "The Queen of Soul" lives on! pic.twitter.com/cKYEkHb8Je

THE BEATLES - BIRTHDAY http:// rdo.to/WGWE #nowplaying #listenlive @thebeatles
I wanna hold your hand by @thebeatles
What a difference a day makes. On Aug. 15, 1962, Pete Best was the original drummer for The Beatles. The next day, he was fired and went from THE PETE BEST to, well, just Pete Best, the guy in the red shirt. Bummer. @thebeatles pic.twitter.com/v3Ny9QlByP
A lot of people forget that he was also in The @thebeatles
A look back at that time @TheBeatles made room for Ringo ... https:// trib.al/2YVg9hs

"Love Is All You Need" leads me to believe that @thebeatles were not very good at tennis. #ThursdayThoughts
@taylorswift13 @thebeatles and @stormzy got me through my A Level media. Now I have the knowledge of these 3 for my future.
After an exciting but steady diet of The @thebeatles and Motown (S Robinson, S Wonder, M Gaye), when I bought my first Aretha album, Lady Soul, it was as if another curtain had been lifted and I went to a whole new place. Only one person ever sang the way Aretha sang. R.I.P.
TODAY N HISTORY 1954 @SportsIllustrated is first published by @TimeInc 1962 @TheBeatles fire their first drummer Pete Best & replace him with @RingoStarr 1977 @ElvisPresley dies at his Graceland estate in Memphis, at age 42
so bloke in office doesn't know who Aretha Franklin is. He only got 3 of the @thebeatles he plays video games and is impervious to Western Culture
I'm sure glad you joined @@thebeatles ! You all have had a positive impact on my life. Peace and love @ringostarrmusic

Also on Aug 16 - Pete Best is let go by @TheBeatles in 1962 and replaced two days later by Ringo Starr. It was said that the only difference between Pete's drumming and a vacuum cleaner is that you have to plug in a vacuum cleaner for it to suck.

We are as many years now from "Nevermind" as it was from @thebeatles on Ed Sullivan; we are as far from "Appetite for Destruction" now as it was from the earliest hits of Elvis
