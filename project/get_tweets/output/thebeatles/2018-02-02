For Flashback Friday here are a couple of photos of my Great-Granddad standing in the doorway of the Royal Court Hotel, Sloane Square. He was the Hotel's General Manager between 1930 and 1965. On the left is the day @thebeatles visited the hotel on 10th February 1963. #TheBeatles pic.twitter.com/ACqESOIAyc

A great day for some @thebeatles music. Thanks for all the great music pic.twitter.com/ATNgdQ4YOd
