Today is a good day! Getting lots of work done for my shop. I'm sewing some plush while singing along to @thebeatles songs. Current plush being worked on are some mini Krakens (foam filled bodies & weighted tentacles) & some Mandrakes. #actuallyautistic #stimtoys
#MarchMadness and the @thebeatles are the two most overrated things ever.

The @SIRIUSXM Beatles channel should have a show that's all other bands doing really, really bad versions of @thebeatles songs. It would be called The Butcher Covers. #beatles #thebeatles
