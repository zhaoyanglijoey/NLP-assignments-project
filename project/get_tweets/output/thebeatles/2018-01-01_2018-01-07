Listening to the @SIRIUSXM @thebeatles countdown. @PaulMcCartney wrote Blackbird in 1968 during the height of the Civil Rights movement. May you be our Blackbird in 2018 @staceyabrams . https:// youtu.be/9l5L34VqzlU
Started 2018 in the past. #BeatlesforSale and #RubberSoul . Surely pop music at its very best? @thebeatles played through @AppleMusic on my new @beoplay A1. Can the year get any better?
I'm glad to see Daft Punk up there but what about #Rain by @thebeatles ?
I am over the moon that @GibbBarry & @ringostarrmusic have been knighted. #NewYearsHonoursList It is hard to imagine a world without @BeeGees or @thebeatles Their music has been the soundtrack to so many of our lives.
Watching 8 Days A Week, the Beatles documentary directed by Ron Howard. @thebeatles
@RealRonHoward Just saw #Eightdaysaweek shows how good @GeorgeHarrison and @ringostarrmusic were live. Sometimes we forget that. @thebeatles

So @Spotify served up Hello, Goodbye by @thebeatles as the first song played in our house in 2018 and it was pretty much perfection
@BeatlesOfCourse @thebeatles sad to hear of the passing of R Gary Patterson(2017). I've read countless Beatles books, but my favorite is his "The Walrus Was Paul". EVERY line has a 'clue' and I still enjoy it to this day. Suggested read for any #beatlemaniac . You will enjoy it!

Together for a mere ten years, @thebeatles led a musical revolution that radically transformed the sound and significance of rock & roll.

My first favourite band. Feel so lucky and privileged to have lived through @theBeatles in the *1960s* . #8daysaweek . Great watch
Last nights documentary is a must for any @thebeatles fans some brilliant footage of the band #eightdaysaweek
And went - VERY DRUNK - to see @thebeatles ' @Cirque show. Which was AMAZING. So much so that one of the acrobatic stunts made me gasp SO hard I started to choke. ... And out flew that piece of undigested ginger, right into the hair of the lady in front.
