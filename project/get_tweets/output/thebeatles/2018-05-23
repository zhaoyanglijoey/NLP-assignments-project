Honestly, I like everything, from @thebeatles to @philipglass . Though I must say I am rather fond of John Cage
This whole who's the biggest boy band thing is silly. Everyone knows that title went to the @thebeatles ages ago lol
haunted Yesterday they run screaming through the streets while we hide from them I'm not from there, but the first thing that popped into my head was British girls chasing @thebeatles . Thanks for the pass, 17. How about you, @juderoy29 ?

Would love if you take a look into @BTS_twt , their music, their lyrics and their fandom. The similarities to @thebeatles ; the differences. I love both groups. Couldn't experience the BEATLEMANIA myself of course, but from movies/ biographies. The craze is certainly on w/ #BTS
On Air: @PatThornby is #NowPlaying Let It Be by @thebeatles on Molten Gold
@dieguisxldu , your song, COME TOGETHER by @THEBEATLES , is playing in a few mins on 98.9 WMMO Sponsored by Stages of Life Medical Institute! Listen @http:// ftur.io/4sfwTc
If you read biographies of @thebeatles you know that they faced the same problems like @BTS_twt . That's one of the reasons the comparison isn't too farfetched. For their time they where too wild and like BTS where not afraid to speak up against things others were afraid to do.
