I bet @GeorgeHarrison wasn't even shaving when this photo was taken. But he was pure #Rockabilly #fire on the guitar. Listen to Cry for a Shadow if you think I'm wrong. @TheBeatles

I gather "Penny Lane" was one of many @thebeatles songs named after locations in #Liverpool . They will always be the greatest musical act of all time. I always loved their early #music best. "Help", "Hard Days Night"... you know them all. Amazing musicians.
