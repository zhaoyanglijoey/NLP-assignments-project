great Fab Four song selections just on @thebeatles channel on @SIRIUSXM just finishing, by Cherisse (sp?) of Texas .... I not only love the selections but agree (a rarity) with everything she says about them (I Saw Her Standing There, Girl, Rain, As My Guitar Gently Weeps)

The official @thebeatles account has 3.6 million followers. 3.6 million. For a band that broke up almost 50 years ago, and has only two living members already in their 70s. Will there ever be a phenomenon like that again?

@PeerIGN probably been said a million times already but doesn't #Pepperland by @thebeatles sound just like recent #Mario game soundtracks? In fact all the symphonic stuff from the #YellowSubmarine is very similar.

Imagine being inside the Gaumont Theatre in England 54 years ago tonight. @TheKinks were the opening act for @thebeatles .
@MzLycan had #CabbagePatchDolls . I loved they wore 3 month-old clothes. Lost in horrific fire with all things @thebeatles which would be worth a fortune, too! #PMHT

When @thebeatles wrote A Day In The Life in 1967, the Royal Albert Hall objected to being mentioned in the song and asked them to change the lyric. Here is the letter from the @RoyalAlbertHall and the cheeky reply from @johnlennon pic.twitter.com/rut9zIcDCP
