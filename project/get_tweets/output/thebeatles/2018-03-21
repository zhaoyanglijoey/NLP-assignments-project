I am not into grunge. I am not into bands that do a melancholy @thebeatles imitation and get the attention of critics who have kept so many great bands out of the hall of fame. I like what I like and have no desire to like what you like.
#OnThisDay in 1964, After #IWantToHoldYourHand had held the No.1 position on the US singles chart for 7 weeks, @TheBeatles started a 2 week run at No.1 with #SheLovesYou . https:// youtu.be/Te5KoX3hQz4
On this day in 1967, @pinkfloyd and @thebeatles met in the control room of Studio Two. At the time The Beatles were recording Sgt.

Thanks to @thebeatles for being a HUGE part of my life every day, ever since I can remember. I don't know what I'd do w/o #TheBeatles - I know I wouldn't be who I am & wouldn't have the wisdom and joy I have in this lifetime or any that follow. #WednesdayWisdom #EverydayThanks

What is it about this particular version that makes people love it so much? It can be difficult to explain the exact reasons, as famed groups like The @TheBeachBoys and @thebeatles covered the song but never achieved the same magic as The Kingsmen despite their stature.
You say goodbye, and I say HENLO... HENLO, HENLO... #HenloJeremy @VoiceTeensJer @JereMinionsAUS @JereMinionsOFC @thebeatles

Long after Elton John, Bono and even the Beatles' producer, George Martin, #RingoStarr has finally been knighted! Sir Ringo has a nice ring. Which classic song from @thebeatles should @SamandAmy end the show with?
You were ripping on @ringostarrmusic and @TheBeatles other day. Today, filled with praise?

Brilliant really liked it. Track four for me is a stand out !! The start reminds me of @thebeatles and @ledzeppelin but the feel of the track is like the latest @NoelGallagher album. Played it again a couple of times on the way back home. Will be good to see you at a gig soon !!
