Can we stop calling them @thebeatles please. They are murderous cowards who killed unarmed & tied up people they are so far removed from "All you need is love" as its possible to be.
To those who say the @thebeatles were overrated musicians & songwriters... you're idiots AND tone deaf! Just ask greats like @thedavidcrosby @misterryanadams etc... Just go back to listening to Kanye...
@thebeatles kind of night
Thank you @thebeatles @foofighters and @pinkfloyd for having such beatiful songs that moved me to tears as I played for my grandmother. I love her and K love you all.
Listening to @Spotify is a great pleasure. @AnnieLennox @thebeatles @EricBibb . Life is good!
