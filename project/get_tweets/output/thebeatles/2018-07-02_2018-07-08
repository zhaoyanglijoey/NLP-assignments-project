When I listened to the @thebeatles albums a few years ago, I chose to listen to them chronologically, one album per month, to get a better idea of their artistic growth. Let's just say it was a good year. So, I appreciate that idea.

@thebeatles ' #YellowSubmarine sounded & looked fabulous on it's 50th anniversary @CurzonBbury . That music! The groundbreaking, iconic animation & mesmerising art design! Who needs a narrative? I've a feeling there may have been some dropped acid in its production... Great stuff! pic.twitter.com/RNuieUE4gD
So wonderful to see #YellowSubmarine today on big screen. I saw it in grade school and I was instantly besotted with @thebeatles . My parents had to explain how they'd broken up so I couldn't see them live. Happy 50th birthday #YellowSubmarine
@jswartzy1 Dining in Johnny Rockets prior to the Ant Man movie, and they were playing non-stop @thebeatles songs. So of COURSE you came to mind.
Dream scenario: I'd fly to Liverpool & see @cheaptrick play a club @thebeatles did as a local group. Meanwhile there'd be a John & @yokoono exhibit open and 4 days earlier @PaulMcCartney would play the @EchoArena and I'd get to see a Beatle IN Liverpool. Oh wait! That's reality.
