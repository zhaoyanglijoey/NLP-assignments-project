So I just realized that @thebeatles follows me!
Reading @thebeatles beatles_life_ beatlesabbeyroad https://www. instagram.com/p/BeT2WUElw7S/
I was just reminded of a story I should share. I once was singing loudly at a stop light to @thebeatles 8 days a week when two guys pull up at this long light, hear me and pull out bongos and a fiddle and play along. #onlyinColorado #Colorado pic.twitter.com/j9HDf5ZmHM
I once jammed out to @thebeatles 8 days a week at a stoplight with the windows down two guys pull up, it's a long light, pull out bongos and a fiddle and play along with me! Most awesome trip to the store ever! pic.twitter.com/DBsNC2pkfx
You guys ever notice how some of the world's most sick and twisted minds of recent history are walking the streets like normal? Instead of acting on thier horrible thoughts, they make movies with them Turning that negative into a positive like @thebeatles recommended. #HeyJude

An encouraging sign: Sitting in the parking lot at this elementary #school in Liberty, Missouri and a teenager pulled into the lot with @thebeatles blaring on the #radio . There is hope for the future. :)
I like @thebeatles
Wow, @thebeatles made some beautiful tunes in their day. Long live @PaulMcCartney and @ringostarrmusic
@thebeatles Follow me, please.
#reco @StephenBrodsky 's #OctaveMuseum // This whole album sounds like it's from an alternate universe in which @thebeatles are still recording.

Ah yes, that is a classic song by @TheBeatles , sung by John Lemon. ;D
Here's a little trivia for you: @thebeatles song, "Martha My Dear" was written about Paul McCartney's Old English Sheep Dog. This leads us to believe that when you adopt Martha the rat from Jenns Exotic Pets in the Eastern Hills Mall, she comes with a theme song! PERFECT! pic.twitter.com/3i4nvC9m0T
