I have 400+ @thebeatles songs on Spotify, the vinyl stays away for special occasions so these remasters are doing the job. It's currently the only playlist I have or use. For me its not about what I listen to when I am happy, it's what I listen to that makes me happy.

JAN 1963 - Happiness is having an older brother who loves music & shares that with you. In early 1963, my brother Randall (pictured here) told me about a NEW group called @thebeatles who had a No. 1 disc titled PLEASE PLEASE ME. Thanks Randall for getting things rolling. pic.twitter.com/qPnhdGtC3v
Kenapa @ManCity selalu nyanyiin lagu "Hey Jude"? Lagu hey jude dirilis @thebeatles pada tahun 1968, di tahun yang sama city menjadi juara inggris untuk pertama kalinya. Hey jude menjadi sebuah pengingat.

Look at @thebeatles , they broke up a long time ago, but the legacy they have left has not made us feel like they're gone. They're always there. Disbanded but never dissolved.
Today in 2002, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen was voted the UK's favorite single of all time in a poll by the @GWR Hit Singles book. 'Imagine' by @johnlennon was voted No. 2 and 'Hey Jude' by @thebeatles was No. 3, 'Dancing Queen' by ABBA was 4th, @Madonna 'Like A Prayer' was 5th. pic.twitter.com/7jg28NyFdd
Kult und kauzig zugleich: das Mellotron, die analoge Urform des Samplers. @TheBeatles haben es verwendet, aber es tritt auch in zahllosen TV-Serien der 1960er auf. Neue Folge von "Musikers Handwerkzeug" @dlf http:// dlf.de/417079

@AppleSupport completely disappointed me when they got rid of the 40 gig Classic iPod. Maybe some of us need every @thebeatles song, in mono & stereo, & every @nineinchnails halo with us at all times. Maybe we will get into a @Portisheadinfo mood, or feel @LennyKravitz . #CAPACITY

At the bar. The band has played Van Morrison and Johnny Cash, but gave me a quiziacal look when I asked for @thebeatles . This moment in history is sorely lacking, when it comes to music.
