I've been listening to @thebeatles throughout the day today (I'm a casual fan of theirs) and I just heard the song "Run For Your Life" for the first time. Yeesh. Very disturbing song about domestic violence. Didn't expect a song like that from them.

@thebeatles Booked my Tickets to see Yellow submarine in Liverpool on the the 8th cant wait.
I must say @johnlennon was right when he said " @iamfonda was uncool" after annoying him by saying "I know what it's like to be dead" which inspired @johnlennon to write @thebeatles ' song "She Said She Said". @iamfonda is a walking problem with no solution.
. @thebeatles uploaded 6 new videos on youtube today but all we want is the HD rooftop concert pls bro
@thebeatles are timeless. #CarpoolKaraoke #YellowSubmarine @JKCorden @PaulMcCartney @ringostarrmusic @latelateshow @johnlennon @GeorgeHarrison pic.twitter.com/fgcKan3450
Hey hey Everything sounds better in the bog Hey hey Uh Huh cc: @thebeatles @PaulMcCartney
I agree with that - as a massive @thebeatles fan I may have shed a silent tear as @PaulMcCartney started to sing that. That man is to be treasured for the sheer volume of hours that I've listened to his music #InMyLife #CarpoolKaraoke
Carpool Karaoke with @PaulMcCartney was pure TV Gold. Been a huge @thebeatles fan all my life and found it quite emotional to see him performing Hey Jude at the pub in Liverpool seeing as The Beatles never got to. What I'd have given to be at that venue.
What a song amazing loving @thebeatles in Portugal tonight!! pic.twitter.com/rQPP6wTHKy
@thebeatles Paul great YouTube The Journey will never end. Peace and Love forever.

@TxNitA627 sometimes I wish that our #airband covered songs from outside @thebeatles catalog. Because when @rickspringfield 's #JessiesGirl starts playing I can't help but rock out and kill that solo. I guess we can always use it during sound check.
@AlamoNYC Any chance of an all ages @thebeatles Yellow Submarine screening?
I'm venturing into unfamiliar territory this morning by listening to @TheBeatles ' "White Album," released in 1968 - the first year of my late parents' doomed marriage. In honour of Caroleen and John; and the Maharishi. Om, shanti, shanti, shanti. @TMMeditation

I wish I was alive to see @thebeatles in their prime
I work in a Hospice/Residential Care Facility for the Elderly. 2 weeks ago a resident named Sally noticed my tats. I showed her my first one; A reference to @thebeatles (post Dylan). Today she pulled my wife aside and told her that her favorite Beatle was Paul.
When I was much younger, I lived in a studio apt, and when my mom and dad were gone at work, I'd spend 6hrs a day over two summers singing EVERY SONG on the @thebeatles Blue Album, especially "Hey, Jude". You are still one of my life's heroes @PaulMcCartney <3 #fellowBassist
