Simple disclaimer: I am a huge @thebeatles fan too, so no offense meant.
To continue this train of thought. @aha_com 's Take On Me on @Spotify has nearly as many plays as @billboard 's Top 5, Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs Combined... And, more plays than any @thebeatles song #Impressed

The big screen rerelease of @thebeatles #YellowSubmarine is incredible + shows the music, animation, writing and voice acting are all equally as good. Rarely get the sense of rediscovering a film I've seen so much but the 50th anniversary screening did the trick... #TheBeatles pic.twitter.com/cPeQa9iBWA
