Just watched @thebeatles #eightdaysaweek film. Just such a great story. Never gets old. Just getting a sneak peak into the lives of those four is always a joy.
@thebeatles on vinyl all the way!
Tonight's #LinkVoices film is The U.S. vs. John Lennon, an examination of @johnlennon 's transformation from a member of @thebeatles to a rallying anti-war activist striving for world peace during the Nixon administration. Join us at 11 p.m. http:// bit.ly/2m4UxK6 pic.twitter.com/ygXGZW0n0E

NOV 25 1963 - "Beatlemania! With The Beatles" Lp is issued. The final song on Side 2 is MONEY ... & MONEY is what young Beatles fans needed in the 1960s to BUY new vinyl records by @thebeatles . There was no other form of payment for a Beatles disc. "Money, give me money" pic.twitter.com/Ht6WOkRYic

@HamiltonMusical lasted me the first flight. @thebeatles pushed me through the second flight. God Bless

Let It Be is the @thebeatles at their best. The kind of jam session we all wish we could be a part of.
Watched @thebeatles #eightdaysaweek film. The first half is so joyful, they're having so much fun & the second half is breaking my heart Amazing film, loved it
My first favourite band. Feel so lucky and privileged to have lived through @theBeatles in the *1960s* . #8daysaweek . Great watch
Last nights documentary is a must for any @thebeatles fans some brilliant footage of the band #eightdaysaweek
And went - VERY DRUNK - to see @thebeatles ' @Cirque show. Which was AMAZING. So much so that one of the acrobatic stunts made me gasp SO hard I started to choke. ... And out flew that piece of undigested ginger, right into the hair of the lady in front.
Watching #aharddaysnight wow! My fave band @thebeatles (before my time too) @PaulMcCartney what a film! @RealRonHoward #happydays enjoying with @GordonsGin10 @SchweppesUK and @popchipsUK

For years, I always thought Revolver was my favorite Beatles album. However, after looking at some of my listening stats on Last.fm, it seems like I listen to Rubber Soul tracks more than anything else. @TheBeatles #TheBeatles pic.twitter.com/I4eN3AMcXo

@Paul_Crowder enjoyed your Eight Days a Week @thebeatles documentary last night. Never really liked them, I blame our old music teacher, then again I wasn't teacher's pet...
Loved being on @NewstalkFM this morning, "In The Executive Chair" with the great @bobbykerr , talking @bbdodublin , @thebeatles , @Boro and everything in between.

At moments like this I wish I were born during that era. To be able to experience @thebeatles live :even during their peak of popularity or even to just have been able to witness them as a group in general would've been amazing.

Aaahh, entonces en este caso son importantes los 4, yo no me imagino a @thebeatles sin alguno de los 4!
For the record, I have never taken LSD or acid. I'm only guessing that the @thebeatles song #ADayInTheLife is what I think it would be like. I don't want to find out.
George Harrison compuso las 2 mejores rolas de @thebeatles , incluso John y Paul alguna vez declararon que les hubiera gustado componerlas a ellos; "Something" y "Here Comes The Sun"!
I totally get @thebeatles song #ADayInTheLife now (continued)
And there I was... Listening to @thebeatles
Those two missed a one in a lifetime opportunity! I guess, considering Lennon's future wife, these girls could got married at least one @thebeatles ! @SonnicSue ...

Still today the words, music and magic created by @thebeatles is just pure gold. I could listen to them forever... I do believe our city @CultureLPool should have the strap line #8daysaweek - both a tribute to the boys and the fact so much to do in our city!
