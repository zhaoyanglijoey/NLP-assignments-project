There's real magic in groups of 4 and @sanderssays explains how it works in this week's Beyond Speaking #podcast , along with why @ringostarrmusic was a huge key to @thebeatles success & how to create true innovation from disruptive collaboration.

At the end of the @thebeatles Two Of Us, Paul whistles the same tune as the end of Lady Madonna. And there's also the She Loves You call back at the end of All You Need Is Love.

With talk of a dining crunch abounding, @leonrestaurants is showing the casual eating scene the way by looking to expand in the US. Can they follow @TheBeatles and break America? c/o @EveningStandard : https:// bit.ly/2yLch60 pic.twitter.com/xtvTghRIRV

I know @thebeatles "Yesterday" is an iconic song, but for @JTeespeak to play it TWICE IN A ROW on @JackFMDFW 's #720Game yet "run out of time" for @TheRealGerardo 's #RicoSuave ? I feel like I'm in a glass case of emotion! pic.twitter.com/aV8nKQAvW0

I have to admit, I never heard of the #NewJersey band the @GripWeeds before (other than their namesake character's potrayal by @JohnLennon in How I Won the War), but their cover of @TheBeatles @GeorgeHarrison song #TheInnerLight was a lot of fun and a pleasant surprise. pic.twitter.com/bOcYXqvMF7

Of late, some folks have slagged @thebeatles like Keith Jones and Quincy Richards (sarcasm intended)...I understand that you suffer from #BeatleEnvy ...nice try Keith Quincy, but theirs will always be bigger than yours, just face it and weep...
I wish I was alive to see @thebeatles in their prime
I work in a Hospice/Residential Care Facility for the Elderly. 2 weeks ago a resident named Sally noticed my tats. I showed her my first one; A reference to @thebeatles (post Dylan). Today she pulled my wife aside and told her that her favorite Beatle was Paul.
When I was much younger, I lived in a studio apt, and when my mom and dad were gone at work, I'd spend 6hrs a day over two summers singing EVERY SONG on the @thebeatles Blue Album, especially "Hey, Jude". You are still one of my life's heroes @PaulMcCartney <3 #fellowBassist
Just like the guy who.owned Vee Jay Records, who.let go a group called @thebeatles ...

@jamescordenbae thank you for reminding us all why we love @thebeatles and for bringing love back in our hearts.
Inspired by @neiltyson to change the title of #SpaceCitySpeedGospel into "Astro-Gospel For People In A Rush", but @thebeatles beat me to it: Joan was quizzical studied meta-physical science in the fall...
