Listening to @thebeatles over breakfast and had a #random memory of the first time I heard #LetItBe . It was #PaulMcCartney singing it at #LiveAid with stage microphone interference and some guy talking over the song. #childhood

Informative and enjoyable post, but I wouldn't call them a modern-day @thebeatles . That's too much pressure, and @ArcticMonkeys have charted their own path that always seems ready for mainstream success, but retains their indie honed styles and sound. https:// westerncourier.com/?p=40977
