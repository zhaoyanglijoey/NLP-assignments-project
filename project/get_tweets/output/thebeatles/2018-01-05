@thebeatles Documentary on @Channel4 is great. But the ad breaks every 10mins is a fucking joke.

@RealRonHoward Just saw 'Eight Days a Week' on Channel 4 (UK), and really enjoyed it. Just wondered why the pitch on the music was slightly higher than the album versions I have? Issue with my tele, or something to do with speed/pitch on original tape masters? @thebeatles
Always been my fav @thebeatles chooon https:// youtu.be/jZzEvqDQfIA
@thebeatles Eight Days a week The touring years, great memories and great footage. The greatest band of all time ever.

Absolutely loving #eightdaysaweek ! When you put a @thebeatles album on it is always awesome, but sometimes you just need to watch them on stage or in interview to remember why they were such a phenomenon. #FabFour thank you. x

Together for a mere ten years, @thebeatles led a musical revolution that radically transformed the sound and significance of rock & roll.
