Last night I was playing something random in the piano. I just found out I was playing the intro to Hey Bulldog by @thebeatles . Talk about being psychic.

I'm sure there are hundreds of thousands of reasons people are marching today for gun control in America which are every bit as touching if not more so, but to see @PaulMcCartney marching for @johnlennon is magnificent. @thebeatles
@PaulMcCartney , marching in New York City, notes poignantly that he lost "a good friend" to gun violence just a few blocks away. #JohnLennon #MarchForOurLives @JohnLennon #Imagine @thebeatles
So cool! #imagine if @johnlennon was here to see this. @PaulMcCartney @thebeatles #EndGunViolence #MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/isTVvC1EOA

Just back from a short visit to #Liverpool - a really friendly city with lots to see and do. Loved the #MagicalMysteryTour especially seeing the house where @GeorgeHarrison was born. The @cavernliverpool is very much at the heart of the celebration of @thebeatles and rightly so. pic.twitter.com/0DVklDEfex

I have ALWAYS loved @thebeatles ..... this makes me realize i made the correct choice
We are the stereotypical British family playing @thebeatles and drinking tea, watching @HarryPotterFilm and doing British things like complaining about how blooming cold it is outside Gordon Bennett
