ICYMI: Truly nothing like seeing @RobZombie & @marilynmanson covering @thebeatles ' "Helter Skelter" while the screens behind them are filled with images of Charles Manson and his family. Here's my @azcentral review with awesome photographs by Jim Louvau. https:// bit.ly/2MxwkLQ

Loved your interview with @HowardStern ! You are such a great caretaker of the @thebeatles history and story. How do you stay patient with years of endless questions about, "who wrote this one?" or "What was this song about?" questions. PS please come to SF again, we love you!
@PaulMcCartney Was Alan Partridge right when he said the best album by @thebeatles is 'The Best of The Beatles'? Is #EgyptStation your greatest solo album? pic.twitter.com/IjHDky34bi

#EgyptStation @PaulMcCartney . Did you ever think that @thebeatles and even all your solo material would still be popular today? Even with the younger generations?
