@thebeatles beating out @bobdylan on the #70sat7 tonight. Thanks for your votes. @jeffspindelboom
"The Two Of Us" @thebeatles : "You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead"
Which song will be our winner on the #70sat7 - @bobdylan - Knockin' On Heaven's Door or @thebeatles - Let It Be ? @jeffspindelboom
Scrolling Twitter and noticed that @PaulMcCartney and @thebeatles released first album on this day in history. @24Griffey made his debut. But nobody gave mention to @AmericaFirst69 and his speech. #history
@thebeatles
You know I may respect @thebeatles but I think there very overrated and has a guitar player tired of playing there music
