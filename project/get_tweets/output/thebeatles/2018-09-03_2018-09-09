S/o to the dream I had the other night where I was one of @thebeatles (unsure which one). We were walking through East Austin and I asked my fellow Beatles if they thought we could cut to the front of the line at @FranklinBbq . They all agreed we probably could. We kept walking.
1966 @thebeatles Revolver The Beatles recorded the #album following a three-month break from professional commitments at the start of 1966, and during a period when #London was feted as the era's #cultural capital. #RocknRoll #RockAlbumsPlus @PaulMcCartney pic.twitter.com/YUEqqwel3f
Burning things is not the answer. ideologues and extremists once burned @TheBeatles records. The band got through it ok, I hear. Courage, Nike.
