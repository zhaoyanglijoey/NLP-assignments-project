Ready to rock, Virginia?!? It's gonna be another wild night at @RhodesideGrill tonight!! I'll be playing songs from #campfireparty and all your favorite covers from @thebeatles to @LilJon 10pm-1:30, no cover! See ya there!
I've been listening to a lot of @thebeatles these days (their music helps to transport me to a different time and place, which is nice, since living in reality is so exhausting for me these days), and I've currently got the song "Chains" going through my head. Can't say I mind.
