Hearing Rubber Soul in full today in my life. What an amazing record from @thebeatles , continues the streak from Beatles for Sale with thoughtful, mature songs.
@thebeatles Looking at a Beatles website it appears their first gig outside of Liverpool (apart from Hamburg) was Alloa Town Hall in 1960?
My dream is to be a singer like @billyjoel first. love David Cassidy, Michel Berger, the @thebeatles .My first goal is to be a singer even if I still have to work my voice is far from perfect yet but I cling. it's my only goal in the life. I must not give up. I have to get there! pic.twitter.com/1zaDypSjiC

Was just telling my daughter about how many albums @thebeatles had done in their 10yrs. I said it was because they are the best. She said "and @Shinedown and @LittleMix are the best". I love that I've taught her all sorts of music! @TheBrentSmith @ZMyersOfficial @BKerchofficial
