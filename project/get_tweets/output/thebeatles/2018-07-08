Cool @thebeatles find at the @OmniHotels Shoreham DC - a great story about their first paying #concert two days after their live 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. Plus, their original handwritten set list. #TheBeatles pic.twitter.com/llCJ0bssb6
@thebeatles ' #YellowSubmarine sounded & looked fabulous on it's 50th anniversary @CurzonBbury . That music! The groundbreaking, iconic animation & mesmerising art design! Who needs a narrative? I've a feeling there may have been some dropped acid in its production... Great stuff! pic.twitter.com/RNuieUE4gD
So wonderful to see #YellowSubmarine today on big screen. I saw it in grade school and I was instantly besotted with @thebeatles . My parents had to explain how they'd broken up so I couldn't see them live. Happy 50th birthday #YellowSubmarine
@jswartzy1 Dining in Johnny Rockets prior to the Ant Man movie, and they were playing non-stop @thebeatles songs. So of COURSE you came to mind.
Dream scenario: I'd fly to Liverpool & see @cheaptrick play a club @thebeatles did as a local group. Meanwhile there'd be a John & @yokoono exhibit open and 4 days earlier @PaulMcCartney would play the @EchoArena and I'd get to see a Beatle IN Liverpool. Oh wait! That's reality.

Went to see @thebeatles 50th anniversary screening of Yellow Submarine tonight - what a wonderfully mad film pic.twitter.com/ri8mStDq8N
On the way to see animated @thebeatles on the big screen in KC!! It was released in 1968, the year my parents got married, and they played it for their children, hence, a family favorite. #YellowSubmarine
