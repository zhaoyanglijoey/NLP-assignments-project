@jswartzy1 Dining in Johnny Rockets prior to the Ant Man movie, and they were playing non-stop @thebeatles songs. So of COURSE you came to mind.
Dream scenario: I'd fly to Liverpool & see @cheaptrick play a club @thebeatles did as a local group. Meanwhile there'd be a John & @yokoono exhibit open and 4 days earlier @PaulMcCartney would play the @EchoArena and I'd get to see a Beatle IN Liverpool. Oh wait! That's reality.

@malcotheatres @thebeatles I understand that F'ville probably gets more business than Ft Smith, but why did I have to pay $2 more a ticket to see Yellow Submarine in Ft Smith than my friends had to pay in F'ville? $14 vs. $12 a ticket. Seems wrong and bad form Malco.

I'm just here for @thebeatles being in top 10 even years after most of their members died. Legends will never go down. Hope to see @BTS_twt hold up like this in the future as well. I have a feeling they won't be just a sensation.
