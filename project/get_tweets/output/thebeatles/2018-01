Listening to the @SIRIUSXM @thebeatles countdown. @PaulMcCartney wrote Blackbird in 1968 during the height of the Civil Rights movement. May you be our Blackbird in 2018 @staceyabrams . https:// youtu.be/9l5L34VqzlU
Started 2018 in the past. #BeatlesforSale and #RubberSoul . Surely pop music at its very best? @thebeatles played through @AppleMusic on my new @beoplay A1. Can the year get any better?
I'm glad to see Daft Punk up there but what about #Rain by @thebeatles ?
I am over the moon that @GibbBarry & @ringostarrmusic have been knighted. #NewYearsHonoursList It is hard to imagine a world without @BeeGees or @thebeatles Their music has been the soundtrack to so many of our lives.
Watching 8 Days A Week, the Beatles documentary directed by Ron Howard. @thebeatles
@RealRonHoward Just saw #Eightdaysaweek shows how good @GeorgeHarrison and @ringostarrmusic were live. Sometimes we forget that. @thebeatles

So @Spotify served up Hello, Goodbye by @thebeatles as the first song played in our house in 2018 and it was pretty much perfection
@BeatlesOfCourse @thebeatles sad to hear of the passing of R Gary Patterson(2017). I've read countless Beatles books, but my favorite is his "The Walrus Was Paul". EVERY line has a 'clue' and I still enjoy it to this day. Suggested read for any #beatlemaniac . You will enjoy it!

It's hard to appreciate what exactly they accomplished without learning about where the pop culture was in 1963. Buddy Holly was dead. America was hungry for excitement. Along came the British Invasion helmed by no less than the @thebeatles . The world was a different place in
I would agree that as far as music goes, many instances are purely subjective. In the case of the @thebeatles this is simply not true. It's ok if you don't relate to the music. They flourished in a time you never lived (an I wrong? Did you grow up in post ww2 Europe or America?)

@BrianWilsonLive Brian, I liked your tribute to @thebeatles producer George Martin that appeared in Time magazine.
@JonesysJukebox Kajagoo-goo [phonetic] of 1983 #USArmedForcesRadio #hitparade , #BerlinGermany , is to #BoyGeorge what the #DaveClarkFive was to @thebeatles in 1964. #contemporaneousbesties this SF Bay Area resident growing up.
#DaveClark5 were contemporaries and they were both my favorites. Maybe at one point I liked the DC5 single more than @thebeatles , but like @RollingStones , had a bigger arsenal touring. Then when DC5 faded, the beatles didn't have to tour. "There can only be one." @JonesysJukebox
