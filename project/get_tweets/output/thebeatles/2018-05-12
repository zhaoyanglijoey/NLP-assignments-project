#surie #eurovision did a good job...but it predictably turned into a post #Brexit snub to the #UK the nation that gave the world @thebeatles @TheKinks @pinkfloyd & much more. As for Australia.. pic.twitter.com/tP18JG2C9w
There was a period there where McCartney only wore this black suit and Lennon only wore his white suit. #YinYang the two of them were. @thebeatles
Here There and Everywhere @thebeatles
I agree! Even though @thebeatles are pretty amazing
#DosAndDontsOfBabysitting Do get Amy Pond to let you borrow the tardis to go back and thank your babysitter for giving you original 45 of @thebeatles 'We Can Work It Out' / 'Day Tripper.' Don't go back in time to when you were 16 and hit on her. Yeah right. I did that, too ;)

My wish is going in Tokyo, and also i wanna be a singer like @billyjoel , @thebeatles , @johnlennon They are my model. but be myself. But I'm still looking for myself I still do not trust myself. I have to work 2 times more with my psychic handicap. I hope to get there. pic.twitter.com/IqtxzSWGo7
