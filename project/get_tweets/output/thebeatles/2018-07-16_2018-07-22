It was #OTD in 1968 that @thebeatles film "Yellow Submarine" made its world premiere in London. The animated classic is of course on our list of essential Beatles films! http:// bit.ly/2ff8Gl0 pic.twitter.com/KSkmUDW4hs
Today marks the 50th anniversary for the UK release of @TheBeatles animated classic #YellowSubmarine The landmark film premiered at The London Pavilion on 17 July 1968 with the Fab Four making a cameo appearance but not supplying their own voices for the characters. rt @AbbeyRoad pic.twitter.com/lp6j5hGijl
Now playing: Hey Jude @thebeatles
Imagine writing, recording and releasing Help!, Rubber Soul and Revolver in 415 days. Fragments of my tiny blown mind will never comprehend that. @thebeatles

I NEED ANOTHER BEATLES BIOPIC THAT HAS ACCURATE ACTORS LIKE BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY RIGHT NOW @THEBEATLES
Listening to @realDonaldTrump throw US Intelligence agencies under the bus while cozying up to Putin reminds me of @thebeatles lyric..."Back in the USS, Back in the USS, Back in the USS...R!"
@thebeatles I feel fine is no.267 in the world all-time-charts #Ifeelfine #Beatles

@thebeatles I just watched Paul McCartney Freedom video with the recent events it rings so true
What an absolute treat - OaNS is one of the most gigantically-underrated @thebeatles tunes, and certainly equally deserves to be on Pepper along with SFF & Penny Lane. In fact, I think it sounds best right in between them!
I STAN PURE TALENT!!!! @PaulMcCartney @thebeatles please see this, he is such a huge fan and so talented.
Kid Leo's Daily Double Take today is Hey Jude by @thebeatles . Tune in to hear the other artist playing this song. Any guesses? #LSUG
