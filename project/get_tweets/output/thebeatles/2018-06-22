Hey hey Everything sounds better in the bog Hey hey Uh Huh cc: @thebeatles @PaulMcCartney
I agree with that - as a massive @thebeatles fan I may have shed a silent tear as @PaulMcCartney started to sing that. That man is to be treasured for the sheer volume of hours that I've listened to his music #InMyLife #CarpoolKaraoke
Carpool Karaoke with @PaulMcCartney was pure TV Gold. Been a huge @thebeatles fan all my life and found it quite emotional to see him performing Hey Jude at the pub in Liverpool seeing as The Beatles never got to. What I'd have given to be at that venue.
What a song amazing loving @thebeatles in Portugal tonight!! pic.twitter.com/rQPP6wTHKy
