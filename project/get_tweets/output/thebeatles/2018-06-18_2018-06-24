In '68, @thebeatles released #YellowSubmarine . Depending who you ask, it's pop art, surreal allegory or a trip. Whatever it is, it's FAB.

@thebeatles Booked my Tickets to see Yellow submarine in Liverpool on the the 8th cant wait.
I must say @johnlennon was right when he said " @iamfonda was uncool" after annoying him by saying "I know what it's like to be dead" which inspired @johnlennon to write @thebeatles ' song "She Said She Said". @iamfonda is a walking problem with no solution.
. @thebeatles uploaded 6 new videos on youtube today but all we want is the HD rooftop concert pls bro
@thebeatles are timeless. #CarpoolKaraoke #YellowSubmarine @JKCorden @PaulMcCartney @ringostarrmusic @latelateshow @johnlennon @GeorgeHarrison pic.twitter.com/fgcKan3450
Hey hey Everything sounds better in the bog Hey hey Uh Huh cc: @thebeatles @PaulMcCartney
I agree with that - as a massive @thebeatles fan I may have shed a silent tear as @PaulMcCartney started to sing that. That man is to be treasured for the sheer volume of hours that I've listened to his music #InMyLife #CarpoolKaraoke
Carpool Karaoke with @PaulMcCartney was pure TV Gold. Been a huge @thebeatles fan all my life and found it quite emotional to see him performing Hey Jude at the pub in Liverpool seeing as The Beatles never got to. What I'd have given to be at that venue.
What a song amazing loving @thebeatles in Portugal tonight!! pic.twitter.com/rQPP6wTHKy
@thebeatles Paul great YouTube The Journey will never end. Peace and Love forever.
Yes, Tis the season, We need our country back now. @carlreiner @garbage @ddlovato @thebeatles @ladygaga @DrBrianMay

Wonderful video! Doubtful I'll see you to ask about the story of your Dad anytime soon, but good for him! Best I can do is that a friend of mine was in the audience when @thebeatles played The Ed Sullivan Show in Miami! (nobody was rescued...)
