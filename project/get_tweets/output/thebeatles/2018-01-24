@BrianWilsonLive Brian, I liked your tribute to @thebeatles producer George Martin that appeared in Time magazine.
@JonesysJukebox Kajagoo-goo [phonetic] of 1983 #USArmedForcesRadio #hitparade , #BerlinGermany , is to #BoyGeorge what the #DaveClarkFive was to @thebeatles in 1964. #contemporaneousbesties this SF Bay Area resident growing up.
#DaveClark5 were contemporaries and they were both my favorites. Maybe at one point I liked the DC5 single more than @thebeatles , but like @RollingStones , had a bigger arsenal touring. Then when DC5 faded, the beatles didn't have to tour. "There can only be one." @JonesysJukebox

After two days of quoting lines from @TheBeatles 1965 film #HELP with @SherlockPHD and @ElliottMilstein , I can say that while I love and admire #AHardDaysNight and concede it may be the superior film, my heart will always belong to Help!
