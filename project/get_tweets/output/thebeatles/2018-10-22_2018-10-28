. @thebeatles - Rubber Soul. They were sheer fucking class from day one, but this was when it moved up a gear for me. Zimmerman and Marijuana did them the world of good. Folky at times, introspective, mature, experienced, experimental. Had my first proper drink to this. pic.twitter.com/wBboBFIdum

"May I bug you for a Moment? As Halloween approaches it is more than a costume you see. While some of the greats are lost. We carry on, bringing a legacy back to life with a renewed idea or concept. Just imagine all the People."- @FrancescaHowley , @thebeatles pic.twitter.com/se8qlYHqIj
Turns out that if you play @thebeatles ' "Honey Pie" over "Good Night" you end up with a weirdly satisfactory overlay of music hall and orchestral, with lashings of McCartney two tempo call and response.

If you don't think @thebeatles lyrics having meaning today. You are seriously need to reevaluate.
Yeah, BS called on blaming @thebeatles for Charles Manson. Is the part of the criterion for getting verified include saying really stupid things? @realDonaldTrump literally declared himself a (White) Nationalist. Trump was radicalized by his racist Nazi dad. #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/5vccu2SnoH
