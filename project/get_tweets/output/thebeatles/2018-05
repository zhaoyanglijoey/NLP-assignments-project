Would love if you take a look into @BTS_twt , their music, their lyrics and their fandom. The similarities to @thebeatles ; the differences. I love both groups. Couldn't experience the BEATLEMANIA myself of course, but from movies/ biographies. The craze is certainly on w/ #BTS
On Air: @PatThornby is #NowPlaying Let It Be by @thebeatles on Molten Gold
@dieguisxldu , your song, COME TOGETHER by @THEBEATLES , is playing in a few mins on 98.9 WMMO Sponsored by Stages of Life Medical Institute! Listen @http:// ftur.io/4sfwTc
If you read biographies of @thebeatles you know that they faced the same problems like @BTS_twt . That's one of the reasons the comparison isn't too farfetched. For their time they where too wild and like BTS where not afraid to speak up against things others were afraid to do.

How about "Old Brown Shoe" by @thebeatles then?
Being that #1968 is trending, may I add being completely blown away by @TheBeatles and Hey Jude and wishing very much I was a part of the audience who sang with them at the Frost taping. The coda? Still the greatest thing ever. Well, that and Pepper.
