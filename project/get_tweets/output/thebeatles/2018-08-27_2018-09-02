So enjoying the top 100 @thebeatles songs on @SIRIUSXM . Granddaughter-the-younger says Ob-la Di Ob-la Da is the best ever! But the constant tease between every song is bothering me...
I've got Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End in the #1 position on my Top 200 @thebeatles Song List http:// supergroup.netfirms.com/index6.htm
TFW you leave a small amount of ice double-bagged in your car, thinking it'll be all right, but which, after melting, somehow finds its way out and ruins the packaging of your favorite @thebeatles album. pic.twitter.com/NeaDmqT9bx
Oh yeah. Genesis Home by the Sea/Second Home by the Sea, the Abbey Road medley is many songs in 1. Plus the Golden Slumbers Medley is 3 in - by @thebeatles , sometimes Big Balls/Rocker AC/DC. Beatles Sgt Pepper/With a Little Help, Sgt Pepper reprise/A Day in the Life...

WHile no one has made greater strides for us towards understanding about #love than the @thebeatles and @jesus , your strides to illuminate the part of the human soul (for lack of a better word) that we actively marginalize is just as significant. It's the beauty and meaning
Hmm. I wonder what @Netflix would do with Let It Be? ( @thebeatles )

Great @thebeatles countdown on Sirius satellite radio - the host Peter Asher was fantastic adding lots of color and inside baseball to the tracks. It was Fab - I highly recommend it.
@RaeSremmurd are the modern day Beach Boys....or maybe @thebeatles

I once had a girl or should I say she once had me She showed me her room isn't it good Norwegian Wood..... @thebeatles .... and when I awoke I was alone so I lit a fire isn't it good Norwegian Wood....
Working on cutting up new show @mcgsbackroom on @thebeatles and am reminded that John Lennon was a victim of gun violence here in the U.S. It is painful that our country has not been able to come up with a solution to reduce gun violence.
