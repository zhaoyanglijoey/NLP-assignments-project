Amazing how in the history of human kind there was only 4 artists/bands to have 3 songs at the same time in the top 5. They are [my #1] @50cent , @thebeatles , @justinbieber and the newest one is of course the least talented man in music besides JB, @Drake .

@TMar15 are you aware that @thebeatles follows you??
Love almost all @thebeatles music, but their early stuff is my favorite. A Hard Day's Night is brilliant & joyful. Listen to it again or for 1st time all the way thru. It's their best & one of best in history IMO.
