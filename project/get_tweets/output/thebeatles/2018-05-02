My 4 yr old heard "Criminal" on the way home from soccer practice and has been singing it ever since. She now loves @taylorswift13 , @britneyspears , and @thebeatles . @CassandraYoung @KrisKling
Feel like a @thebeatles song this morn, "Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a cone across my head". Let me explain. There I was trying to start my day, doing what most humans do these days; email check. Unbeknownst to me, I was about to be hit with an email that made me angry. 1/3
