Greatest harmonizing bands of all time: Beach Boys @CSNOfficial & @NeilYoung @thebeatles @Eaglesband @FleetwoodMac @BeeGees Let the debate begin
@TxNitA627 sometimes I wish that our #airband covered songs from outside @thebeatles catalog. Because when @rickspringfield 's #JessiesGirl starts playing I can't help but rock out and kill that solo. I guess we can always use it during sound check.
@AlamoNYC Any chance of an all ages @thebeatles Yellow Submarine screening?
I'm venturing into unfamiliar territory this morning by listening to @TheBeatles ' "White Album," released in 1968 - the first year of my late parents' doomed marriage. In honour of Caroleen and John; and the Maharishi. Om, shanti, shanti, shanti. @TMMeditation

Of late, some folks have slagged @thebeatles like Keith Jones and Quincy Richards (sarcasm intended)...I understand that you suffer from #BeatleEnvy ...nice try Keith Quincy, but theirs will always be bigger than yours, just face it and weep...
I wish I was alive to see @thebeatles in their prime
I work in a Hospice/Residential Care Facility for the Elderly. 2 weeks ago a resident named Sally noticed my tats. I showed her my first one; A reference to @thebeatles (post Dylan). Today she pulled my wife aside and told her that her favorite Beatle was Paul.
When I was much younger, I lived in a studio apt, and when my mom and dad were gone at work, I'd spend 6hrs a day over two summers singing EVERY SONG on the @thebeatles Blue Album, especially "Hey, Jude". You are still one of my life's heroes @PaulMcCartney <3 #fellowBassist
