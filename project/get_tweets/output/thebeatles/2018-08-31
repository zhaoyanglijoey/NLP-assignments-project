So enjoying the top 100 @thebeatles songs on @SIRIUSXM . Granddaughter-the-younger says Ob-la Di Ob-la Da is the best ever! But the constant tease between every song is bothering me...
I've got Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End in the #1 position on my Top 200 @thebeatles Song List http:// supergroup.netfirms.com/index6.htm
TFW you leave a small amount of ice double-bagged in your car, thinking it'll be all right, but which, after melting, somehow finds its way out and ruins the packaging of your favorite @thebeatles album. pic.twitter.com/NeaDmqT9bx
Oh yeah. Genesis Home by the Sea/Second Home by the Sea, the Abbey Road medley is many songs in 1. Plus the Golden Slumbers Medley is 3 in - by @thebeatles , sometimes Big Balls/Rocker AC/DC. Beatles Sgt Pepper/With a Little Help, Sgt Pepper reprise/A Day in the Life...
