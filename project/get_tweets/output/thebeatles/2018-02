My parents met in the @thebeatles section of the record store Their sublime tunes were both remedial enough to teach me piano & complex enough to draw me in as a violinist I met my husband whilst playing Norwegian Wood at a party W/O @thebeatles my world would be very different.
#OTD 06FEB1968 @thebeatles worked on two songs @AbbeyRoad , Lady Madonna and The Inner Light, which were to be the two sides of their next single. George added his vocal to The Inner Light, the music had been recorded in India the month before. Stream: http:// spoti.fi/2nEEZh5 pic.twitter.com/3SFT76JS4t
I learned to read, sing, speak, hear and understand the english language and to hear songs with stereo effects. And listen to this music could often heal my soul and make me a much better day. Imagine by @johnlennon is my religion. Thank you very much "The Beatles" @thebeatles
