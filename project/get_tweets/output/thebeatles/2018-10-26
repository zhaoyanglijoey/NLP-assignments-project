. @thebeatles - Rubber Soul. They were sheer fucking class from day one, but this was when it moved up a gear for me. Zimmerman and Marijuana did them the world of good. Folky at times, introspective, mature, experienced, experimental. Had my first proper drink to this. pic.twitter.com/wBboBFIdum
@thebeatles thank you
Kid Leo just ended his week with I Wanna Be Your Man by @thebeatles . #DidYouKnow Bob Dylan recorded a song called I Wanna Be Your Lover as an homage to this song? #LSUG
