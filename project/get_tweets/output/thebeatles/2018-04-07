I love the @thebeatles Channel on @SIRIUSXM . If you haven't yet listened, you really should.
Let's remember that time when @thebeatles dominated the top five places of Billboard's Hot 100 chart in April, 1964. No one has done it better than them. Of course: they are the mighty #FabFour ! #Beatles #PaulMcCartney #JohnLennon #RingoStarr #GeorgeHarrison #Billboard #Hot100 pic.twitter.com/VagiBxVQ3P

Wow! Just taken my family to see the new version of @thebeatles Love. Saw the original 3 years ago and the changes make the show much better - brighter and louder! My 10 and 12yr olds loved the in-chair sound too. Great job @mashupmartin
