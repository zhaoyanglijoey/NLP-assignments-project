Enjoying a great read on the @thebeatles and their songs by the fire Versailles, MO country... pic.twitter.com/1st1QYcaRJ
Really enjoyed #cillathemusical tonight at @grandtheatrels1 . From singing with @thebeatles at @cavernliverpool to her #TV career. #KaraLilyHayworth was amazing. But my fav songs tonight were #YouveGotToHideYourLoveAway (tears in my eyes to this one) and #californiadreamin pic.twitter.com/8AFvODybaA
https:// youtu.be/g6DVE305g0s DO you REMEMBER when I spoTTed @thebeatles 20ft from me. On a line for miles. Guess that's why I NOW had my quiet time. Where were WE?
Song of the day Lovely Rita - @thebeatles
@Spotify created me the best Daily Mix I could ever ask for - all @thebeatles , @michaeljackson and @bryanadams a total millennial would want.

Right, today was a day. Had to re-learn how to be in groups, if there's a spanner (*spaniard?) in the works. Felt super awkward, checked in with self, learning curve. As they say. #adayinthelife @thebeatles pic.twitter.com/SOV8pwuOxZ

'Kay so,,,, @thebeatles released three new versions of While My Guitar Gently Weeps on Youtube and I gotta say, the acoustic one got me crying like a baby. I miss @GeorgeHarrison so much
A special gift for all @thebeatles fans. https:// hypb.st/r8jez
I'm at final rehearsals for choir concert tomorrow and one of the groups just sang 'Golden Slumbers', I wanted to cry I was so happy that they were singing my favorite song!! I was the only one quietly singing along haha @thebeatles
@thebeatles buenisima banda, pero son eternos segundones
Creo que no has escuchado a @thebeatles
Hear TWO new remixes of While My Guitar Gently Weeps from the upcoming @thebeatles #whitealbum remaster coming out Nov 9 from @UME / Capitol Records Apple in the Brunch Bytes section. @joejohnsononair click here http:// beatlebrunch.com/brunch-bytes/#pic.twitter.com/67drt6zbc5
@thebeatles pathetic........... You wish....... You'll never get in..........
I measure maturity by your favorite @thebeatles artist. Is it @PaulMcCartney ? You're probably a love-lust teen-mind. @johnlennon ? 20's knows everything, can change the world. @GeorgeHarrison ? 30-40's quiet, smart, just doing his thing. Sorry @ringostarrmusic , nobody likes Ringo.
Here comes old flat top @thebeatles
Just covered a popular track by @thebeatles ! Will be uploaded soon! #1965
We've got more previews of @thebeatles White Album anniversary release. @andregardner must be going nuts right now (in a good way). https:// bit.ly/2J6oHqJ

I need to start building up my own music collection. I'm just gonna list some albums I need to buy so I have my own copies. Every @thebeatles album @QueenWillRock Greatest Hits I, II, & III Pet Sounds Thriller The @ninjasexparty albums I don't have Every @RealTenaciousD album
Great news. Red rose Speedway was the nearest @PaulMcCartney release to my birthdate. Grown up loving #Wings and Paul's solo stuff before I even really knew about @thebeatles :D
As if it wasn't already an expensive fall season for @thebeatles fans, now @PaulMcCartney has not one but TWO new deluxe editions on the way! Here comes "Wild Life" and "Red Rose Speedway"! https:// youtu.be/NfLjprd0xxg
