I never realized how much The Moody Blues were channeling @thebeatles vibes on this album while still making their own sound. Also, The Sun Set/Twilight Time is the most badass and underrated track on here imho
100 years later to the day, Leadbelly and fellow @CapitolRecords artists @TheBeachBoys , @thebeatles , and Les Paul were inducted into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall Of Fame.
Gig recap: Learned about colors, talked about @thebeatles , broke a drum head, broke a guitar string, sold merch, body hurts. I am so blessed.

The sounds of @AbbeyRoad filled the halls of #CampAnchor as BeyondFab - a tribute to @thebeatles gave my #Anchor buddies hours of awesome music to dance to. #Anchor was all smiles today - laughter, happiness and good fun.

Rediscovering @thebeatles through the anthology series. As a beatles fan, I dont know how I have managed to overlook it for so long.
A logical mashup. #llap @thebeatles @startrek https://www. instagram.com/p/BeLiZs-hyAI/
Or as much as could be expected from a 35 year old album from a group that's not still growing their fanbase with new music consumers the way @acdc , @thebeatles & @ledzeppelinorg do.

#OnThisDay in 1964, @thebeatles classic album, "Meet The Beatles" was released in the USA. It quickly hit #1 (11 weeks in a row) and has sold over 5 million copies. Widely regarded as one of their best, it includes classic tracks I Wanna Hold Your Hand & I Saw Her Standing There. pic.twitter.com/4zf5NkIU7T
20/01/67 Talking to the boy afterwards he said that when @donovanofficial was arrested for smoking marijuana two of @thebeatles were in the house with him. The police waited outside until #TheBeatles left. Because international stars of their magnitude couldn't be involved...
. @RealRonHoward I know I am late to the party on this but I watched . @thebeatles #EightDaysAWeek last night. I loved it and it also moved me. Such a special film. Are you going to make another film about #TheBeatles ?

Thanks so much, @ACLUNJ . I'm proud of them, too. Despite coming of age before the 1960s and thinking @theBeatles were radical, my parents understand the folly of the drug war. Today they're supporters of both @DFCRorg and @NJU4MR .
It's #InaugurationDay , the #IranHostageCrisis ends and a song by @thebeatles is re-interpreted. #TimeRewind is now boarding for a trip back through the decades to #January20 ! http:// bit.ly/2BfYWyJ #history #popculture #otd
