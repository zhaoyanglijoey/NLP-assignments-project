My 2 favorite bands @BTS_twt & @thebeatles .Both giving in their music a message about love"all you need is love" & self love "I'm the one I should love in this world" isn't beautiful @ringostarrmusic & @PaulMcCartney that music can make a change in this broken world? The is LOVE
We already knew the @thebeatles jerked off together, that's what Revolution 9 WAS.
Reading, for the trillionth time, the late, great Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head. He's so right about some @thebeatles songs, yet SO wrong about others: Day Tripper, genuinely revolutionary, is effectively dismissed. "It isn't very interesting" is positively Chistgau-like
