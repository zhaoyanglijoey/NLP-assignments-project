@taylorswift13 @thebeatles and @stormzy got me through my A Level media. Now I have the knowledge of these 3 for my future.
After an exciting but steady diet of The @thebeatles and Motown (S Robinson, S Wonder, M Gaye), when I bought my first Aretha album, Lady Soul, it was as if another curtain had been lifted and I went to a whole new place. Only one person ever sang the way Aretha sang. R.I.P.
TODAY N HISTORY 1954 @SportsIllustrated is first published by @TimeInc 1962 @TheBeatles fire their first drummer Pete Best & replace him with @RingoStarr 1977 @ElvisPresley dies at his Graceland estate in Memphis, at age 42
so bloke in office doesn't know who Aretha Franklin is. He only got 3 of the @thebeatles he plays video games and is impervious to Western Culture
I'm sure glad you joined @@thebeatles ! You all have had a positive impact on my life. Peace and love @ringostarrmusic
