Of course they're bias you unhinged dickwad. @google is not a news company. They're, at their core, an advertising company. And they're a progressive and forward thinking company that values diversity and inclusion. Totally opposite of you. (But not unlike @BarackObama ) #gohome
Thanks, @BarackObama !
@BarackObama i was wondering if you listen to @BTS_twt music!! what do you think of them <3
The 2nd Quarter GDP was revised UP to 4.2. Put that in your pipe and smoke it @BarackObama

I'M 55 born 18th day April 1963. I was a Republican in the 80s Changed to Democrats for my admiration for @BarackObama Barack I'M really not happy with either side at this time .. You could say I'm an Independent at this point. Both sides needs to. Work harder. Sad pic.twitter.com/6us79ETQ7W
Finished listening to Educated by Tara Westover which was on @BarackObama summer book list and it did not disappoint! So many emotions. Worth the read. #20booksin20weeks

@BarackObama was informed via PDB's #TickTock "We have it all..."
I MISS President @BarackObama SOOOO much!
Just like when the real President @BarackObama named Merrick Garland and everyone came together? Oh wait...
Remember, while @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama were in office the entire human asset groups of the @CIA in China were all assassinated or captured and imprisoned. Coincidence? I don't think so. #MAGA

Thank you @ninaturner for calling out @realDonaldTrump and his minions' racism, while those two white devils pretended to not understand what you were talking about. Why do they try to insult our intelligence like we just became black when @BarackObama was elected? #StayWoke pic.twitter.com/wYlv7hYgGr
ABSOLUTE BS! WE HAVE PROOF OF @FBI , @DOJ , @CIA , @BarackObama and more involved in selling out our nation and attempting to take down @POTUS . What exactly do you have in the way of proof? ...nothing... Get some real news, pal!
@BarackObama will forever be my president.

Puerto Rico has been killing itself, in the last 10 years it has accumulated an unpayable debt! what did the previous admin do to control its debts? NOTHING. Now go cry for @BarackObama .

Congratulations again to @AndrewGillum If your team needs my company @DBTIntl_MRGroup Let me know! We were there (myself personally) during both campaign seasons for @BarackObama District Coral Springs/Parkland so you know it's over 75% #Republican
It's just unbelievable the corruption in our government under @BarackObama ... #SpyGate is the biggest scandal in our country's history!

Hi @BarackObama from Chile!
@BarackObama Amazing too see what young people can do, given the tools.... a change is gonna come
@LarryElder must be a monkey too. @BarackObama said in 2008 that @GOP 'moneys around' with elections. Elder is a Republican. Elder is black. Therefore Obama just called Elder a monkey. https:// youtu.be/PsVNKmb6jEc
@BarackObama could you and the previous living Presidents do anything about the incompetence currently dismantling the Republic.

Now, @realDonaldTrump just called @CNN fake news 30 minutes ago. "S, let's treat this as fake." After all, it really had nothing to do with @POTUS45 , it was @POTUS44 's continued reach. Thank you, @BarackObama !
As usual, Nancy, Cryin Chuck and others who were in office long before @realDonaldTrump DID NOTHING to solve a problem even while they had @BarackObama in office to support them, but conveniently blame the next admin when solutions should have already been in place.

There is no difference. RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA The evil empire has been quiet for some time now. We all are aware that there are spys on both of our sides forever. No one invited them in and did "business" with them, more than that Muslim terr loving, anti-American @BarackObama
@BarackObama Follow me
All thanks to President @BarackObama ....
Half of 'this', half of 'that', but still a full blown joke.. @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/LWbwXniREo
Those look like promotions. @BarackObama and his team knew how to use social media to promote. You only know how to bash....
Hear it directly from Chicagoans: @BarackObama and community leaders explain what building the Obama Presidential Center means for the South Side of Chicago. pic.twitter.com/7apxPJcBX2
So nice to hear a nice, self-assured human being saying positive things to other nice human beings, not because they say nice things about you, but because truly nice, truly smart and truly aspirational people just do things like that with no strings attached. @BarackObama

You are a true leader, @BarackObama . We miss you leading this country. However, thank you for continuing to inspire our youth.
Love to see a side by side with @MichaelAvenatti & @BarackObama . That would be pretty close to political perfection
@AdeleRoberts it's pretty awesome that @BarackObama follows you

Why is she being stopped from coming to Australia to speak? Chelsea Manning was pardoned by no less than @BarackObama does anyone serious think that he would pardon anyone who was not a fit and proper person to be granted a visa to come to Aust, simply RWRN LNP Police State
@BarackObama You're followed in Canada too!
I smile at the thought of President @BarackObama delivering a eulogy to @SenJohnMcCain Saturday at a funeral you are not even allowed to attend. Two men admired and loved, you are despised, Obama a brilliant orator you can not form a coherent sentence. Go golfing you sad excuse!
No surprise....When people CREATE great VALUE they get well compensated. Thank you @BarackObama !!
@BarackObama said his mom was afraid to walk by a group of black men.Also went after every police office who shot a black person. Talk about racism Obama divider in chief of what did he say? Another racist remark These United States which was used during the civil war.
How much do I LOVE @BarackObama Let me count the ways
@BarackObama Follow me
2/ @BillClinton @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama are buddy buddy with Jamie Dimon. He has been instrumental in having regulations rescinded, and this is while the democrats were in the White House. Just keep that in mind.
@realDonaldTrump you'll always be the popular vote loser & it must kill you that @BarackObama has 60,000,000 more twitter followers than you.
Sir @BarackObama , could you if you can please visit my high school in 2020 when I graduate because you kept me going. I loved the 8 years you were president. The best since I was alive. Thank you even if you can't. I go to @hooverhigh29
maybe this sounds weird but I genuinely miss @BarackObama and the sound of his speaking voice. it was so smooth and soothing, but also very confident, very attractive, very human sounding. the kind of voice that makes you want to get up and do something.
Trader or traitor? Nevermind, it doesn't matter.... @BarackObama was neither. But @realDonaldTrump , that guy IS definitely a #traitor !!
Thanks, @BarackObama .
Congratulations on hitting the best growth since @BarackObama did it. Now talk about how real wages are dropping and healthcare costs are continuing to skyrocket.
Check out my classroom on @DonorsChoose ! We are looking to expand our STEM knowledge at our school. I'd love your help to bring my project to life: https:// donorschoo.se/e/wSS0iBzWMP Right now all donations are being doubled thanks to @craignewmark #stemstories #stem @BarackObama
If only the same thing happened with @BarackObama . Kinda funny the same authorities bestowed upon a POTUS were viewed differently just 4 years ago. Go figure.
#Democrats what say you. @BarackObama @SenFeinstein @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi pic.twitter.com/Dc64s5fPKh
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS described @RonDeSantisFL as a "tough cookie" not even as nails. So we will watch that cookie crumble and turn FL Blue! We won't allow a racist to govern this state. Fingers crossed everyone comes out to vote in Nov, like they did for @BarackObama
. @marthamaccallum You are losing viewers on . @FoxNews because you have idiots like . @TheJuanWilliams on your show. He is divisive like . @BarackObama
I guess @CynthiaNixon didn't hear @BarackObama when he said "healthcare is complicated."
the @TheDemocrats better hurry up and get rid of @realDonaldTrump before the economy and our country get too good or they'll never be able to drag it back to the @BarackObama mess they ruled.
If @BarackObama ain't on the campaign trail with @AndrewGillum SOON.... He needs to book his reservation pic.twitter.com/olBosfzDFb
We miss you @BarackObama @MichelleObama
He needed someone to make him look good, so why not bring in the Chief of corruption, the lie master himself @BarackObama
@BelichickThis @BarackObama would swat that weak shit into the 8th row. #NotInMyHouse
So you are saying thank you very much to @BarackObama for a great recovery from the great #recession that was cause by the previous #Republican #President ? How are regular #American people benefiting from this? #Corruption #RussianColusion #ObstructionOfJustice #LiarInChief #Fail
Stop race baiting! Trump nor Desantis are racist. You people are racist by associating the word monkey with black people & that is what's offensive. Please though....keep saying you want to impeach Trump! It fires up his base. @BarackObama caused division and so do you. #DeSantis
2 major stores, Toys r us, and FAO Schwartz closed under @BarackObama Now, FAO is reopening under @potus Trump.

@JustJo007 is @BarackObama really following you?
@BarackObama @MeghanMcCain @JoeBiden @MichelleObama @laurawbush Just a crazy idea, sing Battle Hymn of the Republic during @SenJohnMcCain 's eulogy. Do the Country proud & give us our soul back!
another thing @BarackObama didn't do during his term. Too many suggestions, not enough force of law. What is the lesson? @TheDemocrats must STOP FEARING THEIR ACTIONS. no longer should they try to kiss butt, but instead say "this is the way". @gop has no problem doing it.
There is only one @BarackObama but @BetoORourke will be Beto and that's quite good enough.
No It was all about Obama and preserving his legacy. Hillary was just the puppet. @BarackObama . To late.
Like your source on @BarackObama 's birth certificate? We actually stopped listening to you way before that.

I really do believe you need to just put Tuck in charge of all domestic intelligence. He seems to be saying exactly what you want to hear with the dozens of times you quote him How he missed getting any charges filed against @BarackObama while he was in office is astounding!
@rolandsmartin did you see @PastorDScott tried to Fist-Bump' Donald J Trump? & Trump shook Scott's fist instead, probably saying, get that @BarackObama Fist-Bump out of here. Scott, Eisenhower was President when I was born & Robert F. Wagner was Mayor of NYC when will You grow up
I saw a couple teenagers fighting the other day one black one white, I almost stopped to break it up. Then I realized @BarackObama wasn't POTUS anymore and they were laughing and joking.
Somebody tell him that @BarackObama can do it for 6 minutes!!
@BarackObama Hello from Oregon, Mister Obama!
