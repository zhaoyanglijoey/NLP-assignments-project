You realise you're projecting the failings of republicans, right? Also I'd much rather look at @BarackObama instead of the lying, evil, moron, conjob you have in trump, as he, trump, in record time has destroyed america & the world really IS laughing AT america because of trump!
@BarackObama OBAMA WYD FOLLOWING A THORKI SHIPPER
@BarackObama You failed at every turn in foreign policy. You need to shut up and quit trying to undermine President Trump. You had your chance and squandered it. Shame on you.
@BarackObama Today it was said that you are talking bad of America, again. One needs to heed our nation. Support America don't tear it down.
All started under @BarackObama , the community organizer & Divider in Chief. Obama purposely spread hate & division throughout his 8 years & divided this Republic in every way possible. - By race/skin color, gender, religion, class/wealth, occupation, age, party affiliation, etc..
@BarackObama What's a girl got to do to get a follow back? #whynotme
@BarackObama Obama you failed America you were a failure remember that every day.

When the Democrats regain power, the first SC nominee should be none other than @BarackObama .
@BarackObama never, ever saluted like that? You know why? Because he hated the US military!!
Destruction of our democracy? That began with your savior @BarackObama and only now are we returning to the Constitution upon which this democracy was founded
President @BarackObama did more for the United States of America in the 8 years he served the country than what fake "president" @realDonaldTrump is doing ... In his first term of office ... Am I the only one who sees this ??? Am I really the only one ??? #MakeAmericaWhatAgain ??

The SARCASM is directed at @BarackObama 's assertion on the 2016 campaign trail that Trump would cause an economic disaster (I'm paraphrasing, of course). It turns out Obama was wrong; and instead of saying Trump did a good job, he now suggests Trump is riding his coattails?

Stop lying about Bart being accused of a sex ring, that's not what was reported!! pic.twitter.com/OU75MY1rut
Or it's like @BarackObama teaching a college class on foreign trade. Or @HillaryClinton opening a soup kitchen that feeds small children instead of serves them. Wait, that last one was a bit too much...of the truth. #sorrynotsorry #Qanon #ThesePeopleAresick
#Americans Check out what our PM @jacindaardern 's said at the UN. 3ven @BarackObama was #nationalistic #lite and all about imperialism in his time.
#KavanaughHearings #FordKavanaugh From a #PR and political point of view it is worth remembering that the #GOP didn't even give the Scotus nominee of @BarackObama a hearing. So the GOP is upset over the Dems bringing up Ford, but they forget they wouldn't give Garland a hearing.
Yes, why don't you?? Are you afraid of the #ClintonCartel ? I've prayed for justice for Ambassador Stevens and the others @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama had murdered and injured during 13 hours of hell in Benghazi. #Benghazi #NeverForget

Danielle Metz (sentence commuted by @BarackObama ) tells about the difficulty of fighting her life sentence because there was violence involved in her conspiracy charges. Talking about the judge, "he treated me like I was an animal." #FreeHer2018
@BarackObama lying piece of shit traitor
They won't. "The end justifies the means". Rules for Radicals, by hater of capitalism, Saul Alinsky. Favorite book of @BarackObama

Of course @BarackObama has also made very big mistakes+e.g. was a crusher of int. law. But I am firmly convinced that if he had been white and not black, the Republicans would not have tried to fight the presidency with such hateful extremism. That totally poisoned the climate.

I knew how badly @BarackObama and @BillClinton failed us, but I never fully realized how much George W and George H W Bush failed us until now. When we have a doer like @realDonaldTrump in office, all others pale greatly in comparison.
@BarackObama Not gonna happen A-Hole!
@SenFeinstein The @BarackObama era was the most "adventurous" time in my life. Tell @HillaryClinton and the rest of your Democrat friends I said "What's up? God bless you. Still alive and free." You understand me? Y'all have y'all's job and we have ours. Good luck.
. @AndrewGillum is a phony. He's like @BarackObama , if Barry's mother was African American.
. @BarackObama giving advice to entrepreneurs? Laughable. He's never built anything, never hired anyone... just became wealthy by being a professional politician... yet had the balls to tell entrepreneurs that they didn't build their businesses. https:// youtu.be/YKjPI6no5ng
@BarackObama @SenSchumer @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TheDemocrats None of this would have happen if @senatemajldr had done his freaking constitutional obligations and provided a fair hearing for #MerrickGarland ! We must never forget this!
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC , EIGHT YEARS OF RACIST REPUBLICAN OBSTRUCTION of @BarackObama is the most DESPICABLE thing I have seen during YOUR time in politics. So fuck off about Democrats not wanting a lying, sex offending CREEP on the Supreme Court.

What's interesting is that you guys tried for years, with zero evidence, to convince America that @BarackObama was not born in this country, but now you are deeply vigilant against the perils of false accusations. Do you ever make yourself physically ill with your own hypocrisy?

Yes, Trump does know something about business, as opposed to @BarackObama . It was #Oblome 's regs and policies that created the "new norm" of 2% growth. Just 2 years and fewer regs, new policies, and lower taxes we are kicking 4%'s butt! Go figure Barry. https://www. westernjournal.com/?p=687793
This grifter @maziehirono is picking Hawaiians' pockets like the grand grifter @BarackObama who has amassed wealth from corruption and the swindle of other people's money.
@davidplouffe What? It's the global elite who cannot rise. Isn't that what the @BarackObama was pushing for? As he said, " we will transform America." And he meant it, and it wasn't for the better!
I was thinking about that exact same thing. If I could meet @BarackObama I would tell him how much he is missed and cry too.
@realDonaldTrump What needs to happen is Publishing houses who give huge million dollar payouts for Globalist allegiance ( @JeffFlake , @BarackObama & more ) under the guise of writing a mediocre sales-proof book, should be investigated under the RICO Act.

Kavanaugh already voted in 2017 to reject a 17 yr old in TX from getting an abortion and was overruled by the other 2 judges. He will break up Roe v Wade as quick as he can @BarackObama please talk to Pres Bush about Gamble V US! We need your help, Kavanaugh will make 45 a Putin
Um, @BarackObama has 102 million followers
has, HE IS NOT THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB! @BarackObama Please DON'T keep giving the public your push for Kavanaugh, it is dangerous for not only us women who are victims but the US rule of law.
