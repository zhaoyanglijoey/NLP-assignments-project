@BarackObama
Hey @BarackObama i guess that magical wand that you claimed @realDonaldTrump had was real.
I their defense, they called @BarackObama a traitor for simply having the nerve to get himself elected President.
Oversaturated with the news right now. Tuning it out and reading @brhodes ', The World As It Is. I miss @BarackObama - a thoughtful, compassionate and intelligent human being.
A dose of reality.. Thank you @BarackObama for all of your hard work. You saved our nation from an almost insurmountable financial meltdown with grace and style.. Perfect.? Absolutely not. No one among us is.. But your heart is unmistakable.. Thank you for all that you have done pic.twitter.com/FC3ogZPUGj
@Potus Did @BarackObama open our financial system to the #Iranians ?? Whats being done about it? @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi @SecPompeo @StateDept
George I'm having trouble finding your tweet on @BarackObama getting played when he gave billions and set crazy long lead times to inspect with the Iran nuclear deal? O that's right u didn't, but an agreement where we didn't give a country billions, got hostages back u criticize!

Hahahah that how useless @BarackObama was
@EricHolder @BarackObama this is worse than anyone ever imagined, right? What they have destroyed in 20 months (and continue to destroy) will take years and years to rebuild. At home and abroad.
Where was your cry when @BarackObama did the EXACT same thing?

There was never more class in the WH than when @BarackObama & @MichelleObama lived there. I SO wish they were still there!!
How is anyone criticizing @realDonaldTrump when @BarackObama not only gave Billions to Iran but Hundreds of Millions to Palestine on his last day in office??? We are talking about funding terrorist here!
the next exercise was scheduled for Jan '19. More than enough time to load up and start again if N. Korea deal fails. Don't recall this much oversight on @BarackObama Iran scam
Oh @BarackObama lmao
. @realdonaldtrump Sir, Let me help you illustrate what has happened with unemployment. Please RT these graph so Mr. DeNiro can see it and learn his lesson: Unemployment rate 2009-2018 Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics @BLS_gov That will teach him! cc: @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/zABhqnxH2W
@BarackObama We miss you.
That also is fake news since Benghazi was never given the extra Marines requested. We have a twisted sense of priorities, sadly. Like WTH no diplomat on the trigger happy Korean Peninsula? We had one with @BarackObama
Hard to say how I'd react since @BarackObama didn't do anything with DPRK except kick the can.
Thanks @BarackObama
Thank you @BarackObama for reviving the economy. You prevented the dotard from filing another bankruptcy.

@BarackObama heard you met with Mitch Landrieu.....he failed here inNOLA....ask him about the Pumps?????? His past will follow him to Washington...and you waisted your Presidency!
Joe think it might be a wee-bit better than giving them Millions of dollars to fund their nuclear program? Or @BarackObama giving Iran Billions to develop theirs AND Palestine hundreds of Millions??? ARE you on the SAME PLANET as the rest of us?
@BarackObama Absolutely nothing in *8* years! Something YOU can NOT take credit for. Eat your black heart out!!! pic.twitter.com/9vXKOBKEZs
So @realDonaldTrump basically okayed NK dictator actions saying (and I'm paraphrasing) ...he had to be ruff, and called him smart. God forbid @BarackObama sympathized with a dictator or okayed them, there would be an uproar.The hypocrisy in this country is astounding. #Summit
Check out the name on this @Facebook post attacking @BarackObama None of the Trump supporters responding question it, they just say yes, yes, yes like sheep. Tell them Russia interfered in their vote and they'll be offended *sigh* pic.twitter.com/Oi9Cd7yUO6

Agreed. Thank you, @BarackObama !
@NobelPrize Come on guys...you all gave @BarackObama an Nobel for being the 1st African to become a US President. @realDonaldTrump has been kicking ass & taking names. Please give him the recognition that he & his Administration deserves. God bless. #MAGA #Trump2020 #AmericaFirst
You mean when @BarackObama released 5 terrorists & a traitor. Then paid the terrorist to release a prisoner?
Wondering if @BarackObama can make some calls and get me a Canadian citizenship. #TrumpKim

If you have to invite a politician there are more thoughtful choices across the political spectrum; @BenSasse , @BarackObama @JohnKasich etc

Thanks @BarackObama
During the '08 campaign, when @BarackObama proposed trying what Trump is pretending he acheived yesterday, every Republican roundly criticized him. Thanks for your participation in the Pretend History Didn't Happen sweepstakes.
It was still ihoP when @BarackObama was president....just sayin though
Yes, @BarackObama was a great President! He did a great job and America is now reaping the rewards.
Don't worry shitbrain. No one is paying attention to all the videos on social media of you ranting against @BarackObama for suggesting he might meet with enemies of the US.

Hey, I don't agree with most of what @realDonaldTrump does but if we move forward with North Korea, he gets credit. A broken clock is correct twice a day. Wishing him nothing but failure is what @SenateMajLdr did to @BarackObama and is treason.
How many people right now think that @BarackObama is saying, wtf @realDonaldTrump is making it look so hard, NOT!! #MAGA#TRUMP2020
@BarackObama Thinks Dennis Rodman is Stupid and not worth an Ear.
You just wonder what it will take to remove the blinders from some people! How many people at @FBI will have to be indicted, fired or resign before people realized the @BarackObama team attempted to take down a sitting president!
What the Fuck is this? @SenSchumer and all these Dems are complaining about @realDonaldTrump and they have allowed @BarackObama fund a terrorists state against our ally! Dems need to be tried for treason!!!!

Obama got 40 million from Netflix for pushing net neutrality. @BarackObama
I know I saw that too. He said @BarackObama pushed him aside and didn't want to hear about it several times!
You also abrogated our agreement with Iran, which had more substance (although I think we should help them with solar technology, not nuclear technology, for energy). So, to spite @BarackObama it would seem, you traded one agreement with some teeth for an unrelated one with none.
Thanks to @BarackObama
Thanks @BarackObama
Shucks, pound the Dems more: In early 2006, this wild mustang who delivered a jaw-dropping speech at DNC in 2004--some unknown named @BarackObama --began campaigning on a strong platform. He won. Say, Dems...where ya at today, two years before next pres election? *crickets*
Dear @BarackObama your country misses you
Virtually every single positive economic indicator is following a trend established during the @BarackObama administration. And he didn't have to purposefully slash revenues and introduce $1 trillion deficits. #resign #corrupt #RussiaPuppet
Hey @BarackObama , This is Treason! You can think about this from your future jail cell!
Maybe, the point is that . @POTUS did NOT DO all of THIS HIMSELF? A GREAT BIG THANKS goes to . @BarackObama who set up the economy FOR YOU! And, YOU have NOT SCREWED it up - YET. But, TARIFFS & DEREGS (esp. banks) are working toward the next . @GOP financial crisis!
Better than making your money in politics and cashing in later like @HillaryClinton , @BillClinton and @BarackObama
@BarackObama knew what time it was.
Thank you @BarackObama for building up our economy! Donald how soon can we get rid of you? You are an embarrassment to our country! You are the destroyer of all that is good! #ResignNow
Because the GOP, the Evangelicals, nearly EVERYONE tore @BarackObama a new one for even SUGGESTING he'd meet with NK
He was just stating what the majority of Americans feel. As you WELL KNOW it was @BarackObama who graciously set the table for you and the economics of the country. Believe or not Mr. DeNIro cares about people and way they are treated in this country..he's not a bigot like U
@BarackObama Mr. President Emeritus Hope you and the First Lady Emeritus @MichelleObama and the young ladies are doing well. When are your books coming out?
@BarackObama we are waiting for you in Kogelo ... hope this time round we will meet.
What did @BarackObama ever do that needed any scrutiny? Other than play golf?
If @BarackObama can get a a Nobel Peace Prize for his existence then @dennisrodman deserves two for potentially ending the Korean War.
How long is the ride going to last on the coat tails of an already climbing economy thanks to @BarackObama ? Enjoy it Fukwad. You seem to think you are the man.. You're not even close. PS.. your new little buddy called you a Dotard, do you even know what that means? #IDIOT

. #WRONGagain !!! #President @BarackObama didn't get a raise during his 2 terms. He also wouldn't have accepted a raise when the majority of #Americans had stagnant wages. #IllegitimatePresident @realDonaldTrump wouldn't hesitate to accept a raise. No guarantee HE'LL keep donating!
WRONG!! If @BarackObama had actually tried to do something other than divide America & bow down to other countries, & apologize for the simple fact that we're Americans...then he would have gotten more support from BOTH sides. But, nice try though
Marc, ask Trump for a pardon to come back to the USA as a free man because @BarackObama put you in jail. Stop White on White crime today! Never dance with the devil because you will get burned.. #FuckTrump

what do you think @BarackObama haha???
You @brhodes @JohnKerry and the @BarackObama team should have enough self awareness not to criticize. Your Iran negotiation and deal was terrible even before the lies were exposed. Killing Cassandra. License to our banking system. Lies and more lies to cover terrible negotiation.

Were you saying the same@thing when @BarackObama said he would engage with advisories during the 2008 election? I think the answer is no. Partisanship > principals for @LindseyGrahamSC . Real leadership.
. @BarackObama had some pretty solid diplomatic achievements - but I seem to recall plenty of naysayers on the @GOP side. Also, it was a nice photo opp, but the proof is going to be in the follow up. Since no inspections were agreed to, how will we verify?

Thanks @BarackObama
De Niro's IQ is most likely higher than yours...but that aside. You inherited a very good economy and a low unemployment rate for everyone inc. whites, latinos and African Americans. @BarackObama inherited depression levels unemployment and economy. Oh, the collective amnesia!
It still amazes me that we can go from the worst president in modern history @barackobama for a grueling eight years, to the greatest president @potus we probably have ever seen.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @seanhannity et al: Remember when @BarackObama wanted to reach out to #KimJongUn , and you excoriated him in typical partisan fashion, criticising the very idea as treasonous? Now that @realDonaldTrump has done the same thing, you're his #CockHolster

Just take Obama's (who got one for TALKING about ending a conflict) and give it to @realDonaldTrump for actually ( ENDING a conflict? ) - at least closer than @BarackObama ever tried to. - TAKING FROM THOSE WHO HAVE & GIVING TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT! - ( The Liberal way )
Are you sure about that buddy, since @POTUS got rid of all @BarackObama job killing regulations?
Or.... @BarackObama didn't push for a face to face with Kim because of the reasons the media (Not Fake News) has been citing.
lol! @paulkrugman has really lost his marbles! Go join your fellow shyster Nobel laureate @BarackObama in @netflix you bozo.
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton Trump does something neither of you 2 nitwits could do and like the cowards you are you say nothing positive. This is great for this country. Yea I know your pathetic jealousy won't let you. Your both sick in the head
