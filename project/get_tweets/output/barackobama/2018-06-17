Remember when liberals and #fakenews media barraged @realDonaldTrump with calumny on #familyseparations , using photos of children in cages? It turned out those photos were taken in 2014 when @BarackObama was prez and they deleted their posts, didn't lambast #Obama .

@BarackObama Happy Fathers Day, Mr. Obama! Malia and Sasha are lucky to have you as a dad, and were were lucky to have you as President!
So many people complaining about the immigration policies. Why didn't they complain when the same policies were in place during the @BarackObama administration? They are all suffering from a bad case of selective memory.
Thanks @BarackObama Hang in there @POTUS your economy is coming. It's starting with the pork industry. Right now though....you've been coasting on Obama's coattails.
It's going to take a lot of work to undo the damage done by @BarackObama but @realDonaldTrump seems to have it well in hand. #MAGA and KEEP it that way!
@BarackObama @BarackObama mr liar USA pay back is a bitch
How many pedos were a the @BarackObama speech in Belgium in 2014 How many kids got hurt that night #QAnon #NowComesThePain
@BarackObama
Well said. Still waiting for him to address where the outrage was when traitor @BarackObama locked kids in cages.
Why would @realDonaldTrump write the most perfect tweet in the history of Twitter, about the first PUBLIC piece of proof @BarackObama is a liar, forcing him to respond, it soared with likes shortly after, and then deleted it. @zachhaller if you got any suggestions, I am ALL EARS.

@BarackObama I am a U.S. citizen. I had rights under The Constitution, rights that have been pummeled. I almost died from this nonsense and people using your voice playing as you in the state of MO. My father was murdered, my son is missing. Are you aware of what's been done?
Happy Fathers Day, Dad! @BarackObama
This is incredibly inspiring.,, @BuzzFeedNews @TheEllenShow @Oprah @BuzzFeedIndia @FoxNews @VP @BarackObama

@BarackObama deported over 2 Million illegals, and also said the need to learn English if the come to this Country for Citizenship, So you All have several seats @johnlegend @realDonaldTrump
Yes, thank GOD almighty. But do tell us your thoughts on his policies. Tell us how loud were you all crying when @BarackObama did it.
@BarackObama did I miss your Happy Father's Day tweet to Frank Marshall Davis? Dang.
@BarackObama so sad that you did not help African Americans - you had the opportunity to change history and you let everyone down.

So @BarackObama @GOP @TheDemocrats @RepTomMarino care to comment?
Now they have a taste for the 8 years under @BarackObama
@BarackObama was supposed to fix healthcare not set up the people to fail with mandatory insurance (which is in the Financial sector) and sign the fucking Marino bill
He was committed to civil rights. Met Mandela, @BarackObama & went to both his inaugurations. Was the only "non-black" person to give a standing ovation for Darryl Hunt (RIP too) at my graduation (that really stuck with me)
Wow @BarackObama #opioidcrisis #60Minutes shameful sickening to watch this Thank you @CBSNews for exposing this
the left has forgotten or never really cared that @BarackObama deported more illegal immigrants then Bush / Clinton + Trump combined. #wherewasthemediathen @CNNPolitics @ABC @MSNBC
Thanks @BarackObama President Obama!!
For my favorite dad joke teller, Happy Father's day @BarackObama P.s. America loves, misses, and needs you!!!
@NBCNews was to busy kissing @BarackObama ass to even consider that his regime was doing the separation of parents
@BarackObama I miss you :(
Commentary on the news Monday: why all of a sudden are @democrats concerned about family separation? Same separation at border happened under @BarackObama . It happens every day when parents commit crimes. Hypocrites? Political Games? Fake compassion? 7:54 AM 1:54 PM on @KMJNOW .
Ya know Edward Kennedy had @RepJoeKennedy in mind when he backed @BarackObama Step Up Bruh Its Time
For the record, @BarackObama could have reversed it as well, and never did in eight years. Where was your outrage then?
Trump slammed @BarackObama two days ago on Twitter for lying when he said he found out about her private email address the same time everyone else did. He said people wants to know the truth. He wrote @BarackObama. Then he deleted the tweet. No spelling errors, 10K+ likes. Why?

Is it too much to ask that Presidents Carter, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama speak out against this cruel policy of separating children from parents seeking refuge in America? @CarterCenter @43georgebush @presbillclinton @BarackObama #UnAmericanUnChristian
Here is my thing why can't you and all of the former Presidents get together and do something. There has to be something you all can do. @BarackObama

Yeah... as started by you and the @BarackObama administration... nice effort to avoid acknowledging the findings of the #IGReport tho
Do you notice? Instead of outrage by @GOP and #Cult45 over children being ripped from their parents... They attack @BarackObama They blame Democrats. They claim the children are criminals. They blame the parents for seeking asylum. But not once, Not Once- Do they fix it.

Children were taken from families and then called "unaccompanied" as a part of DACA in the @BarackObama admin.

. @BarackObama 1st term was as tough on immigrants as trumps first year. Obama down played the aggressiveness & stated ICE was going after felons But it was not until 2014 when restrictive guidelines were set on ICE. Another example how obama put the dems to sleep
