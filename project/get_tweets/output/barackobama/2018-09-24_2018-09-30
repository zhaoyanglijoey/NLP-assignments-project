I just started reading The Audacity of Hope by @BarackObama and am listening to the audio version. It's somewhat comforting to hear his voice and listen to his words.

I would like to come out after 40 years to let everyone know that @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton exposed themselves to me some time at some place and there was others there too! I can not be sure if it was them or not but I know it was them I had a memory relapse told me so.
"Voting is the small step that each of us takes to make things better" Thanks @BarackObama and @jonfavs for the inspiring words on the last episode of #TheWilderness I was surprised by how calming it was to hear The President's voice again...

Had @BarackObama not screwed over our military, then we could have maintained what we had to make them last longer, as well as purchased replacement helicopters along the way so the cost wasn't as high to do them all at once.

@BarackObama had the upper hand here. Wish Congress would have never passed legislation limiting presidents to two terms early in the 20th century. Obama would still be leading our nation if there were no term limits. I know this statement is open to all kinds of responses.
Strength on the world stage? You bet @BarackObama had it. This orange clown is the butt of the world's joke....
@BarackObama and @MichelleObama are both out campaigning for The Corrupt DEEP STATE. Hummmm.....? Did that for the 2016 election, yet had ABSOLUTLY NO IMPACT. Why do they think 2018 would be different? More Americans have washed their hands of the Democrats than ever in 2018?
Hey stupid, our economy was in the tank when @BarackObama rescued us from another Great Depression. You should study that since I doubt you know anything about history.
At least now there is an uncertain path whereas before time, there was really no path at all, previous administrations had no balls to take head on the issue with North Korea except President Trump! @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama

No drama @BarackObama .
You refuse to see: @BarackObama brought character, decency, love & understanding to the White House; a committed husband & father; well-educated; loved by so many Americans, especially children. And dogs. Your orange shitbomb squatting in the White House can't match him. At all.

@BarackObama had 8 years both House and Senate for a few of those and still didn't accomplish much of anything. I am glad @SenateMajLdr McConnell held that SCOTUS seat after the scam perpetrated on the American people called Obamacare.
So grateful that the Former President @BarackObama came to Philly. He felt honor bound to campaign so he could endorse other candidates. #KnowHisWorth #WhosTeamWillUBeOnInNovember #RiseUpAndTakeControl

@MichelleObama we did not have a good president prior to @realDonaldTrump . Being an apologist in chief and leading from behind is not an effective way to be President. And I wake up happy knowing that @BarackObama is no longer President and @HillaryClinton will not be President.
@MichelleObama 's donkey husband @BarackObama can be blamed for most of the hate and vitriol in this country.
Thank you @democratliars , thank you @kamelaharris , thank you @diannefeinstein , thank you @corybooker , thank you @barackobama , thank you @hillaryclinton . For helping the Republicans gain further strength by being the lying cheats that will eventually destroy the Democrat Party.
God loves everybody. Nobody has the legal right to murder someone else. @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton Rip salvation. 2020 I'm running for President to better America. Opportunity is promised. The death penalty is wickedness. 7703624961 is my number.

hey he is a jerk...but sure is getting a heck of a lot more accomplished than @BarackObama whose foreign policy sure did not work in N Korea........
Graham, you are an idiot. If Kavanaugh is a dirty judge. McConnell did not want him in the first place. We have zero tolerance for the GOP smearing of Barack @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton . We will also never forget: MERRICK GARLAND.
Yeah, what a setup! Look at how many times @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama went on Fox and took interview requests from the few publications/outlets with opposing views. Oh, wait. Never mind.
@BarackObama The current president "doesn't do" baby birth greetings. Could you send my new son one? (we have one for our daughter from you and Mrs. Michelle).
Wearing my @AMarch4OurLives shirt, just put down @SenGillibrand book, listening to @jonfavs & @BarackObama episode of The Wilderness & the @DNC just called me ALL while on my way to send my absentee ballot... this is the best perfect storm since climate change started doing those
So apparently a former president can become vp and a former vp can become president. So all we have to do is get @realDonaldTrump impeached get @BarackObama and @JoeBiden to run again and then we avoid ww4 for at least 4 more years.

From the man who made sure the @GOP sat on their hands while @BarackObama 's administration brought the economy back to life after the 2007-8 Financial Crisis, refused to even have a hearing for #Garland , and refused to offer bipartisan message against #Russian influence campaigns
@SenMajLdr , you hypocritical scumbag. YOU blocked @BarackObama 's @Scotus pick, Merrick Garland, and YOU have the fking audacity to act as if @SenateDems sink as low as you?!! AND, you're refusing an @FBI investigation into attempted rape. #fratboyprivilege
It is extremely sad & also telling of the character of both @MichelleObama & @BarackObama that they learned nothing from George W. & Laura Bush after they left the WH...I guess dignity, decorum, grace & tradition are only held in high regard by past Republican POTUS' & FLOTUS'!
Studies have shown that if @BarackObama were Constitutionally allowed to run again today, he would win. Hands down. No other Political Opponent would even come close. Another reason he is our last TRUE President.

Everything about @POTUS is false. It's obvious he learned nothing from @BarackObama , a #GreatPOTUS44 He has class, dignity, honor, integrity, honesty, patriotism, energy, sanity, & he deserves all the respect in the world. Donald Trump receives the respect he deserves: LAUGHTER
She doesn't care to understand. A LOT of people don't. That's what made @SenJohnMcCain 's rebuff of that woman who called @BarackObama "an Arab" that much more admirable. He knew it might turn off his base, and he did it anyway.

It's called mental illness.... Very sad. @BarackObama made them so entitled that now, they think the world revolves around them. It did with the shitty previous pres, but not now. They have no sense of reality but this IS happening. @POTUS is fixing it #MAGA
@SenateDems @SpeakerRyan @BarackObama My salary did not paid because of @moonriver365 @GH_PARK 's ordered to Incheon citizen..... President Trump aided n aid @moonriver365 n @GH_PARK Therefore, i can't support President Trump.

Thank @BarackObama for the economic success that Trump also likes to think he had something to do with. You promote the same self-serving deregulated tax giveaway bubble growth policies Obama had to get us out of in 2008 preventing a crash. #TrumpTreason #BlueWave #FBR pic.twitter.com/V08LLjET1L
Or just go visit our soldiers' gravesites or go visit a vet who lost their limbs in Iraq thanks to Iran - terrorists likely used some of the $150B cash flown in by @BarackObama . We voted for @realDonaldTrump to shut down ISLAMIC TERRORISM

Remember when @barackobama & @HillaryClinton cared so much about our planet they made a surprise visit to the climate policy party between China, India & other developing nations in Copenhagen? Good times. pic.twitter.com/3Zygc6F1fn
@BarackObama do everything in your power to change this presidency and bring us back to stability. This is not good. I'm a real person and refuse this leadership. Please talk to whoever you know.
So much to take in and hopefully, I will quickly dump out of my brain as trash. Did he say @BarackObama had his finger on 'the button' and he swooped in to save the world? #TrumpPressConference

Guys...just finished the finale of The Wilderness. @BarackObama hit me with all the feels, and, just like he did 10 years ago, left me with all the hope.
Glenn Beck lied when he went on Faux news and said @POTUS44 , @BarackObama had a deep seated hate for white people. @TedNugent called @HillaryClinton vile and disgusting names that he would not want used against his wife or mother. Two fake patriots
@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I'm so proud of President Obama! Today you spoke in Norway about so important things. It was intelligent, knowledgeable, the list goes on. I'm inspired by the Obamas! Trump, you're a disgrace ! You're the laughingstock! You're a crook!
@BarackObama you say you did so much, yet the jobs left the country and you told people to get over it, and then we were deplorables and now the dregs @JoeBiden of life. We are the average Americans! @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT! ASK @senatemajldr why @BarackObama had so many judicial vacancies. He'll tell you!
Paging @BarackObama : @RealMaximeWest is describing you perfectly. Keep trying Max you might end up with one of the crackerjack medal from Obama
@BarackObama will you come to my school or just to my house so I can hug you and listen to your plans for the future and how to change the world for the better
I remember when you clowns were complaining about the same thing during Barry @BarackObama Soetoro's 8 yr reign of error...NOT...
Having a hard time falling asleep, will someone please read me a @BarackObama speech? works better than counting democrats, oh I mean sheep.
@BarackObama will you ever grow a pair
I tried watching the #TrumpPressConference , but couldn't get all the way through the incomprehensible babbling, ranting and sidestepping. So I looked up some of @BarackObama 's pressers and found one from Feb. of 2010, even earlier in his 1st term, and OMG, HOW DID WE GET HERE?!
@BarackObama You're worried about the environment, eh? That why you created this second, even more dangerous cold war, quit negotiating with Putin and haven't told Democrats they should let Trump negotiate with Putin?

@BarackObama are you going to let go what trump today said you said about NK and what you were going to do??
@BarackObama And change your profile. You AIN'T THE PRESIDENT ANY MORE. (Well you weren't really one in the first place).
@BarackObama Thoughts on the last 48 hours?
You do realize that your time is up. You're washed up waste of 8 years. Trying to be relevant after the fact, based on your destruction of this country is an insult to America's intelligence. Go do something creative like keeping your daughters legs closed. @BarackObama

Trump when asked if he saw @BarackObama 's speech " I'm sorry I was watching then I fell asleep"
Our President's views on abuse and sexual assault deeply impact their lives; They used to have hope, resolve to move forward They are 11 and 12, by the way, and believe they no longer have any advocate in their corner @RoyCooperNC @MichelleObama @BarackObama
Are you watching an old @BarackObama presser? Because the one I am watching clearly features an elderly white man with delusions of grandeur and an elementary grasp of world affairs who may be suffering from dementia.
@BarackObama Please come to Texas and support Beto. People think Texas will stay red but Beto is giving Cruz a hard run. Beto reminds me a lot of one of the best POTUS ever....you!

Keep in mind, @BarackObama 's warning to Trump about NK was probably traumatizing to @realDonaldTrump , since, at the time, he didn't know any guy could possibly be named Kim. @CNN
No, no, no, no! Remember what @BarackObama said: 'it's just a crazy conspiracy'. Yes, that is sarcasm.
How does one get @BarackObama to follow them?

Yep, and @BarackObama also essentially redefined the meaning of 'Civilians' for his Drone War.
So he complained about @JanetYellenBlog for keeping rates low under @BarackObama and now he complain about @federalreserve for hiking rates appropriately as expected a populist that would say and do anything to get air time poor us!

I remember @BarackObama and the entire world laughing at Trump when he ran for president. Fools will always laugh at you for being different - it means nothing. Obama laughed but guess whose POTUS

@BarackObama Do you purposefully NOT watch Trump on TV? His constant bashing of you is hard to watch. I don't know how you could stand it.
I was talking to my gf about how my mentor takes a million years to answer any of my questions (about my article) and she said: "EVEN BARACK OBAMA WOULD ANSWER YOU FASTER" So, @BarackObama , what's up?

Thank you @BarackObama
Stay out of Africa! Ffs your corrupt crime family destroyed @BarackObama 's America. Leave him alone with Africa...he knows what he's doing and why he's doing it! You...it's for show! Take a seat @FLOTUS
Yessss! If you need people to give advice from experience though, maybe contact @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton .
I have said for the longest time @BarackObama and his henchman are but hurt that @realDonaldTrump made him "release" his "birth certificate "
The only thing that press conference proved was how inherently racist our country is, as a whole, to go from @BarackObama to @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump told so many damn lies during that press conference that I couldn't keep up. I also thought they should have had a counter in the screen corner for how many times he bashed @BarackObama and the women accusing Kavangh. Ugh!!
@BarackObama I know your a rspectful person but when the current WH tenant accuses you of almost going to war with NK it might be time to say something. Tired if him using you and your admin. to inflate his own importance. We need a real President !
@BarackObama Sir when I say we MISS U, it brings me to tears sometimes how much U R Truly MISSED. This is a Very Sad Day with this guy. Lord Help Us!!!

I can't believe #Trump said @BarackObama didn't appoint judges because he was lazy. Wtf I'm sure it had nothing to do with the #treasonous Mitch and #Republicans
Well no, we admire George Washington, when you leave office I hope history will erase you like you are trying to erase @BarackObama

@realDonaldTrump answers most questions in under a minute, I have no idea what these people are talking about! You may disagree, but the answers are clear! @BarackObama once took 1 hour to answer 1 question. The question was about Fast and Furious, not the movie!
@realDonaldTrump does not speak for me. I love @JustinTrudeau and I think Canada has never treated USA badly. And also, I know @BarackObama definitely knew what he was doing as President. #DonTheCon is smearing good people.
Trump #2020! @realDonaldTrump keep doing what's right for The majority of Americans. Don't fall cowardly to the 1% that want to be pissed bc @BarackObama liberals policies are being dismantled brilliantly!!
EXTREMELY PAINFUL TO WATCH AND LISTEN TO!!! What the hell is he talking about?? Jeez!! He is clueless. @BarackObama Boy! Do I ever miss you sir. #BarackObama Really missed!!
It didn't work when @BarackObama was president and it won't work now. He acts like he thinks he is better and smarter but only fools himself. No one else.
@BarackObama First 3 successive victories at series as the team.
Why didn't @BarackObama appoint judges? Trump claims you were tired. We know what happened, as do most of the American people. A reminder. @SenateMajLdr blocked your #SCOTUS pick, Merrick Garland & a other Federal judge nominees. @GOP will go the way of the WHIGS. #FINITO #Trump
Did @BarackObama have this problem? Do everyone has this problems? Its because you are a sexual predator and sometimes shit hits the fan.

@BarackObama @HillaryClinton 10:30 tonight
You have to wonder what @BarackObama thinks of @realDonaldTrump calling him "lazy" on appointing federal judges, and disclosing, perhaps breaching his confidence, that Obama told him he came close to nuclear war with North Korea.
@BarackObama You are an anti American P.O.S. I have often wondered how many of us there are who voted for you. That have been awakened like myself who realise we were duped by you. Why cant you just shuddup and retire. Take all the money you stole and just go the hell away!!
. @BarackObama can we please be a fly on the wall at your house?
Maybe when Clinton took the podium from Obama, because Barack, POTUS at the time, didn't have the first damn clue about how to respond? I remember.... @BarackObama
I like the part where he said @BarackObama got too tired to appoint 100s of judges and left the job to him. O.M.G. And the part where it's too expensive to train our troops. We can buy tons of weapons, but he doesn't want to pay to train the troops to use them. Woodward verified.

Dear @BarackObama Please come back. Sincerely. The entire World.
Again a reminder: In the last 4 years of @BarackObama , an average of 213 K jobs/mo were added; in the 1st 18 mo of @realDonaldTrump , 190 K jobs/mo added. Under BO, S&P up average of 30.3/mo; under DT, that average is 30/mo.
Yes UK and Australia provided surveillance of Trump (campaign & admin) through "unofficial" channels by way of the FIVE EYES agreement and info was included in the PRESIDENTS DAILY BRIEFING to @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump
@BarackObama didn't get to pick judges becase @SenateMajLdr McConnell left those vavancies open, and if @HillaryClinton won, they would've stayed open #NotMyPresident

Please save us, @HillaryClinton !! @MichaelAvenatti !! @BarackObama !! Someone. #VOTE

Aww poor, old Democrats, you just can't handle seeing a @POTUS who is successful. #Enjoy being irrelevant for the next 20 years. If @BarackObama didn't SUCK SO BAD, @realDonaldTrump could not have won! #ThankYouBarack you inspired the #WalkAway movement & gave us all 3 chambers
Money is expensive if you pay a lot of interest to borrow it. Otherwise it is cheap and you can print it like @BarackObama did doubling our national debt. Stick to acting with your giant head. #MAGA
@BarackObama and @EricHolder the parasitic marxist duo who trafficked assault weapons to Mexican drug cartels in Operation #FastAndFurious ... where one of the trafficked weapons was later used to kill a border agent. This is your leadership?! #DNCSuicideWatch pic.twitter.com/rp39WHRvcI

@BarackObama Mr. President, Can I just say you are missed every day.. Especially at times like this when we are listening to indiscernible commentary at the press conference today. @StephMillerShow @iamsambee @Thom_Hartmann @CNN @maddow @MSNBC @AP @StephenAtHome @robreiner
HEY YOU DUMB SON OF A BITCH @BarackObama AND MANY OTHER REAL PRESIDENTS WANTED / WANT #2STATESOLUTION OMG YOU MUST GO #pressconference
Hey remember that time @BarackObama wore a Tan Suit and it was a major scandal.
@BarackObama could you put your super hero cape on and save us from the #trumppressconference
Can you imagine if @BarackObama was giving a press conference like this? The GOP would be passing the vote of impeachment already. This asshole @realDonaldTrump needs to go, a dangerous evil narcissist. The cowardice of his party leadership is startling. #TrumpPressConference

#Trump is not going to stop of talking about himself that he is a better than @BarackObama ! He probably will go to jump to 43 former Presidents of United States!! #TrumpPressConference
TYPICAL !!!! We should know this, anyway. George Soros is the Leader for the Liberal/Socialist/Democrats. He is trying his best to finish up what @BarackObama started !! @MaryPena4 @RandyLax1 @seanhannity @rushlimbaugh @DonaldJTrumpJr @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @dbongino
First, you're supporting the position of American imperialism. How has American imperialism treated people of color? Not sure? Ask Venezuelans. Second, WTF does this have to do with Florida? Third, people who associate with dictators? Like @BarackObama & every other President?
@Yamiche just looked like a FOOL trying bait @realDonaldTrump ! I bet it's REALLY hard for her to see a @POTUS who succeeds as opposed to @BarackObama who did NOTHING for America except rack up debt! #PoorYamiche #FakeNews looks STUPID once again! #TrumpPressConference #UNGA #MAGA

AWESOME! #ThankYouTrump for #AmericaFirst #TrumpPressConference something Hussain Obama never did. @BarackObama snubbed over 60 something % of voters & divided the country so bad, ONLY #Trump @realDonaldTrump could bring America Back!
Seems to me that I recall someone that wanted to create jobs rebuilding and upgrading the US's infrastructure...who was it...MY fav Pres, @BarackObama Only 1 of he things he was right about.
Trump is a criminal and not worth anything in comparison to @BarackObama
@BarackObama can you pls be president again
I want to hear how @BarackObama was too tired to appoint judges again
@BarackObama @43georgebush @BillClinton How did we get here?
Yea we know thanks to PRES. @BarackObama
@BarackObama inherited a god awful mess from the W. Bush administration and not once criticized W. @realDonaldTrump inherited a full employment economy from Obama and incessantly attacks Obama. Enough is enough.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, it is time to move on @geogesoros , @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton Send in the generals
I hope @BarackObama & @JohnKerry are having fits around now - they wanted a legacy, they got it. They unleashed regional genocide for the sake of selfies with Rouhani, & Putin leveraged the refugees from that Nakba to bolster fascism globally. And here's Trump.

@BarackObama Maybe bec just getting back from vaca and exhausted and I'm very thick skinned politically but today listening to the demented idiot as our leader doing presser I feel like crying. I feel so bad for our country that this thing is leader. The world watching all lies

#TrumpPressConference Our economy is hot? Yes, unlike our president. Where are you. @BarackObama ??
I miss having a coherent @POTUS @BarackObama #TrumpPressConference
@BarackObama gives one response in this fashion, ONE, and GOP is going for impeachment
He's talking more about Obama than current events. If Obama would make a 3 minute video every week about T.Rump's failings, we'd be rid of T.Rump in a month from a mental breakdown. Please @BarackObama Help us!!!
. @SenateGOP . @GOP . @HouseGOP OMG - Are you listening to this lunatic right now? You still going to stand behind @realDonaldTrump ...holy SMOKES!! WE ARE DOOMED! DOOMED! . @HillaryClinton . @BarackObama WE ARE DOOMED -- STOP THE MADNESS
Say what you want about him but I've always understand everything @BarackObama was saying. So there's yet another thing that he's better than this dipshits at.
(1) "...Prove sexual assault is okay. Good job detective." - reply to @ThomasWictor Sexual assault is okay. This is what we've been reduced to by the likes of @BarackObama , @HillaryClinton and all other Alinskyites who align with @TheDemocrats .
@BarackObama Are you watching this press conference right now? Please SAVE US!!
Is it wrong that I've turned this #PressConference into a drinking game? Say @BarackObama again, @realDonaldTrump so we can take another shot
@BarackObama Mr. President- please respond - point by point -what is being said at this press conference. Please. For the sake of our country. Thank you, sir.
@realDonaldTrump shows a deep inferiority complex as he obsessively compares himself to @BarackObama . Trump will never measure up!
Trump is revealing how very jealous he is of @BarackObama . #cdnpoli
This asshole @realDonaldTrump can't keep my President's name, @BarackObama , out of his lying orange mouth! He is such a sick individual. I can't wait until he's in handcuffs!
Convinced @realDonaldTrump has a huge man crush on @BarackObama . He keeps his name in his mouth
Dude #45 has a SERIOUSSSS hard on for @BarackObama @MSNBC He cannot do a press conference w/o saying his name. Smh
He just lied on POTUS OBAMA and @BarackObama please release a statement denouncing this lie.. sir
@BarackObama was for the ppl of Iran his approval rating was actually good approvals from the ppl of Iran @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @BBCnews @WSJ @nytimes @moveon @TheYoungTurks
@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama did not get complacent in picking judges. The @GOP senate would not permit him to perform his constitutional duty. If they had you would not even have the chance to nominate Cavanaugh.
How many times does this man need to bring up @BarackObama ? #Insecure
@realDonaldTrump 's press conference is unique. Here's a man who is masturbating his own ego in public, while often attacking Real President @BarackObama , talking over female reporters, dismissing victims of sexual assault, lying pathologically & just being his stupid self. Sad.
@BarackObama Mr. President can you clarify what @realDonaldTrump has just said about you thinking we were close to war with North Korea?
Trump has an obsession with trying to discredit one of the finest administrations of this country's history. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama
Hi @BarackObama just wondering if you have a response to anything President Trump said about you today. Thank you in advance for your time.
I really hope that somewhere right now @BarackObama just turned to @MichelleObama and said. "You're running"
Is anyone keeping track of how many times @realDonaldTrump says #Obama @BarackObama ? #livingrentfree
President @BarackObama NEVER let racial antics of the racist Party GrOuP get under his skin. Trump can't handle the pressure he has gotten himself into. Trump is a novice, he was never ready to lead.
How many times has he brought up @BarackObama ? I've lost count. @realDonaldTrump is an insecure man-child
We are never gonna hear the end of comparisons with @BarackObama are we?
@BarackObama Please respond to the lies Trump is telling about you . Yes again!
@BarackObama and @EricHolder will be living it up in GITMO soon, so I wouldn't be using them as fund raisers...
@BarackObama Trumps Economy&Admin is Exposing Ur INEPTITUDE as POTUS & by End of his tenure will make U the WORST POTUS EVER-U were a slick TelePrompTer reading urban Hustling Senator from Crappy Illinois- U benefited from the national Unity Post 9/11 & Poor Rep Pres.opponents
This news conference is Tragic event, please someone call out Trump lies about president @BarackObama dealing with Korea, this #MSNBC coverage is forty minutes of old man rambling; very incoherent press conference!
@BarackObama , @BillClinton , @HillaryClinton , oh how much presumption of innocence offered to them by @TheDemocrats and their trick turning media in the face of well documented & obvious crimes against man and country, yet 36 year old murky claims from unknowns are believed. NO!
@BarackObama @JoeBiden You know what gets tiring? Hearing your Rep talk about how great she is when she won't even state how many times she either tried to repeal or de-fund your healthcare. #Obamacare #millenialssuck
@BarackObama Dear Sir: we need you, we really need you NOW. Dear Gawd....
@POTUS is the most transparent president ever. @BarackObama was a black cloud of transparency. He hide behind words & kept Americans in the dark like his fraud..hide the cash..Iran deal. Barack was a disgusting fool & if he were a @GOP man the fake media would have destroyed him.
@BarackObama WE NEED YOU RIGHT NOW!!!! This guy is NUTS!
Do we have a bat signal for @BarackObama ? Asking for a country...
I #Remember when #America was #Great , and then #OurPresident44 @BarackObama left Office and #realTraitorTrump @realDonaldTrump came into Office and That all Changed!
@BarackObama listening to Dumphs press conference. He is clearly insane. Where are our checks and balances to remove this threat to our safety and democracy? Help us!!
It happened immediately you @BarackObama left office. Let us hear more from you and your support for the Democrats in the mid-terms. Your words are like a soothing lullaby after the frequent and raucous BS we get from the orang[e]-utan.

Well, as we all expected, @MichaelAvenatti has either no soul, or has sold his to Satan, also known as @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama
oh god how i miss @BarackObama <sigh>
@BarackObama Sending the Universe over to say 'Hello'! Meta!
Yes The American President is a real President unlike @BarackObama who made false promises and is a fake. We finally have a real President. And I suggest you craw under a rock while America Wins and you lose.
@BarackObama i'm waiting...
i'm completely baffled that the dems think @barackobama even approaches Trump's level of intelligence
I would ask him about all the golfing he's doing after complaining that @BarackObama was golfing so much...

Keep President @BarackObama 's name out of your mouth, Dotard.

@BarackObama HELP!!! This guess has lost it
So Trump just lies (imagine) & said President Obama told him pre-inauguration that he (Obama) was close 2going 2war with N. Korea. This is bullshit and I wish @BarackObama would call it. Who actually thinks Obama would tell Trump anything remotely like that, even were it true?!
@BarackObama Dear President Obama, WE MISS YOU!
Trump claims President Obama would have gone to war if it wasn't for him becoming president. @BarackObama , #Trump so wishes he was you.
#Trump stated when he spoke with President @BarackObama , President Obama stated that he was close to going to war. But with who? Syria or North Korea. I am lost...
@BarackObama What president trump said today at the news conference about what you said about north Korea, is that true? If so then I do believe you have been given a chance to redeem the true you. We're is your tweet? Did you say it or not?
If your mentor is not letting you grow, give him the finger @BarackObama
Only thing to say watching this joke of a press conference- Oh how I miss @BarackObama #TrumpPressConference
@MichelleObama is a clever lady that will not sit down when a racist ignorant fool like @TomiLahren tells her. @BarackObama was a better president than @realDonaldTrump by every measure. Obama saved the economy and was not laughed at by the UN and the world. #ShutUpTomi

I'm worried about this decision. You have a winning lead and I'm thrilled. I really don't think this is the best idea. Now if we can get @BarackObama to come here, THAT will be awesome.

@LindseyGrahamSC You are such a hypocrite! You and your Senate cronies denied #MerrickGarland a confirmation hearing and due process when @BarackObama nominated him. Not so nice when you're on the receiving end, huh? Your tantrum today was something else. Bravo! #DramaQueen
I thought @BarackObama @POTUS44 said that was impossible?
@seanhannity actually, the BIGGEST smear campaign was of @BarackObama by the birthers and the people claiming he was Muslim. @realDonaldTrump #fuckyouhannity
Watching the #Kavanaugh hearings. Politically #MerrickGarland would've sucked as well. @BarackObama should've picked a progressive judge to avoid cornering Americans into the lesser of 2 evils. Neither political party should be considered heroes for waiting too long on this.
Not anymore. You are now guilty if your politics are not socialist leaning to @TheDemocrats . @BarackObama called it "Fundamental Transormation." Damn #Alinskyites .

@LindseyGrahamSC Respectfully, don't forget about @BarackObama & nominee Merrick Garland. As an American, I would hope both Reps and Dems would put truth & fact finding first & set partisan politics aside re: #SCOTUS decision. #BrettKavanaughHearing

On the contrary, @LindseyGrahamSC is a #hypocrite whose outrage was nowhere to be found when @SenMajLdr McConnell left an unprecedented gap on the #SCOTUS so as to deny @BarackObama his nominee. We see you, @GOP . We see you.
I voted for @BarackObama twice but will be voting a straight @GOP ticket this year because of how much @TheDemocrats have turned me off.
Ye f*** (sorry, mess) around & win 2020 presidency @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama
you mean because he is a p grabber and like you? What about his victim? Any thoughts there? Was it a tactic to delay like when cocaine Mitch delayed the greatest President Barack @BarackObama his choice for over a year? Are you out of your mind? The senate must not vote.
Leakers @JamesComeyFBI @DianeFeinstein #Mccabe @BarackObama @HillaryClinton
He worked for Bush @whitehouse what did you think? His ideology would mirror @BarackObama ? Democrats have proved to voters they are not to be trusted with power in congress. POLITICAL ASSASSINATION FAILED TODAY.
At least you know that @BarackObama gifs are the way to my heart.
@BarackObama You will always be my President.
@BarackObama Mr. President, our country has gone to s**t. Something must be done about this current administration, wow.
@BarackObama Baby Come Back, that is our national SOS song.
A president that is under investigation nominates someone and Senator Graham says it is a "SHAM" when other senators want to cross T's and dot I's? What word would he use to describe what they did to the nominee of the honorable former President @BarackObama ? #worldnewstonight

@BarackObama I had rice and miso soup for breakfast.
@BarackObama @SenSherrodBrown @LindseyGraham You decry a SHAM in Kavanaugh's hearing? Let me remind you the REAL SHAM was when Mitch McConnell and the rest of the crooked Republicans refused to even hold one hearing on Judge Garland's nomination with months left in Obama's term.
dear @LindseyGrahamSC we've watched for nearly 10 long years now as the @GOP --both @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP have obstructed & out right BLOCKED nominees & more under @BarackObama . #Republicans behavior is #Deplorable !
@DanaBashCNN @cnn @LindseyGrahamSC @wolfblitzer *No @LindseyGrahamSC , the most unethical shame in politics history was when your so called best friend John McCain voted no on the @BarackObama care repeal and you voted yes for it. Facts . Thank you

Remember when @BarackObama wore a tan suit? How did we ever survive?
No pearls to clutch @LindseyGrahamSC . Kavanaugh can remember specific dates he drank in high school but you seem to forget last year when you blocked @BarackObama 's appointment #Republicans
Reasons to obstruct Garland's nomination: 1. Chosen by @BarackObama Reasons to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination: 1. Multiple accounts of sexual assault 2. Twisting the truth under oath 3. Blatant partisanship shown in testimony Which instance was disgraceful again?

But it was OK for @MitchPOTUS & the Senate to deny #MerrickGarland a meeting, a hearing, & due process when @BarackObama nominated him. Now with Kavanaugh, it's all the Democrats fault. Nice double standard there @realDonaldTrump . Try #GoldenRule . It stands the test of time.

Hello, I believe some leaders of the countries make the #Wars for selling their #weapons Look at the #MiddleEast ,but when president Trump became the president of the #USA the war in the #MiddleEast is ending and he follows #Peace as he does about #NorthKorea ,but @BarackObama Not
@LindseyGrahamSC I think the bigger unethical sham was the @GOP @SenateGop refusing to hold a hearing for #MerrickGarland the @SCOTUS nominee of @POTUS44 @BarackObama and holding that seat open for more than 400 days, that is a far bigger unethical sham.
#LindseyGrahamCompromised BY SAME #DarkMoney @POTUS @senatemajldr IS. Also.. SO #LindseyGraham , That's how you interview for #JeffSessions Job?? #NeverForget how @BarackObama & #MerrickGarland were treated!
Please respond to the GOP who are quoting your FBI statement during the Anita Hill trial. They only quote Democrats, @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @BillClinton when it benefits them. So, it's up to Dems to push back.
I'm all against petty, miserable obstructionists like the @GOP which for six years blocked everything that @BarackObama tried to work for. I'm also all about getting at the truth. Women need to be heard because for too damn long they were told shut up and do what you're told!
Last, but definitely not least - @BarackObama was just as sharp, warm, wise and brave as you would think of @POTUS44 . Thank you for coming to Finland and sharing valuable insights with us in #NBForum2018 .
Some how the @GOP are still blaming the #Clintons ... Because #Kavanaugh isn't fit for #SCOTUS . Somehow it's the Clintons fault. Thanks a lot @BarackObama .
@LindseyGrahamSC you absolute spineless geriatric shit stain, you were a part of the committee that refused to hear @BarackObama 's pick on a hold put for 2016, and now you refute the same because you're on the hotplate. Well, I hope you fucking burn. Unbelievable.

What a freakin' drama queen. @LindseyGrahamSC , we remember how you and your cohorts denied @BarackObama his right to appoint a justice.

@GOP @SenateGOP GIVE ME A BREAK! You assholes worked for 8 yrs to disrupt, obstruct & stop work against @BarackObama while he was POTUS, and you have the gall to call out Dems for following your playbook- #HYPOCRITES !
We should have had Merrick Garland and there would be no questions. He had a clean history. Oh, yeah, @BarackObama wanted him.
@ThomTillis . Your memory is slipping. Your leader made the comment early in @BarackObama presidency that it would be the goal of Republicans to obstruct him in every way. Oh by the way, #MerrickGarland
Oh. Ok. How can I inquire about @FBI investigation into @BarackObama and @HilaryClinton treasons. Asking for a friend.
@BarackObama had an #IvyLeague pedigree & was constantly questioned, doubt cast on his actual performance, which was stellar. George W. & that Man in the WH had same pedigrees, were deeply flawed human beings in different ways. Pedigree & brains do not guarantee anything.
Watching the #KavanaughConfirmationHearing really makes me angry about the fact that the @SenateGOP blocked @BarackObama from nominating a Supreme Court Justice. Their fake indignation is pathetic. #NoJustice
Post @BarackObama generations have a right to vote their opinion and in the next and current midterm elections does America want corporate greed to influence our courts to reduce what previous presidents created as protected for future generations?
like the one the Republicans refused to acknowledge or vote on - remember @BarackObama Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court on March 16, 2016 - here it is almost 2019 so why can't the republicans delay things for a week

So far, no one has executed an effective coup on the executive branch, as @senatemajldr did with @BarackObama with Garland. No one has abused the constitution as McConnell did. So tune your outrage proportionately.
The most "unethical sham in politics" is when McConnel refused to allow a vote for @BarackObama 's Judicial Nominee (Merrick Garland). The remarks by @LindseyGrahamSC are not only extremely hypocritical, they are painful to hear (apologizing to the alleged offender). Shameful!

@BarackObama you know what to do chief
#funny how #republicans are so concerned with the #time being taken to get #BrettKavanaugh #approved but, for over a year they denied #MerrickGarland a hearing and disrespected and denied @BarackObama his right as #potus #Republicans are #corrupt
Grassley says 60 to 70 days is too long? Merrick Garland.... how long from when @BarackObama announced him and when a vote was taken?
@ChuckGrassley you should be ashamed of yourself. You guys wouldn't let @BarackObama bring his pick, but yet you want to slam through this guy of very questionable character. His defense of himself, shows a man unhinged. @BrettKavanaugh
It would be the sweetest revenge after @TheDemocrats take back the @WhiteHouse and gain majorities in the House and Senate to get @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton on the SCOTUS.
The irony of @SenateGOP lecturing about civility during #KavanaughHearings when they denied @BarackObama his #SCOTUSNomination . THAT was a real disgrace. The standard bearer of their party is a disgrace. The way they subvert the will of American people is a disgrace...
@ChuckGrassley your pathetic grandstanding in regards to how long this process is taking is a sham and a lie! How come you were never concerned with the over one year left in @BarackObama presidency when his choice #MerrickGarland was not even allowed a single hearing? #FRAUD !
#GOP senators talking about irony is ironical, since they didn't allow President @BarackObama 's nominee for the @SCOTUS to move forward. #KavanaghHearings

@LindseyGrahamSC , did you think Mitch @senatemajldr McConnell's treatment of @POTUS44 @BarackObama , blatantly denying any SCOTUS nomination because of his vow to stop anything day 1 was a disgusting or disgraceful act, or was that okay because he's on your team? #LiarsFaceKarma
No, @ChuckGrassley you lying son-of-a-bitch, the worst thing that has happened in the modern history of judicial nominations BAR NONE, is what your party did to @BarackObama and his nominee, @garland_merrick !
@BarackObama you ever try to put yourself back in that seat again, and millions of Americans will cry out for your blood and your hide. We will gladly put you in the ground you traitorous bitch. Semper Fi mother fucker

Didn't watch yet, @SenatorBooker of their poking fun at you but too bad unlike @BarackObama , you're flightless withu big old Germanic ears even though MSM always says he is "black" (like my cousin @michaelaadam and my Dad from his great-grandfather Edward VII) ... pic.twitter.com/GvfBTnBVjH

Great performance by @LindseyGrahamSC . Where was his sense of decency and fair play when he and the @GOP rejected categorically, every improvement, project, law, or appointment, simply because it was introduced by President @BarackObama ? FBI investigation please
Never in a million years would @BarackObama have nominated such a scumbag to the Supreme Court. And I firmly believe if somehow he had, he'd withdraw the nomination. Like a real President would do. #imissmypresident
@LindseyGrahamSC remind me about this Power you speak of. Correct me if I am wrong but was it not you & the rest of your GOP members that would not allow then President @BarackObama to put his candidate for the Supreme Court in 2016? Was it not you & your fellow GOP that would
Along with the @BarackObama Presidential Administration and Hillary Clinton.
@BarackObama your full of shit. But I do got to thank you for VRAP. but your still full of shit. LOL!!!!

@BarackObama hi,dear barrack any update on this names I hope senator/ rep victor .o. Obasogie or opemipo Obasogie. By honorable opemipo.
@BarackObama Lord we miss you!!!! The White House has become a stage with only fools strutting about with sound and fury but signifying nothing!!!!
Super big lies @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC you and your minions have been doing this ish for years... At least 8 to be exact... @BarackObama right?!? #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord
ask your self why @BarackObama are out to working so hard..for midterms? they are afraid of FICA ,dossier ,people talking ,, {LL}? now when do birds sign, DC. in panic #DECLASSNOW
@FoxNews it is an absolute disgrace that @harpfmaria is on with a bunch of seasoned vets. @BarackObama liberal nut
It's very weird that we are examining #Kavanaugh 's high school yearbook and calendar but never saw @BarackObama 's college transcripts.
@BarackObama spent his entire high school years getting High. That was when pot was VER ILLEGAL!
OMG best graphic of the conference hands down: an analysis of @BarackObama 's campaign emails and how many times the subject line was "Hey" - demonstrating authenticity. #NIOSummit2018 pic.twitter.com/eashkdUQZ8
@CoryBooker @SenBooker @KamalaHarris Can you'll please remind them and the American people that the gop told @BarackObama he didn't have the right to nominate anyone for the court
Waiting for the fact checks. I really doubt this it true. And, if it is true, all the thanks goes to @BarackObama . You've done nothing to contribute to it.
This is what happens when people stay home and don't vote. God help our democracy. @BarackObama Kavanaugh hyper partisan mess. #voteblue
It's very weird that we are examining #Kavanaugh 's high school yearbook and calendar but never saw @BarackObama 's college transcripts.
@SenFeinstein @LindseyGrahamSC Graham, you might not have done this to Sotomayor or Kagan, but you did far worse to Merrick Garland and @BarackObama You started the partisan war.
@HarfMaria U repeated A LIE ABT @POTUS separating FAMILY'S U worked 4 @BarackObama Administration THAT separated more children ftheir families than any other PRESIDENT &PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 2 write & executive ORDER 2 STOP separation U &@FoxNews 2 continue 2 LIE W/PHONY outrage
#KavanaughHearings Somebody convince me that @BarackObama asked the FBI to reopen the investigation of @HillaryClinton 9 days before the 2016 election.
@LindseyGrahamSC THANK YOU SIR! #AMERICAFIRST #IStandWithBrettKavanaugh #ConfirmKavanaughNow This is the biggest SCAM against America since @BarackObama was thrown on US! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@BarackObama
Rosenstein meeting delayed. Tick tock... @HillaryClinton @BarackObama
Oh, you mean like you held up @BarackObama 's nomination waiting for the election??? Hey pot, this is the kettle, you're black...
Well besides @BarackObama
@LindseyGrahamSC I liked your act. Seems like you might want to look at the past 8 years. I remember your boy McConnell saying that he would make @BarackObama a one term president. But yeah let's keep the faux outrage up.
Dear Sir: I miss you terribly. If it is at all possible, could you help us elect a fine man named Andrew Gillum to the governorship of Florida? Your endorsement would carry huge weight and we'd be forever grateful! Sincerely, a two time @BarackObama voter and lifetime fan!
#LindseyGraham had a temper tantrum melt down, just like #Kavanaugh because they're losing. @BarackObama didn't cry or pound his fists when Mitch refused to even give a hearing to #MerrickGarland (who BTW is Brett's boss and not a madman.) Stop the insanity, #StopKavanaugh
@BarackObama I know you are crazy busy, but I also know you love hiking. If you are ever passing through Atlanta, I would be honored--to say the least--to take you for a hike and share with you how special our city is.

Hey @LindseyGrahamSC dont you think dems and @BarackObama and Merrick Garland felt just like you do?!? #karma
Interesting how #GOP has decided the #KavanaughHearings are the MOMENT that government went to hell. Not @realDonaldTrump , not when @senatemajldr came out and said his job was to obstruct @BarackObama administration. You created the circus. Unreal.
Really? You were in office when @BarackObama was president right? When he was hung in effigy for his young daughters to see? You were here when @SenMajLdr said he would make sure @BarakObama would not get one bill passed? Amnesia?
Faulted memory @GOP , wouldn't have a hearing for @BarackObama SCOTUS pick keep seat open for over 400 days and you're off the rails because society wants the truth about Kavanaugh. #Hypocrisy
THANKS TO PRESIDENT @BarackObama
#KavanaughHearings of course we've lost all decency just look at the @DNC @Alyssa_Milano W/her face right in the camera at all times, BC of @BarackObama being Hollywood's President, PPL from Hollywood like @Alyssa_Milano think they can make everything a Disgusting Spectacle
@LindseyGrahamSC is a drama queen and a hypocrite. Where was all this self righteous indignation when @BarackObama 's nominee couldn't get a hearing?! To hell with you and the @GOP
. @LindseyGrahamSC you want to talk about a national sham and disgrace? How about we talk about how your party refused to act on a legitimate #SCOTUS nomination, Merrick Garland, brought forth by @BarackObama , left open for 293 days. Duty was ignored for Party. #KavanaughHearings
When will they ask former Sec. @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama ABOUT THE BENGHAZI MURDERS, like this?!!? @realDonaldTrump @KrisParonto
Who loves beer more than #Kavanaugh ? It's @BarackObama https:// buff.ly/2xWhXXd
@LindseyGrahamSC the most despicable thing I've seen in politics I've ever seen was when Scalia's body wasn't even cold Mitch McConnell told @BarackObama he'd not fill that seat. So pardon me if I tell you to shove your #AlternativeFacts and false outrage and shove it up your.
No, Lindsey, that's what Y'ALL did with MERRICK GARLAND'S confirmation at the end of @BarackObama 's term. Own it.
The Dems made no #sexassault accusations against Gorsuch which disproves #Trump 's paranoid conspiracy theories that the Dems will make up any lies to smear nominees just because he's unpopular & @senatemajldr stole a seat on #SCOTUS from @BarackObama
@LindseyGrahamSC When @BarackObama nominated judge Garland... @SenMajLdr blocked it for a fucking year! So go FUCK YOURSELF you trump lapdog!! #KavaNOPE #NoToKavanaugh
I need a beer watching @LindseyGrahamSC peacock and perform at the #KavanaughHearings If this is the most despicable thing he's ever seen in politics, he slept through @BarackObama 's administration and ignorant of American history.
@LindseyGrahamSC saying "these have been my friends" about @SenateDems . Gee, he should review how @SenateGOP treated @BarackObama
Who are you watching? And did you know @BarackObama follows you?!
. @BarackObama said he did COCAINE in high school & we have to sit hear & listen to whether or not #Kavanaugh drank beer in high school? #KavanaughConfirmation #Kavanaughhearings
@HillaryClinton @BarackObama #TheDemocrats any more questions?
@LindseyGrahamSC what you did to @BarackObama was the biggest sham in politics. Your dramatics were a bit much. #liar
I definitely missed @LindseyGrahamSC 's raging, righteous morality when he and the GOP *stole* @BarackObama 's #supremecourt seat in 2016. #brettkavanaugh
Give me a break @LindseyGrahamSC . Where was your outrage when @realDonaldTrump was bragging about grabbing pussys? Where were your morals when your "friends" were obstructing filling a vacant SCOTUS seat so President @BarackObama couldn't nominate. Stop auditioning you fraud.
"If you haven't learn to be a partner with somebody, how to worktogether make compromises have disagreements... If you haven't learn to do that in your primary relationship, it becomes difficult to it with the people you're working with." @BarackObama at #NBForum2018
Only twice in my life have I been ashamed to be American: election of @BarackObama and now the / #SCOTUS hearings. An absolute circus!
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC is called this the biggest, most unethical political sham since he's been a politician... I guess he wasn't a Senator during @BarackObama 's nomination of Merrick Garland.................. The hypocrisy drives me insane. #KavanaughHearings
Graham completely unhinged about a Supreme Court Seat. #MerrickGarland @BarackObama was POTUS for 11 months after Scalia died. You're completely full of it. #SHAM
@LindseyGrahamSC should get an Oscar today. Don't blame the Dems for how DC is, @senatemajldr started the "win at any cost" when he said upon @BarackObama win, that the GOP would never work w/him. But good performance @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC wow!! @realDonaldTrump has taught you well you low down shill. Kavanaugh did EVERYTHING Dr Ford said. You are pathetic!! You can steal @BarackObama pic but cant take the heat when its on YOU!!
. @sengraham2016 clearly doesn't recall . @senatemajldr stating how he would do everything in his power to limit . @BarackObama to a single term & be as obstructionist as possible #KavanaughHearings
can we consult Merrick Garland about unethical shams when it comes to the judicial nomination/hearing process? How about @BarackObama #Kavenaugh
Has Senator #Graham forgotten that time @BarackObama made a #SCOTUS nomination #MerrickGarland #StopKavanaughNow
Remember when the GOP blocked President @BarackObama from nominating a SCJ? #KavanaughHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC was perfectly happy to pledge, upon inauguration of @BarackObama , that the #Republicans would make their EVERY action in direct opposition to anything he proposed. #Hypocrites #ChickensComingHomeToRoost
Maybe, @LindseyGrahamSC , if the @GOP hadn't started the ultra partisan politics practices during the @BarackObama presidency, then the state of politics between Republicans and Democrats wouldn't be in the state it is today. #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC 's feigned anger about a fair process is ridiculous considering that he wouldn't even give @BarackObama 's nominee a hearing because he wanted to (and indeed did) hold the seat open. #Kavanaugh #KavanaughFord #KavanaughConfirmation
Why is @BarackObama not being investigated? All the proof the "left" needs to convict a man of "Sexual Assault" is right here! A woman is accusing him of this, so your "logic" tells us she has to be telling the truth! No time to waste @FBI go catch a rapist and lock him up! pic.twitter.com/z9GWo22plh
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC where was your outrage when YOUR FUCKING PARTY stole the @SCOTUS nominee from @BarackObama ?
@LindseyGrahamSC your pretend indignation isn't impressing anyone. @SenateDems you had better call him on his #MerrickGarland bullshit and how he wouldn't pass one bill of @BarackObama
I feel like Lindsey Graham conveniently forgets that they stole a supreme court seat, and obstructed @BarackObama for 8 years. What a joke this guy is.
. @LindseyGrahamSC This is unreal.... the men who said they would never seat a SCOTUS judge under @HillaryClinton and denied one to @BarackObama are *accusing the Dems* of trying to hold the seat open.
@LindseyGrahamSC you are a disgrace to SC. Ur republican counterparts did the same to @BarackObama and u saw no problem with it then. Now all of u are acting like children. #KavanaughHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC were you aware that you refused to bring a Supreme Court Nominee to a vote under @BarackObama . #StopKavanaugh
Fix it before it's too late, Not even with @BarackObama Stay away from these people & follow your own path. You made here without them so keep it this way, believe it or not this is your time, you don't need them. You just need to believe in yourself. @AndrewGillum
A fair process ? @LindseyGrahamSC how fair were you to @BarackObama choice. Back down. Take your bp meds #gopcircus
@LindseyGrahamSC seems to have forgotten about his position on the Supreme Court when @BarackObama was president. #CrocodileTears
@BarackObama we need you. @MichelleObama leave him to pick up the phone
@LindseyGrahamSC F' you Lindsey, you guys held the #SCOTUS seat open for over 1 year when @BarackObama nominated #MerrickGarland !
Really @LindseyGrahamSC Do you remember the nominee put up by @BarackObama YOU HAVE LOST YOUR MIND??? #KavanaughHearings
@BarackObama You know something about the Constitution: can #SCOTUS refuse to let #Kavanaugh join them? #KavaNO #FordHearing #FordKavanaugh
@HillaryClinton Evil woman..."We came,we saw,he died...That was your words when Gadhafi died.... @BarackObama is a disgrace to Africa..Our leaders are fools..The west will forever bury the African dream.. #RevolutionOneDay

. . . being potentially prosecuted and serving long prison sentences. The maximum punishment should eventually be meted out to @JohnBrennan , #JamesClapper , and @Comey , the principal organizers and leaders of the massive illegal activity, likely ordered by @BarackObama himself.
. . . activity was conducted by perhaps scores of current high-ranking government officials, in coordination with maybe dozens of former employees of the @BarackObama administration, an unprecedented and grossly criminal plot by a group of fellow citizens who were charged . . .
. . . began the day DJT descended his Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy for the @GOP presidential nomination), #DeepState opposition to @realDonaldTrump was hatched in the highest echelons of the @BarackObama administration, especially @TheJusticeDept and @FBI . . .
@FoxNews Remember that time you mocked @BarackObama for his tears after Sandy Hook? What are you going to say about Kavanaugh tears?
Started my day being optimistic, listening to the last episode of #TheWilderness , getting reenergized by @jonfavs & @BarackObama ...to end my day in tears over what Dr. Ford was put through. But tomorrow, I will work even harder to get those assholes outta office.

#Kavanaugh seems irate that there were "10 days" where his credibility was doubted, where allegations were lobbed, where he was the subject of natl. conversation he deemed false. 10 whole days, he cries! Sell that to @HillaryClinton , @BarackObama , & women e-where who live it.

@BarackObama is a fraud
The precedent was set by @senatemajldr McConnell went so far as to make up a bullshit new set rules to screw over @BarackObama - MERRICK GARLAND was 1,000x the candidate Kavanaugh is.
Please imagine...after eight years....not just a couple of weeks...of non-stop attacks on his character...had President @BarackObama flipped out and lost his cool like Kavanaugh did today...EVEN ONE TIME....he would have been crucified. #GOPsetthestandard

Hardship makes you humble, your personal struggle builds your character into the noblest example of itself, whether you are Mister Obama (thanks, @BarackObama , btw.) or, well, *him*.
You realise you're projecting the failings of republicans, right? Also I'd much rather look at @BarackObama instead of the lying, evil, moron, conjob you have in trump, as he, trump, in record time has destroyed america & the world really IS laughing AT america because of trump!
@BarackObama OBAMA WYD FOLLOWING A THORKI SHIPPER
@BarackObama You failed at every turn in foreign policy. You need to shut up and quit trying to undermine President Trump. You had your chance and squandered it. Shame on you.
@BarackObama Today it was said that you are talking bad of America, again. One needs to heed our nation. Support America don't tear it down.
All started under @BarackObama , the community organizer & Divider in Chief. Obama purposely spread hate & division throughout his 8 years & divided this Republic in every way possible. - By race/skin color, gender, religion, class/wealth, occupation, age, party affiliation, etc..

And the GOP is totally invested in cementing a extreme Right wing court majority at any cost to themselves and the Court. GOP was willing to stall the nomination of President @BarackObama for over a year. And unprecedented obstruction. No confirmation hearing or Senate Vote.

President @BarackObama did more for the United States of America in the 8 years he served the country than what fake "president" @realDonaldTrump is doing ... In his first term of office ... Am I the only one who sees this ??? Am I really the only one ??? #MakeAmericaWhatAgain ??
@BarackObama Mr. Linsey Graham evidently doesn't have much confidence in the intelligence of our president is so dumb he can't what is going on (understandably so). There are to many men multiplying the greater numbers favoring the men.

What really interests me is that when President @BarackObama was in office ... He didn't even have let alone a third. Not even an eighth. Not even a sixteenth. Maybe a thirty-third of a fraction in problems that @realDonaldTrump has NOW in office. I'm just saying ...

Reminder: The Republicans have conveniently have forgotten about the shady shit they pulled on @BarackObama and his nominee #MerrickGarland And Kavanaugh is unfit. He lied under oath. All his records have not been released There are credible allegations against him.
@BarackObama Tremble for fear and mouth like a hippo.
Reminder 4 everyone how hypocritical the left is.Mind u the #Kavanaugh accusations are completely false.For those who haven't seen this yet,it's unbelievably awkward! @BarackObama showing off his boner to fem.reporters,then talking #RibsAndPussy In speech
I cannot stand the racist, hateful Mitch McConnell and DESPISE what he did to President @BarackObama and Judge Merrick Garland. #KavanaughVote #MeToo

@BarackObama Judiciary Committee backed Brett Kavanaugh but a full Senate vote was delayed.
@BarackObama You need to profoundly apologize for what you did in Flint - acting like you were drinking that water. Changed my opinion of you drastically. Own up to it if you're really a man. Until you do, you're just another asshole on parade.

@BarackObama maybe President Trump should nominate Hillary Clinton to the Supreme Court then we can finally get an investigation opened on her
@realDonaldTrump u should nominate #MerrickGarland . @BarackObama tried and couldn't get him on the supreme court. Wouldn't it be great to be able to do something he couldn't. You would win. It would also give you thousands of more fans. Let's see if u can get it done.

The SARCASM is directed at @BarackObama 's assertion on the 2016 campaign trail that Trump would cause an economic disaster (I'm paraphrasing, of course). It turns out Obama was wrong; and instead of saying Trump did a good job, he now suggests Trump is riding his coattails?

Here's a thought maybe just maybe if the republicans had not screwed President @BarackObama out of his SCOTUS pick Kavanaugh would not be going thru this & his skeletons would have stayed in the closet. The republicans started this game w/Obama & now Kavanaugh is paying for it.
@BarackObama can you DM me an email address so I can add you on LinkedIn? Thx!!

Kavanaugh already voted in 2017 to reject a 17 yr old in TX from getting an abortion and was overruled by the other 2 judges. He will break up Roe v Wade as quick as he can @BarackObama please talk to Pres Bush about Gamble V US! We need your help, Kavanaugh will make 45 a Putin
Um, @BarackObama has 102 million followers
has, HE IS NOT THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB! @BarackObama Please DON'T keep giving the public your push for Kavanaugh, it is dangerous for not only us women who are victims but the US rule of law.

Go after your own party. This all started with Gingrich's attempts to destroy President @BillClinton followed by many in your party to make, as @senatemajldr McConnell stated, @BarackObama a one-term president. You also successfully destroyed @HillaryClinton with bogus charges.

@BarackObama put sanctions on Russia, and Congress expanded on those sanctions. Trump dragged his feet on actual implementation of those expanded sanctions, and may STILL be holding them up. Please have a clue about what you're discussing before chiming in.

. @BarackObama can't fill a movie theater unless it's a free movie after he is done speaking.
Honestly, so what? This kind of thing goes back years to people saying that Ann Coulter was really a nice person privately. Some trans people questioned me how trans-friendly @barackobama was back when he was POTUS.

Guilty until proven Innocent for the sake of @TheDemocrats political agenda Remember it was @BarackObama who changed votes required to appoint a High Court judge because Dems expected @HillaryClinton to win the election Case against #Kavenaugh seems to have little if any facts
Rereading the Audacity of Hope by @BarackObama . Everyone should have this book in their library. What an amazing story of family, race, and the American Dream.
Oh I understand. If you're white its a racist sign and if your an actual racist like @BarackObama its context.
Once again specifically as a result of @BarackObama energy policy. This trend has been there for the last 10 years.

@BarackObama miss ya B! This asshat in the WH is a friggen disgrace...
At least he m in served in the military. Unlike some jackass that avoided serving 5 X due to bone spurs. I noticed that your bone spurs don't keep you off of the campaign trail, you know the same campaign trail that you criticized @BarackObama for doing a couple of years ago.
I wish life was a Video Game so I could put in a cheat code that would make @BarackObama president for a bounus Term.
Just remember boys and girls, when you hear the Democrats pretending to be moral Puritans over Kavanaughs affection for beer. Their pride and joy @BarackObama bragged about doing hits off of smoke that collected near the roof when the hotboxed weed in a closed vehicle.
@BarackObama be a big person and tell your followers you are a marxist..be proud
@BarackObama You should start a burger place called obamas burgers
Sad where in America the Democrats can chose to target, tear down and destroy anyone who gets in their way. Just ask Republicans who had the IRS target them during the @BarackObama years.
@BarackObama didn't serve either and @realDonaldTrump didn't lie about his service. #SenatorRichardBlumenthal did lie. He disrespected everyone who ever served in combat. #StolenValor

@BarackObama I thought your tenure as President was awesome. Then I watched Fahrenheit 11/9. I'm so disappointed in the follow up to your visit to Flint, Michigan. One day maybe you'll explain why you let MI Governor give GM clean water for their parts but not for the citizens.

Honestly stunned by the Left and MSM going crazy over #BrettKavanaugh 's beer consumption in college while outright celebrating @BarackObama 's cocaine and marijuana use. Honestly, was it because of skin color? Because, if so, that's actually quite racist.

But the GOP has a conniption when President @BarackObama opened a dialogue with Cuba.
@BarackObama I will eat a midnight snack tonight.
Dems name one pres since R. Reagan who helped blacks more than Trump. Even @BarackObama was merely a plantation keeper @realDonaldTrump helped women & blacks more than any of the last 4 Pres. before him. Dems are plantation keepers & blacks suffer. Dems name 1?? @NAACP @GOP @DNC
Thanks @BarackObama

@BarackObama 2 dead, 2 missing and 105 injured.
Hold it right there. I agreed with up till this last tweet. @BarackObama had no choice to bail out the banks and Auto Industry. Economy would have shut down. It was the banks being the Greedy bastards that they were, and you know that.
@realDonaldTrump FYI, @BarackObama would be congratulating the USA women's basketball team for winning gold at the FIBA world games.
@BarackObama Michelle Obama 2020, make it happen pimp.

Last time I saw passion and charisma it was in a man running for the Illinois state Senate. His name was @BarackObama . Here's hoping @BetoORourke ends up exactly where that state senator did. Because that's where he belongs. #VoteBeto
With all this talk of beer, politics and healing a wounded naiton, I wonder if we can create a viral campaign for another beer summit--between @BarackObama and Ye this time tho, if thats what it would take to get a blue cap back on his dome again
God forbid we said anything about @BarackObama spoiled rotten brats
@johncardillo The dumbest national security analysis ( @JulietteKayyem ) ever was just on @cnn . I paraphrase, "Forget about (the billions) @BarackObama gave for the hostages. It is much more valuable to meet with @POTUS (when we pay them money to meet with us)."
@BarackObama has went down as the President who Could Have united this country, but instead, He Divided this country!!
.USA all politicians occasionally traffic in evasiveness-well not the lying Party of COWARDICE HATE the #GOP -but this serial lying "dumb" Criminal RESIDES ON THE HWY Of BLATANT YET EASILY DISPROVABLE LIES. I'll start w/ universally KNOWN TRUTHS. POTUS @BarackObama took office
. @BarackObama 's two Supreme Court choices were women, one a minority. @realDonaldTrump 's two picks have been...you guessed it...white men. This is such a clear example of @TheDemocrats v the @GOP in this country. One party moving forward, the other staunchly against progress.
@HillaryClinton : @BarackObama @BillClinton All of you and so many more are #PureEvil and what you have done!! You dont even deserve Jail. But #JesusChrist will deal with you all //youtu.be/o63E77C3gnA

THANK YOU MR @BarackObama Try taking an economics course largest economy in the world, takes a LONG TIME to change. Debt increased massively, benefit of the tax cut mostly the 1% period. So these are the small government small cost guys yep sure

@BarackObama As much as I like you as a human, your politics were too akind to Chamberlain, which got Hitler, and now America has Trump with Putin a mini Hilter is on the rise.
You're not President Sir @BarackObama . That term applies to one person at a time. You had your chance. Former President yes, President no. Fix that would you.

Because @BarackObama is NOT as insecure as @realDonaldTrump who has the maturity of an 8 year old boy
@BarackObama 41 mm in Minamisoma.
Actually that is also because of @BarackObama , not you. And your fake friend Kanye West doesn't count!
@BarackObama come get your boy. The one you wanted installed as DNC chair.
@BetoORourke I kinda get the same feeling when you speak as I did when @BarackObama spoke. It's comforting to know there are others like him out there. Good luck!
@BarackObama 1 dead and 104 injured.
Hypocrites GOP called President @BarackObama traitor for SAYING he'll TALK with Iran regime leaders, but when women abuser, racist, traitor, dictator wannabe @realDonaldTrump in-love with BFF murderer brutal dictator, MET with him, GOP SILENT "ITS A GOOD THING NOT BAD THING"!
