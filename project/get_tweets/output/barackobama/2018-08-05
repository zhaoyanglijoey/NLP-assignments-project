Oh, by the way Happy Birthday @BarackObama . Apparently yesterday was your birthday. I'm pretty sure that's what it says on these birth certificates. I'm still a bit upset that Hilary lost to you, but I'm almost over it. Maybe it wasn't all of your fault that happened?

Happy birthday President Obama!! Thank you for being the best. @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump is more loyal to America than @BarackObama ever was and @HillaryClinton is a traitor to our country who tried to rig the election. They are the criminals. Quit drinking the Kool-Aid. You need to #WalkAway and educate yourself. Not believe what they tell you too.
I agree 100%. @BarackObama took a racial divide that was narrowimg, amplified it, and then exploited it for political gain with no concern for the damage it would cause to the nation and its communities. There are convicted war criminals that were less malevolent.
Trump will never measure up to President Obama no matter how hard he tries. You can try and erase everything President Obama accompanied but you will never hold a candle to @BarackObama . Never. pic.twitter.com/GshCGXC4bX

@ccn commentators are either idiots or intentionally attempting to deceive the public. Russian interference has been going on long before Trump (so lagitamcy of @BarackObama election sh be in question too). @potus is challenging allegation that he colluded with Russia to win.

Your "accomplishments" are @BarackObama 's. You're literally taking credit for Obama saving the economy that another Republican tanked. WE WILL NOT FORGET! Unemployment has trended downward and the economy upward since Obama took office. GET FUCKED, #45!
Yes...and almonds to sprinkle on top too. #blameobama as he got your coconut and almonds. @BarackObama Please send some of your cake to Jason. Thank you.
