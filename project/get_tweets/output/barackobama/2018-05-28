History is already shaming anyone who supports/ed @BarackObama because he was and will forever be a stain on this great countries history. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA . Why to actors/actresses think they are intellectuals? They are phonies, hence why the"act"
347k for @BarackObama now and rising
Icouldt agree with you more @KristenGBaldwin we all know @realDonaldTrump lacks the class, grace, intelligence and charisma @BarackObama has. And let's not forget the hands, Obama has way bigger hands than DT. #ugh
So @cnn is claiming that because @BarackObama separated illegal immigrant kids from their illegal immigrant parents at the border, @IvankaTrump can't post selfies with her kids
@BarackObama Michelle Obama would be an utterly amazing President. She is eloquent, savvy & full of grace. Trump is a clomping mammoth with extinct ideals. President Michelle Obama would cover the U.S. with pirouetting petals of hope. #Trump #PresidentTrump
Our enemies (fear) laugh at us Our allies (respect) have left us Decades (old) long conflicts are (coming to an end) about to begin thanks to @realdonaldTrump lack of leadership and crooked deal making. @BillClinton @BarackObama both knew this would happen. Trump is a crook
I miss @BarackObama and @MichelleObama both!
On a day intended for remembering the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. You choose to wish people a "Happy Memorial Day" and talk about yourself. Learn a lesson from @BarackObama . He simply thanked our heroes for their sacrifice and dedication.
is there a reason you decided to delete this? is it because this photo was taken while @BarackObama was president and now it doesnt fit the shit on @TRUMP narrative? pic.twitter.com/ejcWrfUQNw
I completely disagree...I dropped @netflix and will never go back bc of the @BarackObama @MichelleObama
I miss 44 the most when 45 reaches new depths of cringe-worthiness. Today, for example @BarackObama .
@BarackObama Fu k off all the way to Libya you greedy rat!
Yes, the World Misses @BarackObama
It was a very sad day when @BarackObama and @MichelleObama flew away on Marine One. You could of done a tad bit more for my brothers and sisters in @StandingRockST and pardoned #LeonardPeltier from the @FBI frame job. FBI, I know you cant tarnish your reputation.
This was who America was under the worst president ever @BarackObama , that is we voted in @realDonaldTrump to Make America Great Again! #MAGA
Because, you silly dote, @BarackObama is LOVED worldwide
@BarackObama bHo is truly disgusting .
This is what a dignified, caring , intelligent president sounds like on Memorial day. Thank u. Miss u terribly @BarackObama
I miss @BarackObama @MichelleObama and their family so much! I miss the grace, character and love you leaded with.
There is a lot of stuff to hate @HillaryClinton @BarackObama and @JoeBiden for why do you choose the one thing based entirely in tin-foil hat level conspiracy? If you seek to destroy your enemies, why not use attacks based in factual, well documented, evidence? pic.twitter.com/F1xIQMHF2g
@realDonaldTrump Obama's @BarackObama spying scandal is starting to look a lot like Watergate https:// nyp.st/2seclWd via @nypost #Obamawascorrupt #ObamaGateSpyScandal #ObamaSpyGate
Is this podcast about @BarackObama keeping kids in cages? Because he did that while you were with him. Sicko.
@BarackObama proxy.
Thank you @BarackObama
For the 65th anniversary of Normandy I got to meet @BarackObama and @MichelleObama it was the last anniversary for most of the great men who fought for age playing a factor thinking of those men n women
Tears. Will we ever see a POTUS we can be proud of again? Or will the idea/honor of the Presidency be so eroded that we never truly recover it? Will my daughters ever experience the hero worship I had for 8yrs of @BarackObama . I hope so. But it's only a glimmer these days.

@BarackObama what have you done lately to unify it behind this @potus ? You didnt do anything to unify it for 8 years, now's your chance for redemption. Stay alert Patriots.
When you're full of shit and realize this photo was taken 2014 UNDER @BarackObama EPIC FAIL pic.twitter.com/HaVQaPIPOs
The American people deserve to have the President that they elected making America Great Again, not effing around with a bullshit investigation launched by @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama . An honest investigation would have those two in prison!
Thank @BarackObama and resign. pic.twitter.com/JjD522J99z
#20yearsoftrump @MSNBC #Hardball now you might not have agree w/everything #Trump was saying years ago but at least he sounded somewhat intelligent, unlike today! perhaps he hit his head or something, why did he create all lies abt where @BarackObama was born? sick
@BarackObama and @HillaryClinton are one in the same...
Shocked by these horrifying stories about families torn apart at the US border? Remember: 1) This has been happening for like a decade now, at least (yes, under @BarackObama ) 2) Racism is the tool of the powerful regardless of party, isn't that right @RISpeaker ? See below pic.twitter.com/Mr3TJD5Voa
For anyone who would like to see the gold standard for tweeting on Memorial Day, please see @BarackObama . If @hughhewitt would like to advise trump to aspire to being presidential, he could refer him to read it also.
Now retweet your original but @BarackObama bc it's still horrible right? #FakeNews #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease pic.twitter.com/QURIzVMb58
America is ready for the IG Report. It better include recommendations for arrests. Lying, Spying, Stealing, and trying to Impeach our President should have Consequences @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @DonaldJTrumpJr pic.twitter.com/EOks4Ug33y
LOL! @yjfischer must be a real light bulb! Thinking that Iran was allowing 'comprehensive verification'! Shows the delusional state of @BarackObama and his bees!
I want @BarackObama to kiss me on the forehead and wish me a good night's sleep, and to wake up from @chrishansen from dateline NBC and for him to have a nice long talk with me.
A good day for the world when @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton and other politicians are hung for treason and whatever other crimes they committed. The pedophiles and cannibals in #Hollywood will be next. @ChelseaClinton your cannibal ass will be going down to, America knows
I miss @BarackObama so badly.
I believe they call it "define the "narrative" lol ... of course, @BarackObama is the KING OF CORRUPTION ... You can keep you plan, Fast Furious, Benghazi, IRS, Spygate ... it goes on and on

Yes, Chuck, there was a spy 4 actually Why didn't the @FBI or @BarackObama inform @realDonaldTrump if they thought Russia might be inside his campaign? Because Obama wanted Hillary to win and spying on Trump was a political game GIMTO TIME

Patting your back. But, did you read what @BarackObama tweeted? Much more solemn and meaningful. You can get there.
Wrong president. Article is from June 2014 dingleberry. Or maybe you've come to your senses and or no longer pro @BarackObama instead you secretly love the #greatestpresidentever @realDonaldTrump . @POTUS
The economy had started growing long before Trump in WH. Isis has not been destroyed & is still massacring people. @BarackObama still does more than Trump to support & help people every day.
You think we could get them to appear on the show? We know they have wjay it takes to br an amazing royal couple- and they can dance! #MoreGalavant @BarackObama @MichelleObama
First of all, thank you United States Military. 2nd @BarackObama for this economy. 3rd thank you @Russia for this reminding us of what needs to be done
All thanks to @BarackObama #GodBlessAmerica
@KamalaHarris @NancyPelosi @BarackObama @RepMaxineWaters
I can truly say I have never missed a President as much as I miss @BarackObama @POTUS44 . He was truly a beacon of hope and a man of honor. Retweet if you miss a TRUE president
The @DNC and the @GOP @TheBushCenter @BillClinton @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @Comey @AmbassadorRice @AGLynch created such a pile of crap it would take a life time to understand it. That's why President @realDonaldTrump is leading from the front to save our Republic.
@BarackObama Disgusting
It was years ago, under @BarackObama - how do you know what Trump was doing?
And I'm in tears. He sent us the loveliest letter when my dad passed. How wonderful to have experienced @BarackObama in my lifetime. An extraordinary Commander in Chief.
During @BarackObama terms, he asked his children be off limits. Today I saw so much hate directed at @realDonaldTrump children for posting family pictures. #stopthehate #peacetrain #nodoublestandards
Just say it ... all roads lead to @BarackObama its all flowing like hot lava in Hawaii pic.twitter.com/cUpzClSxhd

Tonight is one of those nights that I pretend the world is still a tolerable place and @BarackObama is still President. I know, it sounds like a dream; but that used it to be reality.
@yjfischer @BarackObama was a brilliant negotiator, releasing terrorists for a deserter. Pallets of $ for a regime that chants Death to America. #MAGA w/ @realDonaldTrump
Let's make it happen @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @SenWarren @SenSchumer @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJoeKennedy @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG

I miss you @BarackObama !!!! you were such an amazing President and you are such a great person!!
She moved in with @BarackObama last year at that D.C. Hmm?
@BarackObama Wassup yung blood?
It is the voices of our ancestors (like CSK) and our great, brilliant, living leaders (like @BarackObama and @MichelleObama ) that will encourage us as we fight and win in this generation.

How a TRUE American President thanks our nation's most honorable. Thank you @BarackObama perhaps @realDonaldTrump will take notes on grace, dignity and, most of all, class. #WeMissObama
Literally none of that is true. @BarackObama was presidential and didn't bash his predecessor, and the Trump economy is a mess. Try actually researching facts and not just repeating what idiot in Chief tells you.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS45 @BarackObama Trump needs to read and take lessons about proper tweeting from @POTUS44 to our Armed Service on this Memorial Day.
You must understand that @BarackObama is a human being par excellence bar none, & he scares the bejesus out of #MAGAts cuz they know deep down in their heart of hearts that they could never be 1/2 the human he is. So, their only option is to lower the bar. Voila! They give us 45.
Once you are no longer eligible to receive unemployment you fall off unemployed list... @BarackObama said the jobs were not coming back @MichelleObama said we could now get two or more part time jobs to make ends meet! Forced health care no one can afford! Green Energy...
That's what we had with the coward @BarackObama . That why we don't give up our guns, and never will.
You are correct Israel killed and buried them then they grow from the fertile ground of Palestine and now they are in #GreatReturnMarch you must be scared #Soros @BarackObama @HillaryClinton ready to help defeat them before they multiply call for donation
Hope you wake up and realize it isn't President @realDonaldTrump that got us in this mess. Believe me I was fooled too, we all have been betrayed by @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @AGLynch @AmbassadorRice @SenJohnMcCain @JohnKerry @Comey @SenHarryReid @TheBushCenter .
How true ... protect a POS, he tried to ruin our country ... but @realDonaldTrump wasn't having it .... @BarackObama legacy is in the dirt, worst President ever!
@BarackObama you left Americans to die in #Benghazi . We the people have not forgotten!!

@BarackObama you suck you have a lot of nerve to even send this message , you cared less about the Military when you where in office so keep your thoughts to your self no one cares what you say
@BarackObama felt this way, because the MSM never said a single thing against your administration. Your presidency was masked, the general public had no idea what you were actually accomplishing.
@BarackObama Graceful, elegant and spot on. Thank you for your kind words to our fallen and to our veterans and to our current troops.
