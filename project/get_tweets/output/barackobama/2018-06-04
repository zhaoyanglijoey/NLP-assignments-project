I'm old enough to remember when @BarackObama invited Henry Gates jr over for beers to mend a rift. What a wasted opportunity for a wasteful and narcissistic president @realDonaldTrump
Not so, many of us thanked @BarackObama for reviving the economy from 2009-present
Not so great when compared to the 2,922 @BarackObama gave us - you know the guy whose coattails your boss is riding on.
@BarackObama
Actually @BarackObama gave us 2922 days of greatness. Your economy is now riding on his coattails.
I was watching a @DoctorWho_BBCA episode from 2009 where they mentioned and then put @BarackObama in the episode, and I started crying!
Hey @realDonaldTrump lmfao!!!!! @BarackObama #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/QQYxd6ZDVo
@BarackObama Goddamnit, Barry! All this time, and you didn't have to follow the law and you could have pardoned yourself anyway, and you STILL let this shitshow happen. THANKS OBAMA.
@BarackObama : the @Eagles at Obama's house for a BBQ would be the BEST answer to this silly dilemma. Can we make this happen @BarackObama ? Sincerely, DIE Hard Eagles fan Cory
@BarackObama
Im curious, what promise/dream/change did @BarackObama promise, that @realDonaldTrump ruin? @MSNBC @cnn @FoxNews
FYI - proof was released today proving not only was @BarackObama involved in Spying on Trump (months before CarterP) but was directing it.
Can you please list the improvements to Puerto Rico infrastructure during @BarackObama 8 years??? oh... Nada? Infrastructure should have been fixed long ago, it was tragedy waiting to happen. Who did Obama ignore more? Chicago youth or Puerto Rico infrastructure

@BarackObama got any plans tomorrow? Can me and the @Eagles come by and be congratulated by a real man?
Yes it is. Thanks @BarackObama

@JoyAnnReid once @BarackObama said while he was in congress that he was against #SameSexMarriage at the same time you did your Op-Ed and Tweets. Who hasnt't evolved over time? Oh that's right, the #religiousright Do the research. It was @POTUS @Obama44USA signed the it into law.
Funny story. I was gainfully Employed while @BarackObama was #POTUS in fact, I had a 16 year career that ended after the @GOP #taxscam Took effect

Yeah like @BarackObama with Iran. chuck you silly....what rhymes with chuck @zanyantix hmmmm
@HillaryClinton and @BarackObama should host a luncheon for the @Eagles in Independence Park in Philly. #realpatriotism
@BarackObama you free tomorrow?
Seeing @GavinNewsom reminds me 06 and @BarackObama before I went to work for him. #GOTV !
What's a "leak inquiry"? An "investigation" in which it looks like you are investigating but you are just looking like you're investigating. Used by Sir Humphrey Appleby/others. Compare with those of @BillClinton , @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama /others.
WOW! Send him to #Gitmo I wonder how many other #Traitors we got out there roaming free???? ie. @BarackObama @HillaryClinton & their Gang Of Minions!
Nice of @BarackObama to leave the house in order, you should be thanking him.

@BarackObama It would be a nice touch if you invited the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Easgles to your house for a visit. Just sayin' #ObamaInvitePhiladelphiaEagles
Thanks @BarackObama
. @realDonaldTrump Hello Mr. President! It is an honor to speak to you and thank you for the great things you are doing for the American People. Please continue to disassemble the treasonous acts set in place by @BarackObama and his rogue regime of Socialist Sycophants. #MAGA #KAG
I am confused on how everything bad that happens is @realDonaldTrump fault but when things went bad under @BarackObama it was "progress". Now we have nothing more than self entitled snowflakes who will run this country into the ground if we are not careful. Bring back education!
So would you have gone if baby killer @BarackObama was still there? Stand up for something! Christians need your platform!
@BarackObama Kristian Saucier
Cut scene to you @BarackObama . Throw something together to honor the champs like a real President should and would. This is getting ridiculous. Throw a party man!

Freedom of speech you stupid President! @realDonaldTrump Worst POTUS in he history of America. So jealous of the wonderful @BarackObama and so insecure over @NFL excluding you. Sad, little man. And, may I add, totally not smart.
Thanks @BarackObama @POTUS44 You brought us back from the housing crisis, while Trump profited from it
Hey @BarackObama Hey, can you invite the @Eagles to your house instead?
@BarackObama Well guess you think you're funny over 200 shadow offices with over 32,000 people working for you and Iranian Jarret. You think you have a #concrete way #Lol yes #PopeFrancis and yourself code #word #concrete #CheckMate we know. Will #impeach you & then #Treason

Thanks @BarackObama
There was no crime, one was invented to spy on the political opposition. By doing so @BarackObama and #CrookedHillary commited crimes.

#PREACH @BarackObama and @MichelleObama WE MISS YOU *BOTH* SO MUCH
Kudos to this young woman!! Awesome to see she didn't view her baby as some sort of punishment. cc: @BarackObama
My personal opinion: @BarackObama was the best president in my lifetime. Caring, inspirational, inclusive, articulate... I had no party affiliation until the evening of November 8, 2016. Leaders should lead with kindness, hope, inclusion...not hate, racism and fear.
@barackobama @michelleobama RT @tonyposnanski : Barack Obama should invite the Philadelphia Eagles to his house to spend time with a real president.
Word... Also give @BarackObama a shout out & see how A REAL prez greets you
I would say the Benghazi Four were pretty f-ing vulnerable when you and @BarackObama left them to die!
@BarackObama IF YOU & MICHELLE DESTROY NETFLIX, NO ONE WILL FORGIVE YOU EVER! pic.twitter.com/n91rkcJhY9
It would be cool if President @BarackObama honored the Eagles Super Bowl win since Trump disinvited them to the White House.
Huh. Since cover was supplied by the IRS, FBI, CIA, NSA during the @BarackObama admin. Sure.
Lastly, let me just suggest, @BarackObama can you please host the Eagles to celebrate our Super Bowl victory? I'm willing to bet the whole team would show up! #FlyEaglesFly
@BarackObama You should invite the Eagles to your house; let them meet a REAL president! Miss you everyday!
Um @SenSchumer shouldn't that have been the advice that you should have told both @BarackObama and @JohnKerry on the Iran deal??? Just saying!!!!

If I was president, I'd invite @Giants every year f' it lol. The mockery has already been made. @BarackObama should have just invited @ChicagoBears every year.
@BarackObama Please invite the @Eagles to chill with you! They deserve their day with a dignified president.

@realDonaldTrump I don't recall in 8yrs or @BarackObama in the WH that majority of a sports team not wanting to go to the @WhiteHouse cant cancel a visit when people dont want to go, like your rallies. U should just cancel the one for the @NBA while u at it
. @BarackObama should mess with @realDonaldTrump and invite the Philadelphia Eagles to hang out at his place

@realDonaldTrump your OBSESSION with @BarackObama is dangerous. Seek help.
@BarackObama @FBI this post right here
@BarackObama I hear you are trying to take credit for the economy. You started something up, but it flatlined at a point. This good economy has nothing to do with you. All credit has gone to God and Trump! Give credit where deserved. I even did it for you. Trump is UR President
Did you call @BarackObama and thank him ? Don't don't forget to apologize to him for your stupid conspiracy theories.
@BarackObama meet with them
Yo, I really miss you, bro @BarackObama
Thanks @BarackObama !
All this @realDonaldTrump shit going on makes me so glad the @Royals got to visit the @WhiteHouse with a REAL president! @BarackObama #ForeverRoyal #RaisedRoyal
hi ms "frankly i'm offended that you would call @realDonaldTrump a liar" @BarackObama was NOT born in kenya frankly i'm offended at how you're on the american people's payroll yet have such a flippant relationship with basic things like truth, honesty, & using your adult brain pic.twitter.com/UbGI0TB0l9
Actually, many people know @BarackObama was running the entire bogus operation that was started by @JohnBrennan who was the former President of the Deep State. Your father, as you know, was framed for political reasons by a rouge FBI with the help of the NSA, CIA and CNN.
I date a birth defect that I would rather them just fyi Hey @BarackObama ...
Thanks @BarackObama !!
He should search out other people persecuted by @BarackObama and Comey. There are probably enough to qualify for a class action lawsuit.
Thanks to @BarackObama
@tomperez , @BarackObama is on line 1 for you.....
Thanks @BarackObama !!!
Saying that ANYTHING Trump does is OK because @BarackObama or @BillClinton did it is like saying it's ok to take a shit on the dinner table cause someone else used the wrong salad fork!
Thanks to @BarackObama
Haven't got any clips, but take my word for it. @BarackObama is a god at @FortniteGame

@UNHumanRights @BarackObama @foxandfriends @SenateMajLdr Because the 1% makes money out of wars. No one makes money by feeding the poor. Republicans work for the 1%.
Actually this economy is thanks to President @BarackObama but why let facts interfere with yet another lie. Here is GDP growth from 1990 to present. The growth for 2017 is less than 2015 and 2016. 2018 will be worse because of your ham-handed tariff blunders. Worst @POTUS ever. pic.twitter.com/7EVoDBzgx1
So obnoxious of Trump to uninvite the Philadelphia Eagles. Be funny if @BarackObama stepped up and invited @Eagles to come over and hang out.
Fixing the economy was way over your head @BarackObama so you destroyed it instead...there was an answer...you just failed the test!

Seems like it is more you trying to distract from your "legal" problems. Worst POTUS ever just gliding on the coattails of the best POTUS in my lifetime: @BarackObama Nothing fake about the #MuellerInvestigation You are not #KingTrump #TrumpIsNOTAboveTheLaw
It's time those 30 or more people who received the full Presidents Daily Briefing (PDB) from former President @BarackObama be held account. Only the President receives that full PDB and possibly one or two others, NOT 30. @BarackObama is responsible for leaks and unmasking.

We have not seen all the facts yet, so I'm not sure if @BarackObama should spend the rest of his life in federal prison. Let's wait for the facts to come out. But in the meantime, let's keep speculating, discussing and mentioning this every day. That's the #Resist logic.
If #AliceMarieJohnson doesn't hate @BarackObama she'll never get pardoned. That's the only requirement for getting a pardon from @realDonaldTrump . @KimKardashian trump played you
Thanks @BarackObama for fixing the economy because the last @GOP president ruined it. Now the losers in the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump think they can take credit. Only the poorly educated think @realDonaldTrump is responsible for the current economy.
@BarackObama Now you want to say SORRY?
White Jackson Park residents who are suing to block @BarackObama 'presidential' library both a 1st him as president & library exemplifies not only realty segregation of ago but glaringly exposes how little US views Blacks since ask where are state/natl monuments of great Blacks?
Think he would have had an answer if @BarackObama had asserted that he could pardon himself?
Thanks @BarackObama
Thanks @BarackObama for fixing what the last @GOP president did. It's just to bad @realDonaldTrump thinks he has a right to take credit for it. It's also to bad that unemployment is down but greedy CEOs keep the pay low. #GiveAmericansARaise
Ask @BarackObama . He caged them.
@RickSantorum The only way @BarackObama added to racial tension is because racist idiots like YOU didn't like the idea of an African American being president so everything was Obama's fault. You get dumber everyday. SMH
@BarackObama Mr. President, you and Prez. G.B.W, and other true American patriots just might have to ride in and save the republic sir. This goes beyond R and Ds. Its getting out of hand. Come together, use Roosevelt's bully pulpit. It ain't what ex-prez do I know but, it's time.
@realDonaldTrump should have been born an African.Acting like a true African leader. Sincerely @BarackObama was an American President... The later is following on the footsteps of the former Zimbabwe president.
When president @BarackObama left office, he handed trump a growing economy. Stop lying.
@realDonaldTrump ...invitation to the White house to begin discussing plans on how to deal with North Korea. I hope my 10 years experience in constructing pieces of foreign policy for President @BarackObama will come in handy!
Not record setting. @BarackObama had much better numbers and even higher percentage drops than you can ever hope to achieve.
"It was unknowable then, but so much of the progress that would define the 20th century, on both sides of the Atlantic, came down to the battle for a slice of beach only six miles long and two miles wide." @BarackObama #DDAY

I wonder if @BarackObama has seen #Fleabag
First, you have to do something that would need a pardon, for instance like the @BarackObama filthy habit of spying on conservatives. #Justice #QAnon #WeThePeople #WeSeeEverything #Treason #Sedition #NoQuarter
First, we need to know what the conditions were under @BarackObama so we can compare those conditions to the current ones, right?

The CDC said citizens with guns stopped at least 500,000 crimes (and up to 3 million) just in 2013 alone. Seems like more stringent gun laws would allow for more crime. Who's right- @SteveKnight25 who agrees with @BarackObama 's CDC or you and Jess?
I guarantee what trump has been doing with them is far more harmful and relevant. Stop trying to make @BarackObama look bad and stay focused on the reality of our world right now.

@JustinTrudeau This would be good for Canadians also! Canadians shouldn't have to pay $10 for a block of cheese and $4 for a litre of organic milk. @realDonaldTrump the US should end it's own agricultural subsidies that your arch-nemesis @BarackObama helped perpetuate.
Yes, @BarackObama was nothing but a race agitator. The rest of your tweet is invalidated by the first part.
Yeah okay and @BarackObama @AmbassadorRice and @HillaryClinton lied about Benghazi where people died, but that's okay, and Trump dictated a letter and may or may not have lied about it. And NOBODY died. Stoddard is and always will be a a @POTUS hating shill regardless

Thanks @BarackObama !

Their is zero nothing of Barry I value.. nada... His so called legacy was destruction of US & world too as foreign policy... @BarackObama President Trump has access to NSA, CIA, FBI & more and I pray all facts\sins prosecuted to fullest of the law and all the accomplices
Thanks @BarackObama !
Thank you @BarackObama for putting the USA back on firm footing. Just a matter of time when the #GOPTaxScam bill that was funded with deficits will create the next Great Recession. Only the insane will repeat a practice and expect a different income. Supply side doesn't work.

@BarackObama You really hurt this country sir. Today we celebrate 500 days of saying goodbye to Obamas antiAmerican policies!

Thanks again @BarackObama !!
Miss you. Love you. @BarackObama @MichelleObama
Why do people still seem to think that @BarackObama is a Kenyan? Was the birth certificate not enough?
You're doing nothing for this economy trying to take credit for @BarackObama accomplishments! I give my thanks to @BarackObama
And we thank @BarackObama for getting us out of one of the worst economies we've ever had and leaving America in a growing economy that hopefully even you can't screw up. #ThankYouObama #ImpeachTrumpNow
Lmao.....magic wand.... @BarackObama
I think @NancyPelosi should run and @chuckschumer should be her running mate. Yes, and @HillaryClinton could be the Secretary of State. @BarackObama could replace one of the Supreme Court Justices. Michelle could fight for gay rights. The possibilities are endless.

Presidents @BillClinton & @BarackObama both had to recover our economy after a Rep disaster. Both left a thriving & improving economy that Reps took credit for after. Until...they eventually crashed it again. You have used up all of our best recovery strategies to stroke your ego

@BarackObama gave us the economy. You invited Russia.
Thanks to the greatest president ever @BarackObama
Thanks @BarackObama !
Thanks @BarackObama !
Ok, so let's say the economy is setting records. Even if news outlets report it, that's all there is to say. "Economy is doing great" there, happy? Oh by the way, thanks for the gas prices. Gas was cheaper under @BarackObama .... just saying
Thanks to Obama-era policies. Thanks @BarackObama !!
Democrats demands are their ways to sabotage the deal. Their demands are way different than the one they allow @BarackObama 's Iran deal. Americans must wonder what changes their hearts.
Thank you @BarackObama
Thankyou @BarackObama
When you have someone, like @BarackObama , in the office of POTUS who understands what it means to truly be POTUS, then the system works fairly well (despite obstruction from an opposition Congress). But with a corrupt megalomaniac like @realDonaldTrump , it doesn't work at all.
It's pretty sad that both my kids were raised during the @BarackObama era, but will only probably remember Drumpf
WE STAND WITH . @BarackObama very sad you did not. Done with the DNC. DONE!!! pic.twitter.com/eFKnfdvMy1

Imagine if @BarackObama could pardon himself... Only that would cause a problem

Think @BillClinton & @BarackObama ...call this karma.

"I had also internalized a certain ethos: If there was an issue that no one wanted to talk about publicly, I would do it." That's kind of pathetic: by letting @brhodes own this, @BarackObama sadly had already shown weakness that would be exploited by his adversaries.
@BarackObama We did change our leadership we finally got rid of you and the corrupt Obama Administration! #EyesWideOpen11Jun18
Thank you @BarackObama !
John John John John .. if @BarackObama ended the Wars what would he make Netflix documentaries about? Think about it!
LIES. LIES. LIES. Except economy. Thanks @BarackObama !
How full of ignorance and hate are you if you can't hear wisdom because @BarackObama said it?
True! Thanks @BarackObama !!
Thanks @BarackObama
