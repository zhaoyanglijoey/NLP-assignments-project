Not nearly as embarrassing as your party railroading proceedings during the actual #Scotus nomination window under @BarackObama - perhaps you think Americans are really that dumb? We will #rememberinNovember

Honestly, the one decision of @BarackObama 's that has consistently angered me over the years was the termination of the @uscensusbureau 's Statistical Compendia program. No long-term savings to the gov't, but long-term pain for future researchers.
@BarackObama I cannot find the words to express just how much I miss hearing your speeches. We miss you and wish you and your family all the best!

Same people voted for drone murdering, extrajudicial assassination, nation toppling, Saudi dealing, domestic spying @BarackObama TWICE; ...so it actually comes quite naturally to them.
Did you take this same stand when @BarackObama @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems rushed through #ACA ? If Judge Kavanaughs confirmation saves just one unborn baby, it is all worth it.
Yet in death @SenJohnMcCain gets lauded by @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama for having the concerns of Americans at heart when he would've obstructed her presidency at great cost to democracy & human rights. @dccc & @SenSchumer playing #WhytePolitics at cost of voters. #Resist .
