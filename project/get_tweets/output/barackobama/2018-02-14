I will travel the world and decide which country to Settled. All that I want to do right now are raising family. #American are acceptable. Fuck you. @BarackObama
The #Republicans - #GOP in the U.S. Congress REFUSED to work with U.S. President @BarackObama @POTUS44 on Immigration. The #Republicans - #GOP that currently CONTROL the U.S. Congress REFUSE to work with #Democrats in Congress on Immigration. #Republicans are the PROBLEM.
The #valentinesday @Spotify playlist that @MichelleObama made for @BarackObama is honestly pure gold. pic.twitter.com/AyXxTxbMRH
@BarackObama tried tightening the sell of guns while he was in office Now after a mass shooting Y'all wanna talk about #guncontrol
I'm sure you can remember a certain President @BarackObama all but drop to his knees, on more than one occasionpleading for Congress to approve tighter gun controls and laws only to be shut down every time. It probably needs to hit way closer to home for them to be moved to act.
@BarackObama @MichelleObama I believe this is an AMAZING portrait of Michelle and this would make an awesome Valentine's Day gift for her! pic.twitter.com/aa8aYV13TO
@BarackObama Happy Valentines Day to my hero, my President. I miss you and your family, your honor, your integrity. I miss being proud of the resident of the White House. I wish you and your beautiful family love, laughter and happiness. #stillmyPresident
Great @BarackObama and @MichelleObama

Especially, since Putin funds NRA and elects who he wants in GOP--need to end Putin's arsenal @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu
@barackobama wanted to be seen as a great leader, instead he looks like a regular con artist.
@BarackObama I miss you pls come back
I'm a heavy equipment mechanic. Why are you so mad ? Its ok I pay taxes I'm not any welfare so I'm not living off of you. I'm just saying I don't see any change I'm my pay. I don't know or did I vote for @BarackObama so why bring him up? My parents wouldn't let us drop out
@BarackObama INSANITY. The youth are barometers for society. They act out the fears & aggressions of the adults . Adults who are frightened and angry and hateful. The children cannot feel safe when the adults are crazy. Adults who will now b more fearful. Now GUN RECIPROCITY ACT?
We shudder in Australia Bernie! Gun control must be passed to stop the slaughter of your children. #USA shame @realDonaldTrump Thanks for trying @BarackObama after Sandy Hook
I wonder if @BarackObama has figured out his legacy is one of illegal surveillance, malfeseance, and a failed attempt at socialism.
or he had a "dream" to spread Islam through mass murder...all while doing his part to #Resist . that description applies to @BarackObama , @HillaryClinton , and everyone who identifies as #Resistance
The Putin connections re NRA should be staggering @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @Comey @PreetBharara @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJoeKennedy

@realDonaldTrump how is one gonna address violence when all you did was promote violence during your campaigns and most of your presidency so far. Practice what you preach dude. @BarackObama thank you for what you did wish we could have you back!
Earlier this year Trump removed a safeguard put in place by @BarackObama that made it harder for the emotionally ill to get their hands on assault rifles. If you want to argue the "mental health" defense and support this President then you've already lost.
Your right @DaShanneStokes He should apologize..But I think we've seen enough of Trump now to know that he won't apologize and it will somehow be @BarackObama fault. #parkland shooting #ParklandStrong #GunControlNow

@POTUS @FLOTUS SPACE X and elon musk have stolen another one of my ideas . . . Satellite internet. I have come up with previously an e-skinned metrodome internet (amongst other things e.g medical) placed over every city in the world. @BillGates @BillClinton @BarackObama

When @BarackObama was president i received valentines gifts, just saying
@Barackobama May 16, 1998
You have reached the moral abyss. Fully support 2nd amendment rights,legally own guns but NO private citizen needs assault weapons. @BarackObama in 2013 was defeated simply because he was a Democrat &GOP loyalty was with NRA. You are morally complicit and have blood on your hand
I think @BarackObama tried the #hobbylobbychallenge . . pic.twitter.com/E2p528gmX8
What happened to having a President stand in front of a microphone & cameras to express his sorrow & condolences to the families like @BarackObama did each time? Now the dotard tweets!!!!!!! Not acceptable!!!
#HappyValentinesDay , @BarackObama !
No, no, no @Bumbelinabee if you really want to trigger them you have to say @BarackObama has a lot of followers
300 Million guns licenced in America and they wonder why they got issues, and then there's the guns on the street. @BarackObama had the right idea with new gun laws. Hope to God them kids pull through
So the paintings of @BarackObama and @MichelleObama are pretty much http:// Fiverr.com products.

@BarackObama just how corrupt was your Administration? I know you are a certified liar,but that is a punk thing I guess. How dare you lie to the American People on the interview you had on T.V. You better repent to Lord Jesus and ask for forgiveness. Not to Allah

@BarackObama and @MichelleObama always on Top May God bless you
@Barackobama May 19, 1998
This is not a 2nd amendment issue. No one outside of military and law enforcement need assault weapons. You, the GOP and the NRA are complicit in these massacres. @BarackObama was not supported in 2013 for control simply for political reasons.
Distraction from the TRUTH @BarackObama weaponized the federal government to intimidate Americans and spy on @realDonaldTrump
@BarackObama be my valentine
God, I miss President @BarackObama during these times. A leader we can look to, trust, & believe in. Knowing he'd do what he can to make changes. Despite @SpeakerRyan @SteveScalise #mitchmcconell @ChuckGrassley @joniernst @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
Let me guess and I hope I'm wrong. But was this program created by the @BarackObama administration by any chance.
I remember vividly the day after @BarackObama was elected, and a school teacher friend of mine related how a student came to class, full of glee and vigor. "I can be president!" he said when he walked in the door.
Distraction from the TRUTH @BarackObama weaponized the federal government to intimidate Americans and spy on @realDonaldTrump
I want/ need @MichelleObama and @BarackObama to write a book about how they maintain such a loving, passionate, and healthy relationship through it all
@BarackObama was a man and a leader. Every day @realDonaldTrump proves how far he falls short of that measure.
You and your GOP cronies are complicit and all have blood on your hands. In 2013 the GOP defeated gun legislation just because @BarackObama supported it. All your disgusting criticisms of Obama yet you caused this massacre
@BarackObama #DonnieDearest I do not believe the talk that your GOP ('n every Republican Senator & Representative IS yours) opposes reasonable background checks/other measures, is because these mass shootings is their only acceptable birth-control measure. I don't believe it.
I was told by @JoyAnnReid , @Acosta , @maddow , @wolfblitzer , @jaketapper , @BarackObama , @HillaryClinton and @cnni that the blood is on the hands of the #NRA , so . . .
AMEN. You are ALL DIVINELY PROTECTED-never forget it-when we PRAY TOGETHER to "THE GOD OF TRUTH" NO weapon can prosper or be formed against US-DONT LET GO-EVER~BRE @barackobama @michelleobama @realDonaldTrump @jaysekulow @flotus @god @BatWomanBree @IvankaTrump @ccoalition @potus
@BarackObama I know how deeply @sandyhook affected you. Please read this thread and speak out now! We must stop letting the @NRA & @GOP dictate the terms by which we discuss #GunViolence in America. #TakeBackControlOfTheConversation @MMFlint @GabbyGiffords @brianstelter
But we knw who the people wan to speak @BarackObama
"They never knew the use of a good thing until they've lost it... that's the time they feel it" @BarackObama
@BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @clairecmc @SenSanders @SenGillibrand @SenFeinstein @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan The blood of these children, and all those others killed by assault weapons used in school shootings, is on ALL OF YOUR HANDS. You are ALL cowards. Stand up to the lobby.
I will never forget #myPresident @BarackObama and his statement after Sandy Hook. He was courageous and heartbroken. I miss having a real leader with real compassion in the White House. And from @realDonaldTrump ? Crickets
He'll blame it on Democrats & @BarackObama like everything else.
Happy Valentines Day @BarackObama plz come back we all miss you
President @BarackObama is a real American! @realDonaldTrump ? The jury is still out.
THIS should go more viral than anything @BarackObama & @TheEllenShow at the Oscars. You know what to do, tweeps. And consider promoting your tweet. Make that investment in the futures of your kids & grandkids. @MomsDemand #BrowardShooting #Parkland
@QueerEye Barrack Obama @BarackObama nominated by Joe Biden @JoeBiden for a visit from the five guys. #MakeItHappen
@BarackObama was great Prez
The reports indicate at least 16 are dead from today's school shooting in Florida, and I bet @seanhannity will find some way to blame @BarackObama .
I'm old enough to remember when, in times of tragedy, the president would show moral leadership and speak to the nation. @BarackObama had to do that too many times after acts of senseless gun violence. @realDonaldTrump fails to lead, yet again. pic.twitter.com/JQYlgMZcgJ

Happy valentine's @BarackObama
I mostly feels bad knowing that trumpu replace Mr @BarackObama .wise nation have stupid leader
I know he is thinking about being with a man named Michelle and his dream came true. @BarackObama @MichelleObama
Yes @BarackObama tried for 8 years Republicans refused it is time to make it not only for commonsense gun control -better mental health care-bullying has to be stopped- words matter- kindness saves lives
Hate to tell you this will not harm @realDonaldTrump even if it's all true. So he cheated on his wife this will get him what punishment. I know @CNN would say impeachment lol have fun dreaming as @realDonaldTrump wipes @BarackObama fake legacy away.
@BarackObama Undoubtedly you are the most romantic man as of now on face of earth
@BarackObama portrait makes him look like the freak he is, #Spermhead , alien hands, bet there's a tail in there somewhere too. #OBAMINATION
Despicable, lying, POS @BarackObama https:// youtu.be/sr0Tee0YA4s
Yeah, I saw the stuff about the semen as well. While I agree that @BarackObama is a criminal asshole, and has probably taken a few loads on the face, I think people are reading way too much into it. They're letting emotions control what they see...kinda like liberals, really.
@mitchellreports @MSNBC @ap @MichelleObama @BarackObama PLEASE PLEASE please Step Up! &make a public statement for Our , fo parents of school! We need a moral voice. Moms: Need you! Screw the Pres Norms of staying . Actually- That would Be Best Thing To PissHim off
@BarackObama your portrait says it all. You were hiding in the bushes all along undercutting the USA and its people. Your portrait artist prior work of black women holding severed white women head apparently your twined; "as the artist says" statement from your hiding place
Especially @BarackObama !
You had the president and both houses of Congress for 2 years under @BarackObama why no action on guns and immigration? Would rather have issue to campaign on?
Hide and watch.
