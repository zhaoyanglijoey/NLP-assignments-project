To solve golf issue I propose a celebrity match between @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TigerWoods @JordanSpieth to help #HurricaneMaria victims.
You just canNOT be rattled. It's really an amazing gift. You, @BarackObama and @CoryBooker heap coals of nice on their heads. Bless their hearts.
I feel bad that @BarackObama had to engage with #HumptyTrumpty in any way. My skin actually crawls for Barry. Come to #RoyalWedding , Baz!
Thanks @NYCMayor and @BarackObama

@tylerlukew Please wake up! @realDonaldTrump is our President whether you agree with him or not. I happen to think he already is the BEST we have ever had and @BarackObama was the worst ever, but I did not wish for harm to come to Barack and still wanted him to be successful
@HillaryClinton and @BarackObama need to get in a plane together and leave the country so peace can be restored because of your antifa idiots. Take the rapist with you too! Take that #PurpleRevolution and stick it because it will fail. #soros puppets! pic.twitter.com/mPBrqtHheg
Well, I had just twitted the same news. Italy is in a deep shit with these gentlemen hanging around the country. @realDonaldTrump has solid idea on the issue. @BarackObama is a war criminal, billionaire as all of them and has frauded your dreams.

Hey @BretBaier - does this suck-up from @bpolitics ACTUALLY believe @BarackObama can be an ambassador of good will towards the protestors in #Iran ? Is he high or just a #Democrat ? (oops, sorry - that's one in the same). Viva @realDonaldTrump
thank you @realDonaldTrump . you are a gift from the skies after that back-stabber @BarackObama who betrayed us in 2009

@BarackObama on Jun16,2009 CNBC/ @nytimes video abt Iran you mention hope freedom and blahblahblah then ask yourself "Am I optimistic that will happen?" A simple "yes" or "no" question. You answer "I take a wait and see approach" You waited, we see what's happening.
Every time @realDonaldTrump bashes @BarackObama , it makes me wonder how insecure he really is.
Yes!! Even though @MittRomney embodies our political norms, he believes that "corporations are people." There are lots of reasons why he lost to @BarackObama , and I think 47% of voters will remember them, too
Thanks @BarackObama

The payments to Pakistan are reimbursements due to the invasion of Afghanistan that ultimately ended with the death of Bin Laden under the @BarackObama presidency. You know, being tough after 9/11 and all that. Paying debts is a foreign concept to you isn't it?

Yes a man @BarackObama he was not for the American People, he took our doctors, our businesses, our money & claims it just was going to be like this. He sent you our $, why? He told people who were illegal, #Lawbreakers , to vote, word has it he tried to oust a duly voted @POTUS .
Went to visit Buddhist monks last night and they gushed for five minutes about @BarackObama and his visit to Vietnam. When asked about @realDonaldTrump , all they said was: "We wish him the best."
@BarackObama Happy New Year, Mr. President. We miss you.
@NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @BarackObama @DNC Thanks for this piece of crap insurance, Obama care. I just lost my insurance,i have a broken back, and torn muscles in each knee. U all are a damn joke. U have all ruined this country. ALL politiaians are lying POSs

@BarackObama I thought you would put citizen before president.
Attacking @HillaryClinton or @BarackObama , is a distraction by Trump ... He needs scapegoats , to keep you chasing after phantoms , while the norms that bind , are dismantled. Stay WOKE
You used phony non existent sources when you claimed that @BarackObama was not American. You called Fox& Friends daily to complain..the whole world knows about it.
@BarackObama who is he again???
We saw what that looked like during the @BarackObama years
Especially the public office part. @SallyQYates being #POTUS 46 and the first female POTUS would be the best thing to happen to this country since @BarackObama ! Please, please, please @SallyQYates , make it happen!!! Do it for the country! Do it for the world!
#FakeNews #MuellerInvestigation must be getting hot. When all else fails spread @HillaryClinton , @BarackObama and #Democrat #TrumpLies and tweet distractions.

I was anxious yesterday, but then I had a dream in which @BarackObama hugged me and said "when walking on the path of life, you may fall on rocks and it may hurt ; but if you keep walking you'll find a peaceful river that will wash away your bruises. Never give up, keep walking."
@BarackObama launched project Cassandra 2008 letting Hezbollah traffic cocaine into US to broker nuclear deal with Iran. All we got was a bad deal. We got crime and Iran got $$$. @realDonaldTrump works better deals
It is bullshit. Probably a scam. It even sees Obummer as a bot. "Botometer often categorizes "organizational accounts", like @BarackObama , as bot accounts" pic.twitter.com/64FPxcYDGh

Oh you mean by @realDonaldTrump not paying them like @BarackObama did??
I just read what President @BarackObama favorite books of 2017 were. I believe, if he has time to finish it, @realDonaldTrump favorite would have been One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.

Do you mean a secret meeting in a secret restaurant at a secret time...Oh,wait! That's been done already. @BarackObama served their racist asses on a sliver platter 24/7. Eight years of scandal free service to the people who voted for him.
Amen @BarackObama sold our American citizens souls
YOU have done nothing for DACA, you want to use human life as bargaining chips to build a useless & expensive wall that nobody except your crazy 32% base wants (AND we can t even afford) Maybe @BarackObama wasn't a solution but AT LEAST he did something & had compassion
@BarackObama bonsoir
Yeah cuz when @brhodes and @HillelNeuer had @BarackObama do nothing it really helped?!
We have to get @BarackObama past @justinbieber and @katyperry for most Twitter followers. This seems doable. And it will drive Trump insane.

Nope. Can't imagine that. @BarackObama is way too classy, decent, presidential, human for that.

Except for @BarackObama and the entire Democratic Party. I think they lost sight of the fact that their party name is formed from the word DEMOCRACY. They should be called the HIPPOCRACY Party. The world is watching.
Pundits keep talking about the #Irandeal as if it was anything other than @BarackObama giving the theocratic fascist regime nukes. Indonesia, where Obama spent time as a child is a sunni Muslim nation. But its capital Jakarta, has many shia areas. Think about that...
The Mullahs "laughed when @BarackObama "asked" Iran to return our drone"
Any Dems going for Orrin Hatch position if he retires this year? @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @BarackObama THAT WOULD BE POWER
@BarackObama Obama should have been a comedian because his policies were too hilarious but politically suicidal- he apologized to Iran and called American hating Ayatolllah our friend and ally.
' @BarackObama literally founded ISIS'. I love this lie, it's so laughable.

Donald Trump has done more for this country and never once apologized for us as the liberal hypocrite @BarackObama did. I believe when @realDonaldTrump tells us he is a Christian. Only a hypocrite would question ones faith. Obama was a member of a racist church and no one cared.
Personally I try to keep an open mind on all of @BarackObama 's many accomplishments as President. Ive listed all I could think of here on this notepad. pic.twitter.com/EbRcPsMEGu
@BarackObama Understands what this idiot @realDonaldTrump and the ignorant media doesn't: The worse thing for Iranian rebels is to have the open support of the US, particularly Trump! The average Iranian will side with the regime over the US and Trump!

@BernieSanders @hilaryclinton23 @BarackObama - please can you do something about your president. He is fast starting a huge war. It is vital that all politicians form an alliance to get this man out of office.
So, @BarackObama does get credit right?
@BarackObama .... You own this mess...
When @BarackObama was president republicans got obsessed with Golf, now that @realDonaldTrump is president its the dems. Its always fun to watch both sides explain why it was different when the other guy was golfing.
The Americans and the world watching you unstable, clear and present danger! Birther in-chief keep attacking PRESIDENT @BarackObama you're obsess with him and with @HillaryClinton ! The money released to Iranian brutal regime belong to Iranians!
@BarackObama plz come back we don't mind, honestly
Our so righteous @GOP , that hounded @BarackObama for everything, are stone silent for one of their own. Says volumes about how corrupt they've become. This Man is destroying our democracy and no one is stopping him.

Apr & Sep 2016 - You 100% supported @BarackObama sending $1.7 BILLION cash to Iran leadership. You mask your words well. Iran Leaders got this money to support their corrupt system which YOU SUPPORT. You are 2-faced.

If we ever get our country back I want to believe that history books will tell the truth.The story of how @BarackObama fooled half the country, criminalized the @FBI @CIA and MSM (such as @CNN @MSNBC @CBS ) was no longer credible.Great article, exposes Obama as the traitor he is.
Happy New Year to MY President & First Lady!! Missing @BarackObama & @MichelleObama more and more with each passing day of the 'current occupant' at 1600. Reminded every day of Cher's song "If I Could Turn Back Time" ... I'd turn it back to Jan. 2009 and continue from there!
Was @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton wrong for taking him out??? And is that you're only reason for cutting off a valuable source of intelligence?
Today the weather reminded me of President Obama's first inauguration. It was so cold, but there were sooooo many of us filled with love & hope & joy, that we toughed it out. I don't know how we survived it tbh, but I would do it again!! #GoodMemories @BarackObama We Miss you!
The same could be said about Chicago and Illinois but your buddies @BarackObama @davidaxelrod @RahmEmanuel have been part of the problem. Do you have enough courage stand with the people of Illinois?

Dear ppl who actually see who Trump is and what he's about, but still support him, There will be riots, protests, and investigations until that sick man is gone from office. Like or dislike @BarackObama political leanings, at least he was a man of class and character. -11/6/2018
@BarackObama would rather spend time bashing @realDonaldTrump and creating social discord.
Well at least his not bragging about being the Messiah who can walk on water like his predecessor, @BarackObama , the most incompetent president in our History : @realDonaldTrump is getting things done and wait for what he accomplishes in 2018
@AmbassadorRice @BarackObama @HillaryClinton You built this!!!!
...the pettiness that some of us have in our community helped allow @realDonaldTrump to win. Ex: people didn't vote for @HillaryClinton b/c they were STILL MAD at how she "did" @BarackObama . They forgot that Trump treated Obama worse AND that Obama STILL endorsed Hillary.
