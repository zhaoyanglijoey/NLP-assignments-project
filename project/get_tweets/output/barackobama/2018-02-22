@BarackObama @HillaryClinton @EricHolder you can keep your Gun Free signs at your cribs. After we get rid of them in our schools, the criminals need a place that says they'll be welcome with open arms #2A

Thank you, @BarackObama , no truer words have been spoken; I just hope your words don't fall upon deaf ears and the young people of our country don't become disillusioned and/or discouraged in their fight.

@BarackObama Holds Some Responsibility for the Parkland Massacre. He helped Desensitize America, making many thinking it was Okay to Burn Cities and Kill Cops. Right Barack? They were acting stupidly. @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @MSNBC @nypost @nytimes @CNN pic.twitter.com/qaOpb2mRQD
I actually received a very kind rejection e-mail from @BarackObama . He's really busy. I get it.

Obama did it #nuketheweb @BarackObama
I just googled @BarackObama childhood pics and I would highly recommend
Nothing on her? It is/was your butt buddy @BarackObama 's people in the Justice and FBI who failed us by not prosecuting. Anyone with half a brain who listened, saw and read the evidence, and could read the relevant law, recognizes and understands that. Ask your States AG.
@BarackObama Professional question for you sir. Where were you during you're 8 years in office when school shootings took place? You did not offer solutions or urge students to march in protest. Why are you now doing this? You are undermining our Legality Elected POTUS.

@BarackObama I recently saw the picture of you sitting in the #SandyHook classroom. You are #MyPresident . Thank you 4 standing behind #gunreform . We need to get #NRA out of politics now. Teachers need to teach our most vunerable & precious commodity, not be the militia.
How about that nice payment as a bribe that pays for dead pple? @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu @RepJoeKennedy @SenBooker
now that @MichelleObama and @BarackObama not in the white house, i would sell everything i own to see them on @WildNOut
@GeorgeHWBush @BarackObama @TheBushCenter Dear Mr. Presidents, is there something you still can do to stop this? Maybe talk to some senators? I mean, this little kids are living in a real hell. Please do something. Humankind will thank you, gentlemen.
@BarackObama please come back into office and make this country right and how it used to be. we miss and need you
@BarackObama
@BarackObama you have already screwed up America enough stay out of it
This thought just made my day: once @realDonaldTrump is no longer Prez, nobody will ask his opinion about anything anymore like we do now with @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama . He will be forgotten. It must scare the living sh*t out of him.
BS - OBAMA DID NOTHING - SIMPLY INTERVIEW HIS RELATIVES IN THE USA AND AFRICA - OBAMA DID NOTHING BUT DIVIDE US, THE WORLD AND STUFF HIS POCKETS @CNN @FoxNews @BarackObama

@BarackObama your our best president
Hey @realDonaldTrump , here's a challenge for you... @BarackObama couldn't bring about gun control laws during his time as president. Innocent kids were killed by guns in his time as president too. Imagine being able to actually say that you did something better and mean it?
@BarackObama and gun control #NotMyPresident pic.twitter.com/kBdNamdfRX
Do you mean when @BarackObama took action asking both houses if Congress for specific actions to ban assault weapons, background checks, and keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally Ill? Not so much "listening" as taking action.

I just want to know when you will be in jail. Stop tweeting you are so corrupt no one wants to hear from you. Go to another country and ruin it. @BarackObama @universal9494
@BarackObama when are you coming home the babysitter is weird #NotMyPresident #wewantobamaback
@BarackObama you had 8 yrs to have these kids backs and protect them. "We have been waiting for you" is creepy & wrong. They are kids who you should have been protecting while you wherein office so this did not happen, after u left. Stupid men make stupid comments....
@BarackObama was reasonable on gun control, not partisan I don't think obama ever called for a assault weapons ban in legislation he certaily supported it but as for of what he thought congress could pass @CNN @NRA @gop @msnbc @foxnews @WSJ @nytimes @washingtonpost
