Uh if you want to point fingers, that starts with the most corrupt divisive ex President we had @BarackObama
Tonight I will be watching all of President @BarackObama 's past State of The Union addresses while @realDonaldTrump reads lies* via teleprompter. *See Stephen "Lil' Nazi" Miller #IMissObama #MuellerIsComing pic.twitter.com/Bnm2oRnpQX
Also, @POTUS has 22M followers and @realDonaldTrump 47.2M followers. Even combined, that is fewer followers than @BarackObama has. So, Donald Trump's tweets are less valid than Barack Obama's tweets by your logic. Huzzah!

DACA is illegal, you know it. @BarackObama knew it and stated it. Sorry, if their time is up, under illegal DACA, then they have to go. Up to legislators to fix immigration laws and come up with legal solution to current status of those still covered by illegal DACA.

I don't remember any congressman disrupting @BarackObama 's state of the union addresses. I do remember one rightfully calling him out for his lies about health care. You know, like our premiums would come down $2500 a month and we'd be able to keep our doctors.

If it weren't for the @BarackObama economy @realDonaldTrump would have been impeached and jailed by now. That's the state of our union.
Yep. Thought the same thing. Especially after the abuse the @HouseGOP tried to inflict on @BarackObama during his final #StateOfTheUnion (but he absolutely owned them, anyway)
Can't get enough of this beautiful couple @BarackObama @MichelleObama
Tonight, let us remember that people like @RBReich and @OccupyDemocrats are still claiming this is magically @BarackObama 's economy, thus admitting the failure of his economic policy. Looks ok for freshman year president, not a 2 term outgoing president pic.twitter.com/McYAB7JoJl

The only thought I have with regard to #SOTU is this: @BarackObama has been the greatest president of my lifetime.

Let's all remember re #SOTU : the gains we've seen over the past year are a result of the @BarackObama administration. @realDonaldTrump should say #ThanksObama for giving a curtain to hide behind.

@SenSchumer (American traitor). Giving the FISA engineer @BarackObama the credit for the successful @POTUS acts and leadership. Chunky continues to lose democrats!
@BarackObama I know you're "happy to be out of the WH, enjoy life.... Best Regards, from Chicago !!!!
Dare you cite one .. just one .. policy put in place by @BarackObama that grew the American economy #SchmuckSchumer

Imagine if 5 white male reps, 4 white female reps, & 1 female and 2 male reps of color boycotted @BarackObama SOTU... Just imagine the wailing, gnashing of teeth and deafening roars of "racists" from the MSM. @Lawrence @donlemon @HardballChris @JoeNBC @maddow @wolfblitzer
Because you blocked them from being filled when @BarackObama was president.
Funny how none of the companies bringing jobs back to the USA aren't thanking @BarackObama . they're thanking our true patriot @realDonaldTrump .
@BarackObama Waiting to hear one positive word from you about our President Trump. Nothing but criticism and crickets. A bigger man than you would give credit where credit is due

In @BarackObama last quarter GDP was 1.5%. Sure, this economy is due to @BarackObama . LMAO.
Keep telling yourself that as the legacy of @BarackObama and #LorettaLynch go down in flames as the most corrupt administration in American history.
@BarackObama buy healthcare or get penalized....this fucking communist did that to AMERICA and no one stopped him!!!!
@Clyburn Under @BarackObama the most racist administration in history we were under a dictator egomaniac who clearly corrupted the FBI/DOJ/IRS & you have the stupidity to make a statement comparing our great president @realDonaldTrump to Germany;go back to school idiot;losers lol
I saw & felt exact same in 2012 between @BarackObama & @MittRomney . #liberals lying, cheating & oppressing the other side was final straw made me leave @TheDemocrats . Truthfully I felt so sorry for #Republicans plight that I joined them to fight back against my own EVIL party!
. @mitchalbomshow - @wjrradio 's national "news" (LOL) feed @CNN reports @HeidiHeitkamp wants increased infrastructure spending. She should go after retrieving the $800+ BILLION shovel-ready boondoggle of @BarackObama . It was STOLEN for a slush find for @TheDemocrats .
Este Internet de #InfinitumPeorServicioDeMexico no lo tiene ni @BarackObama en 2018 lo vamos a vender :v
All of which is due to the excellent job @BarackObama did during his 8 years in office. Just because you say things over & over again does NOT make it true!
@SenSchumer aka #SchumerShutdown @BarackObama put more people on welfare. Remember Obamacare, #TheBigLie ? He followed #SaulAlinsky 's doctrine, #KeepPeoplePoor pic.twitter.com/M22R291syp
The majority of his base have no investments; it would mess up the rest of us with investments, after @BarackObama worked so hard to get us back on the right financial track.
@SenSchumer your so wrong the economy from @BarackObama is tanking and he said we lost manufacturing jobs.

@HillaryClinton what do we do as Americans who believe in Freedom of the Press and the institutions of the FBI and DOJ? It feels hopeless. I think many of us would like your guidance. You and @BarackObama Please.
@BarackObama was disrespected because of his skin color and in no way only chose to be president to just his base. We are at a constitutional crisis at this point and we don't need permission to treat this treasonous president as a traitor.. We shall not be watching
FINALLY! A #StateOfTheUnion that actually MATTERS. @BarackObama
OMG what I'd give to watch just one more #SOTU by @BarackObama , my forever president....... #SOTUBLACKOUT
Ive got a phone and a pen. And Trump has an eraser and your text and emails. Who's got the law now @BarackObama ???? Ha Last laugh #ReleaseTheMemo pic.twitter.com/QWp9Ro5Jc4

Maybe @AndreaTantaros is lying about @FoxNews she constantly lied about @POTUS44 @BarackObama on air to the American Ppls face. I mean when someone lies to your face could you trust or believe anything that comes out their mouth
Senator Schumer got this right. We won't hear him say thanks @BarackObama . pic.twitter.com/PVN0cXm1uh
Proved @BarackObama is CONSTITUTIONALLY INELIGIBLE 2 EVER B POTUS. Ch. 39. Article II, Section 1, Clause 5. Minor v Happersett (1874) 88 U.S. 162. Didn't need sealed records 2 prove that. Obama's own admission! Every "official act?" Void ab initio! pic.twitter.com/nEFkc0d7HV
Lets see some action and back up what you say, we had enough of all talk with @BarackObama !
For years #Democrats ignored the #BlackUnemployment numbers. Now that @realDonaldTrump has lowered it, they want to give the incompetent @BarackObama credit. #LMAO
Been saving the first episode of @Letterman 's "My Next Guest..." With @BarackObama , and today just seems like the perfect day to dive in. #SOTU
. @BarackObama yes? we.....?
You're a bum just like your father. My President is still @BarackObama
People say time is supposed to get faster as you age. I see no evidence to support this, feels like it's been a thousand years since @realDonaldTrump got inaugurated but @BarackObama felt like eight, despite Trump having been in office for only an eighth of Obama's time so far.

Big mistake there, WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU MEANT @BARACKOBAMA the shithole
@BarackObama Can you give us a word on how to survive the disentagration of our country. Thank you
Not that I'm not thrilled to be followed by @BarackObama , but I started following him before he was president and I think they autofollowed everyone then. But I am a total #44 geek. Have you read @AlyssaMastro44 book? Loved it.

Still getting his instructions from @BarackObama that's why
I know just how you guys feel. I had to make it through 8 years of @BarackObama . It was incredibly painful but I survived. You can too!
I've never watched until @BarackObama became president because I was interested in what he had to say
@MarkWarner has lost touch with reality to think the Mueller investigation is on the level. Fake Dossier. Obama was a wiretapper. The Democratic platform stands for division and inclusion of Illegals and wealthy Hollywood. To Jail with @BarackObama and the FBI & DOJ too! #MAGA pic.twitter.com/o2VfIXSoWL
@BarackObama ain't shit
What has a better chance of happening, a @sternshow reference or a good word about @BarackObama by our #Potus at #SOTU ?
"When you give up on yourself, you give up on your country." @BarackObama
It's possible that one day someone will come along who will make #BlackChildren feel the way @BarackObama did, though I'm not sure it's possible. But I do believe that one day his grace, strength, vision & care he brought to the office of President will be fully appreciated.
YAY! So great to geek out over Blair and Q and the pups. They are sustaining my soul in these uncertain times. I just noticed something. Of your 24 followers, one of them is @BarackObama ? You are my new hero.
@RepMattGaetz You are spot on! #ReleaseTheMemo next will be the 5 missing months of texts, any Law Enforcement agent has access to these, #ReleaseTheTexts and stop the bias, #WeThePeopleDemandJustice unless @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton cartel are above Citizens of #USA , @FBI ?
@BarackObama Follow me
@BarackObama Hey Barry! Any idea where all these ramped-up Taliban attacks are coming from? http:// goo.gl/djqLdU https:// goo.gl/57hHnj Ohhhh... I wonder where Iran got that extra money? https:// goo.gl/Zamccs Oooohhhhh. Hrmm. Good work there.
The primary person responsible for a race relations crisis in this country is absolutely @BarackObama , for whom the CBC hid a unquestioned racist photo over a decade. By now spewing your ignorant ridiculousness, you too show your racist transparency.

I just went to see my Dr. I wouldn't get a flu shot. Seems the establishment wants you to get a flu shot. Thank you to our former #Dictator @BarackObama and his #ObamaCare . You really screwed us dude.
@CNN well we all KNOW that EVERYTHING that came out of @BarackObama was a down right LIE!! He sugar coated EVERYTHING! #worstPOTUSEver
Not sure how #Hollywood elitists, Libs/Dems continue to try & mislead people into thinking that @BarackObama is some how responsible for the power surge of the US economy...people see right through these #FakeNews storylines as seen in this poll #shameful
I wonder how many times @realDonaldTrump will mention @BarackObama name tonight smh

Remember when @RepJoeWilson yelled "you lie!" at @BarackObama during at #SOTU address? I wonder what he'll blurt out at President Pinocchio ( @realDonaldTrump ) tonight! Can't wait. Also, Wilson's real name is Addison Graves Wilson Sr., but voters connect with Joes, I guess.
hmm.. @RepAdamSchiff @SenFeinstein @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @EricHolder @Comey .. seems like @FBI verified the House Intel FISA abuse memo #FakeDossier #WitchHunt to take down our President that the electorate voted in, Nunes caught it #LOSERS Nice try @Hillaryclinton @Barackobama
45's not fit to walk in 44's shoes. Most 's know this. No one can possibly deny the utter hypocrisy that's playing out in real time. @BarackObama wouldn't have made it past 5 kids 3 mothers. Read my pinned tweet. I miss him so much. pic.twitter.com/FlQ28waqxg
It has nothing to do with "the forgotten man and woman" whom Trump could give two shits about. And that is bearing out in his shitty policies that will continue to negatively affect them. Luckily, @BarackObama left Trump with a killer economy that even Trump can't derail.
Yep same here. Don't want to hear his B.S. lies! No time for a Racist, Biggot, That only thinks of $ as a flipping so called president! @BarackObama You Still Rock!!! @realDonaldTrump You are nothing but pure horseshi%!!!! @HillaryClinton Chin up, You Rock too!! @TheDemocrats
You met with renowned anti-Semite @LouisFarrakhan together with @BarackObama and you covered it up.
i dont recall anyone boycotting President @BarackObama
@SenBooker sez releasing the memo is treasonous, but can't splain how, or why, because explaining isn't in his DNA - much like @BarackObama . Booker's in the phase where he looks for - and accepts - adulation, readily and w/o humility. "What works for Obama's gotta work for me."
@BarackObama all you needed to do to save your legacy was to charge Trump with a crime BEFORE the election...you failed.
True. Although I think It's all gonna come out in the memo that MI6 spied on @realDonaldTrump because they were asked to by @BarackObama and CIA! That's treason from Obama and interfering in another countries election from UK! Can't cover up forever!?!
(Sigh) Just spent the past hour or so watching videos on YouTube of @BarackObama ; him w/ kids, w/ Joe, w/ @MichelleObama and their kids, just being coolest, classiest Prez ever. Was feeling nostalgic, peeps; those were the good ole days.

@Franklin_Graham & @JerryFalwelJr are #ImpostorEvangelicals , #Hypocrites and Racist for their unwavering support of @realDonaldTrump , who doesn't darken the doors of the church, while insinuating that church going, Bible quoting, spirituals-singing @BarackObama was a Muslim.

Jorge M, how is forcing to buy insurance (which any/every one of us may need in un-affordable quantities at any time) a bad thing? Kudos to @BarackObama for a Conservative system (when our side wants Universal). Or should we give people HealthcareOptOut ID's, to die in street.
Our Shadow President still at work! Why the hell does he still have security clearance? When most Ex presidents retire and enjoy life, @BarackObama still is the obstructionist he's always been! He hates this country and he hates the people! Hezbollah is calling you!
@BarackObama I just saw a documentary on your speeches. Thank you for sharing your wisdom, the world needs people like you and @MichelleObama . Wish you were still in the White House. Lots of love for you and your family
