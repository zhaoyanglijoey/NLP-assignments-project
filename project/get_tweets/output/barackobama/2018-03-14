No Cold Steel Rod shoved up your rectum by @BarackObama ? Then buy a house & get a mortgage under @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 's Booming Economy! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #KeepAmericaGreat
Keep Your Eyes on the Prize. Your historic movement is working and WE THE PEOPLE stand with you.. You understood the Zeitgeist and like @BarackObama said, "we have been waiting for you".
@BarackObama has us in the elite 8!
@WeLoveObama4 Love this account! @BarackObama was a great president and @BernieSanders will carry that legacy forward in 2020.
@jeffsessions should use his leverage over McCabe to get him to talk on every corrupt event that occurred during the obama term. If McCabe wants his pension bad enough he needs to serve the @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton on a silver platter #FireMcCabe
Another @BarackObama legend. If it was anything that would poison the water Barry had his hand on it!
It's always a good day when you realize @BarackObama actually follows you. What great support for the Troops and veterans. Let's see if @JustinTrudeau will do the same.
@BarackObama Do you love me
Ive got nearly the same Final 4 and the same Final 2 as @BarackObama . Might be time to change up the bracket then

Smoother shot? Sounds like a challenge @BarackObama
No different than what the republicans did to @BarackObama 's Supreme Court pick, so zip it! Looks like your candidate had a #Stormy night in Pennsylvania.
@OFA When you ran the @BarackObama account in 2008one of your staffers blocked me, and I pretty much worship BO AND voted for him twice. How can you fix it? I'm STILL blocked. Never knew why.
This is the type of presidential prediction I like talking about. @BarackObama , making @michiganstateu #1 is gutsy, but I like it!!! pic.twitter.com/mUmTeGwpGw
@BarackObama i have too study this
@RonBurkle I don't have all of those pics from us partying at your place in LA with @BarackObama Send the rest over when can. pic.twitter.com/YZOYoU8MUn
@BarackObama Susumu Nishibe.
@BarackObama Sumire Negishi.
@BarackObama thank you for being you
Thanks @BarackObama and @ChicagosMayor !!!
President Obama's 2018 NCAA Basketball Championship Brackets - Obama Foundation http:// nie.mn/2HA7XGe via @BarackObama
What an awesome human being! Thank you, #stephen hawking! RIP~ and thank you @BarackObama !
Her Indian audience looked bored stiff...some applause but overall unimpressed. She's got to trot off to India playing shadow President along with that other dog, Obama. Get the hell out of the way @HillaryClinton @BarackObama
@BarackObama If you are going to be in Chicago on during June 10-13, we would be honored to meet you and Michelle for coffee and conversation. A group of our credit union board will be in town for a conference, and would LOVE to chat with you, if your schedule permits. Thank you!
jw, @BarackObama you ever watch Scandal? Is that what the white house is like? - Asking for a friend
Trying to fill out my #MarchMadness bracket for my pool...usually I put MSU in the center and work my way backwards. But I see that @BarackObama has the Spartans winning it all this year and statistically President Obama is not great at putting together a winning bracket.
Funny how @BarackObama and Democrats ignored Russian interference UNTIL @realDonaldTrump was elected...
I think @BarackObama just got challenged on both counts LOL
Loving the brackets from @BarackObama and @Comey with @UNC_Basketball in the final four!
Sounds like you should have a friendly wager with @BarackObama on the bracket, no?
Man I miss having a first family that I could look up to and admire. Once again, thank you @BarackObama and @MichelleObama . You did this country proud, and we thank you for your service.
4 grtness You nid d wisdom of @realdonaldtrump @vp @barackobama @billclinton @billgate @hazzabinzayed @kingsalman @kingabdullahII @pontifex @emmanuelmacron @tkpresident @ooniadimulaife @profosinbajo @bukolasaraki @ike_ekweremadu @yakubdogara @benmurraybruce @rafiuibrahim
Former President @BarackObama picked @UConnWBB to win it all...I may have to disagree Mr. Obama, @HailStateWBK is my pick! Who do you have winning it all for the women?
@BarackObama where do you drop in fortnite
@BarackObama I miss seeing you on the news, sir. I'm also so very grateful for what you, Biden, and the rest of your cabinet did for our country during your term. Bless you!
. @PeteSouza discussing the time President @BarackObama coached his daughter's basketball team at @SidwellFriends . #GettingToThePoint
We him to put @UofA threw further! But I love @BarackObama
I have a theory on why these kids are so good at public speaking: They grew up watching President @BarackObama . Not only his gravitas, poise, and stage presence, but also his eloquence and depth. #NationalStudentWalkout
Now is the time for @MichelleObama or @BarackObama to speak up. It's now or never.
My president @BarackObama has always shown love to UNC basketball. #HeelsNation #DefendingChamps
@BarackObama just saw your bracket. @michiganstateu all the way? Izzo is 1-11 against Coach K. BTW, we reeeeeeealy miss you.
@BarackObama know he wanna be a Spartan...
Hokies to the Elite Eight @BarackObama !
However, like @BarackObama you picked against St. Bonas. WRONG!
Yet @BarackObama encouraged it during the last election. But the @DNC and #Democrats turn a blind eye to that interference
You are a beautiful human being, @BarackObama .
We sure do miss you @BarackObama your special way of connecting with ppl of all ages, abilities, talents...
@BarackObama You are one man when in the room I'd shut up. @realDonaldTrump I'd go out of my way to shout you down.
It sure does seem so. My question is, why?? Was he promised Director of FBI if @HillaryClinton won? Did @BarackObama promise him something? I can only imagine how complicated this investigation is. We know one thing else for sure, there are many involved. #LockThemUp

I will never understand people voting to reelect @BarackObama Now @GovRauner is being challenged by @JeanneIves I threw out my vote rather than vote for @MarkKirk because he supported @PPFA , #IvesforIllinois
Yeah Trump did that when you couldn't! However, you are responsible for giving North Korea nuclear power. Obama couldn't do this either. Instead, Obama gave nuclear capability to Iran. Bother of you fools instead tried to destroy this country. @BillClinton @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/7Qaguv0kRX

HELLO! I seem to recall... a U.S. president by the name of @barackobama ... imposed sanctions... expelled Russians, and took away property... UGH! It's the current occupant of the WH that won't do jack shit!
I'm guessing you can post up on @BarackObama as well
Hey, @BarackObama In the end, that's what this tournament is about. Do we participate in a sport of cynicism or a sport of hope? (apologies to @jonfavs )

Definitely, but the swamp critters like #SchumckySchumer @SenSchumer , #OlBigEars @barackobama , #Broomstick1 @hillaryclinton , #BatshitcrazyNancy @NancyPelosi , #BilltheRapist @BILLCLINTON , or #CrazyEmptyHat @repmaxinewaters won't like it
What was the best day of President @BarackObama 's presidency? @PeteSouza says it was when the Affordable Care Act passed. #GettingToThePoint
All's I can say is that at least you don't have #MSU going all the way like @BarackObama ! #GoBlue
I shouldn't laugh but this family isn't really known for upholding the vows of marriage. The Obamas on the other hand.... @MichelleObama @BarackObama
@BarackObama has MSU going all the way pic.twitter.com/wkIE6HMfgv
Do I crib @BarackObama bracket or @Comey ? #MarchMadness Decisions, decisions
