@BarackObama Happy President's Day...my president for life!
Happy Presidents Day to a fantastic person @BarackObama
For some reason, happened to look @BarackObama 's Twitter page just now. It said there were 166 followers I know. Just found that so interesting.
Just a lil Happy Presidents Day shoutout to my fav prez and stud muffin @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/8aLayTMoz9
It really burns . @realDonaldTrump that . @BarackObama has *without trying* the ONE thing he really wants but can't buy or extort: respect. The only person to ever love ickle DonDon was his immigrant mother. There, there, Donnikins #Bitty . @GOP
It's wheels up for former President @BarackObama after a long weekend in the #CoachellaValley . He just departed from @AirportPSP #PalmSprings (Wearing a black ballcap) pic.twitter.com/MwBEh9Lz6m
@realDonaldTrump do you remember that time @BarackObama expelled 35 #Russia #spies and seized their compound then you wanted to give them back to #Putin ? ...yeah, fun times, fun times. Stop lying and be a #man you loser!
@BarackObama happy birthday to the BEST president ever
@BarackObama warned you. (like you didn't know). The entire intelligence community warned you. (like you didn't know) You lied about it and protected Putin. #TrumpColluded #EnemyoftheState #LiarInChief
@BarackObama love the pictures. can you come back? we miss you. life was good. happy pictures
It would b interesting 2 know how many HPD tweets he got vs @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton who is the true President & should be put in office the minute #Trump #Resigns or gets picked up/Under these conditions new laws should b made 2 amend d wrong doing by foreign Gov.&domestic
Happy Presidents' Day @BarackObama please come back we miss you so much
An evening with @PeteSouza44 at the Henry Ford Museum. @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/jMwp2D7b1z
@DineshDSouza @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @BlissTabitha The only thing that the Obama passed in 8 years was gas and nothing else
So what you are saying is that it's his fault you chose to break the law and in short get caught and look like a traitor, nice try dummy . And to be clear @BarackObama did do something and even warned you, and in @realDonaldTrump ego, you turned it away and no want to blame him
@BarackObama We miss you SOOOO much!! God bless you & All that you did & tried to do for the country. This current regime is beyond.
@BarackObama Bring your own KY...
The only thing missing today on this #PresidentsDay2018 was a compassionate President. Times like these we need @BarackObama Miss him!
I miss @BarackObama
Not 1 person within his 8yr trm had ANY dealings or PLEAD GUILTY with RUSSIAN ASSC. You did, con man! @BarackObama
just wanted to say a happy presidents day to @barackobama !!
You got me watching a few others too. Crying? Over a missing a President? Indeed. I guess we're lucky we had that. @BarackObama we are still, so in love with you! Happy Presidents Day Sir!
@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @MichelleObama what is your opinion on this?
Happy Presidents' Day to our President @BarackObama !!!!! You the the man!!
@realDonaldTrump has tried to blame @BarackObama for everything. It is time for DT to take responsibility for #TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpCorruption #TrumpColluded #TrumpAffair #MuellerTime #notmypresident #BlueWave2018 #neveragain
Thank you Mr. President!!! @BarackObama We miss you!!!!
OMG, @BarackObama More deflection to try and change the narrative. You should be more concerned with the families that lost loved ones in the Florida MASS KILLINGS on your watch rather than continuing to attack Celebrities and our Intelligence communities in our country.
Or maybe The Donald misses President Obama as much as we do. Maybe President Obama is always on his mind, because maybe President @BarackObama is secretly The Donald's favorite president. Duh #TrumpColluded
Happy Presidents Day @BarackObama
@BarackObama @MichelleObama
Gotta take a moment here. It's President's day I want to personally thank @BarackObama @POTUS44 for being the president of all people. For giving us an example of what is good, what is right in leadership. For showing true emotions in a time of senseless death and human suffering

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has done more in less then a year then your boy @BarackObama did in 8 yrs & covered up his relationship with radical & Terrorist groups. Nothing like giving $ to Iran
Happy Presidents day @BarackObama , hope you're doing well. We miss you.
Celebrate Presidents Day! Say Thanks to @BarackObama !
happy pres day to my G @barackobama #stillmypresident
C) ALLOWED CORRUPT A-HOLE @SenateMajLdr TO COWER HIM IN OTHER WORDS HE ALLOWED HIS "GUT" TO MAKE THE DECISION TO STAND DOWN FROM RUSSIA TROUBLE IS HIS "GUT" GOT US ALL SCREWED @BarackObama

Remember when we had an amazing president? @BarackObama pls pls come back!! Our kids need you!!
@HillaryClinton @BarackObama you will surely die. When you go against Yahudah
Happy Presidents Day... @BarackObama @HillaryClinton
A well established lapse in judgment from the entire @BarackObama administration. With small exceptions, both @TheDemocrats and @GOP are complicit in this lapse. This is one area where @SenJohnMcCain has been correct from the start. The narrative remains: russian collusion.
I guess Trumpers are going to grift until fired/REMOVED @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @Comey @PreetBharara @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @RonWyden @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu
This Russia colussion is smoke and mirrors. The real damage to the American citizens were #FusionGPS memo and @BarackObama administration colussion to stop a legally elected presidential candidate. These are the real crimes committed with much intent and thought.
Happy Presidents' Day to @BarackObama !!
. @BarackObama of course!
Happy Presidents Day @BarackObama @BillClinton #JimmyCarter #GeorgeWBush @GeorgeHWBush Thank you for your Service to Our Great Country!!

#trumpNotMyPresident ..but Happy Presidents Day, @POTUS44 @BarackObama We miss your scandal-free class & your sanity.
And @BarackObama has not been the President since 1/20/17. Why haven't you since then done something about Russian Meddling. Because if you do anything against it, it raises legitimacy concerns of your election. The same reason you refuse to exercise the congressional sanctions
@BarackObama have a great PRESIDENTS day!!!!
Thank you @BarackObama this #PresidentsDay for making our country greater and stronger during your years of honorable, highly moral and dedicated service! #PresidentsDay2018 pic.twitter.com/ItiRJZyDhu
@BarackObama had eight years to do something and sat on his hands. @BarackObama was lazy and this is all his fault, now @realDonaldTrump will have to clean it up and make it right. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump accused the @BarackObama administration of doing nothing about Russian interference in the 2016 election, but former officials say that Trump is the one who has ignored the threat. http:// nyer.cm/tr6O0ki
Who is that?? Happy Presidents Day @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/VJxIaRR5wQ
@realDonaldTrump could learn a little something from the @FBI . As incomprehensible as was their failure, they did not lie about it; they did not blame @HillaryClinton ; they did not blame @BarackObama ; they are not owned by Ruskies. That's T-Rump, and it's so very sad. For us.
With tempers, and temperatures rising, mindcite propose a new kind of American tradition on #PresidentsDay . RT if you agree! #leadbyexample #MAGA #Resistance #dramacracy @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/zsiqZRLedS
Happy Presidents Day to my president @BarackObama
@FLGovScott @POTUS @realDonaldTrump too bad you guys are too scared to attend. A real leader like @BarackObama would have and also would have given thoughtful smart answers. #gunsense
Thanks again President @BarackObama !!
On Prez's Day, we celebrate POTUS' of past & wish our current POTUS success. Today, the White House is empty of any such person & for no honorable reason. Perfect metaphor of reality. Happy President's Day to the last, @BarackObama , & the next real POTUS who will fix this mess!
@BarackObama Happy Presidents Day to one of the best presidents of my lifetime!
It's February 19th, 2008, and @BarackObama has over twice as many Twitter followers as @realDonaldTrump .
HAPPY PRESIDENTS DAY IMY @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/fBUvwx88qR
They loved @BarackObama 's foreign policy where he talked but did nothing. @JohnKerry was the perfect SOS for that role too. pic.twitter.com/QSj28oHot0
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Better and more thorough screening of people wanting to buy #guns is not a solution Mr. President. If such screening would really work to the extend you would like it to, then you Donald J Trump would never have made it to the oval office!!!!
Happy President's Day to MY president forever @BarackObama

Don't blame this on @BarackObama - there was already too much info re: you & your people involved with Russsians to ruin Hill & get Trump elected. You people are so good @passing buck. @realDonaldTrump is not our president. Call it collusion, treason- Enjoy jail .

@BarackObama fired @GenFlynn as Director of DIA...effectively ending his career. AFTER Flynn left DIA he took money from Russia & worked for Turkey...and @realDonaldTrump chose him as his National Security Advisor. But, when in doubt, blame Obama or @HillaryClinton , right?
"Happy Presidents" Day @BarackObama Thank you Mr. President.
"The 1980's are calling, they want their kitchenware back." - @BarackObama (probably)
Happy President's Day @BarackObama . Thank you for 8 years of leadership, and social responsibility. Thank you for the hope you brought to us, and the dignity. Thank you for the honor you brought to the White House and our country.

Just wanted to take a moment today to celebrate and say thank you to @BarackObama . I can't wait until we elect another president. #PresidentsDay2018 pic.twitter.com/FYFnxdOiVY
So sad @BarackObama had to leave office. Respected around the world. You came for beloved National Treasure @Oprah . You, making enemies everyday. #Parkland teens coming for you. No #PresidentsDay greetings for you.
@BarackObama only paused in the middle of a round to acknowledge the beheading of Daniel Pearl. You were ok with that, right.
@BarackObama I just want to say thank you for your service to our country.
I hope @BarackObama had a good day today
Happy Presidents Day to my hero @BarackObama #TheGOAT pic.twitter.com/Cly7M4Xstd
Happy Presidents Day @BarackObama @MichelleObama
@BarackObama - a man of grace, patience, esteem, kindness, intelligence, wit, and courage. One who is, was, and never will be perfect, but who maintained his composure, went high when so many went low, and never uttered an insult back to the many who cast stones in his direction.
attack started under @BarackObama but not a word. @cnn deserves fake news title
@realDonaldTrump has no right to question anything about @BarackObama . He stood up to #Putin face to face. He kicked out agents, seized property. @GOP didNt want #Russian (or #TrumpRussiaCollusion ) reveal close to election. This is nothing more than a smear campaign #Resist
Happy Presidents' Day @BarackObama hope all is well pic.twitter.com/CpZ14OXeDQ
Please, the will never ever measure up to the academic caliber of @BarackObama . The will never ever measure up to the kindness, generosity of spirit, the quality of natural leadership and concern @BarackObama exudes.... I have to stop and cry now ....

@BarackObama thx for being a real one
@realDonaldTrump you've got some social climbing to do. 48M is less than 1/2 the man Obama is reaching 100M followers. Oh. Sry. Forgot, Happy Presidents Day @BarackObama we miss your steady leadership! Tell @MichelleObama to run 2020! Keep it in the family!
At least @realDonaldTrump can say he won today. He made to the BOTTOM of the list of Presidents. @BarackObama was 8th on the list.
It would be so helpful if you had ANY LONG-TERM MEMORY - @BarackObama TOOK ACTION against Russia, so very different from your boy who is kissing their butts and fearful of offending his owners! You should be ASHAMED but the sad reality is you have NO CONSCIENCE
Including his Muslim middle name to make sure EVERYONE connects @BarackObama w/Islam...even though he is & always has been Christian...echoes alt-right sentiments. Also, @GenFlynn is one of many w/Russia connections. Obama didn't make anyone do anything. They betrayed America!

I just realized that anyone under the age of 30, has really only known 1 POTUS. They caught the last part of #Bush , not pretty. Then grew up politically with @BarackObama . Their schools, the media, & their communities, have taught them #Obama is the 2nd coming of Jes*s.

Republicans didn't go along with anything he wanted to do in 8 years, what makes you think they would have gone along with a Russia/Trump investigation started by @BarackObama ?
He did, it was just covert. He made no public announcements because he did not want it to appear as an attempt to sway the election. He knew what keeping quiet would do, but he held his tongue out of respect for the election process. @BarackObama was and is a gentleman. #25th45

@POTUS has been vindicated in #RussiaProbe . Time to end it and open an investigation into @BarackObama & @RepAdamSchiff @DNC for their collusion with #Russia
Please ask #MitchMcConnell ! @BarackObama wanted to go public with info. But #TraitorTurtle refused. 2. @BarackObama immediately closed down the Russian compound, expelled Russians working there & imposed sanctions. What the F are YOU doing ! Where are the #RussianSanctions ?
#SchiffForBrains #FullOfSchiff @AdamSchiffCA you and @BarackObama are guilty as sin of lying #IllegallyUnmaskingAmericans for political purpose Indict Both!

Happy Presidents' Day to Barack Obama and only Barack Obama @BarackObama
I think its cool that @BarackObama has over 100 million followers and drumpf not even half of that. You know that sticks in drumpfs craw. That dude is so envious of a great president and knows he's hated by more than half the country.
