I got to pick @BarackObama for my environmentalist project
@RepMcSally You obviously didn't know Senator McCain. He wouldn't announce his stop to fight against brain cancer because of your politics. In fact he would have disagreed with you but also defended you as he did @BarackObama . Your the one who stopped so low as to use his illness
True! And remember when @BarackObama said, 'those jobs are NOT coming back.' Remember when Obama did the Mike Drop and said @realDonaldTrump will NEVER be @POTUS
@BarackObama 's first two books, "Dreams from My Father" and "The Audacity of Hope", both won Grammy Awards for Best Spoken Word Album as audio books.
The #ObamaRally continues!!! Thank you @BarackObama !!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Been a minute man, can't get a follow back?
@BarackObama Dear Mr Barack Obama, I wish to meet you some day. Your my favorite President of all time. I always loved to listen to your speeches on TV. My friend from the military played basketball with you at base, I wish I was there too.
Bwa ha ha ha ha @GOP . The longes streak of job growth (94 months) was 78 months under @BarackObama and 16 months under @realDonaldTrump - are you seriously trying to take credit for something that Obama started and sustained for 62 months longer than Trump?
Did Trump ask for @BarackObama birth record?
Promises made, promises...oh, wait...Let's just spend 8 years screwing America and calling anyone who calls me on anything a racist...- @BarackObama
Once again, you have vindicated @BarackObama without even realizing it. If the weakest recovery was right after the biggest economic downturn, it stands to reason that the second weakest recover would follow the second biggest economic downturn. As such, you can't blame Obama.
Rewind @TheView 's tape to 2008 to see how the ladies treated a current co-host's late father compared to @BarackObama . #RIPJohnMcCain http:// bit.ly/2BUx3BS
Thank you @BarackObama for that amazing head start you gave to your successor and I mean successor in tongue and cheek
Sometimes I want to cry at how much I miss. @BarackObama
Did you ask him for @BarackObama 's birth certificate? BTW, he's brown and you touched him.
@BarackObama
He is insanely jealous of anybody much beloved. Case in point, his going after anything @BarackObama ever did. His jealousy of these men is small and so very sad.
@BarackObama Weren't you the guy that said 1.7% GDPs were the new normal? And weren't you the guy that said U.S. jobs that went overseas were never coming back? And weren't you the guy that did a mic drop after suggesting Donald wouldn't be president? WORST. PRESIDENT. EVER.
Don't know why you consider TRUMP part of the party of war he intentionally stopped funding @BarackObama 's Syrian freedom fighters AKA Al Queda Muslim brotherhood salafist and ISIS pic.twitter.com/wQY3kHJspb

support @BarackObama because I thought and I still am convinced that he was the right person at the right time. He rebuild everything which Bush took down, @POTUS44 is more loved in Germany then Kennedy. However Im a real conservative, and I see in you what @SenJohnMcCain always
Thanks Kenya is taking Global Shaped Politics thanks @BarackObama for that gift
Thanks in part to @BarackObama unlike you trump walked into a thriving economy and has been riding your coattails ever since! And, unlike you, trump has been part of so many scandals, criminal activities and treasonous behavior, it overshadows his few accomplishments.
Thanks @BarackObama
Atleast Kenyans are recognsiable worldwide A Fact Republicans must adhere to thanks @BarackObama

They've got nothing to brag about, so they're bragging about what @BarackObama did in leaving them with a country in great shape. Something they obstructed at every turn. How did the lose all human shame?
Thank you @BarackObama !!!
Just filled up my car. Why isn't anyone talking about the price of gas? It's nearly doubled. When @BarackObama left office it was less than $2/gal. I wonder how much @realDonaldTrump is making from his Saudi friends for the price spike? Economy's great he says. Not so much. pic.twitter.com/sQbyymRpcE
@BarackObama hey um. I have a question. I know you won't answer, but, would you at least consider that you are more than qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just in case you didn't know: You will NEVER. be the man #McCain was. You will never be the great president that @BarackObama was. YOU WILL NEVER BE A MAN or a real president.
Thanks @BarackObama !! pic.twitter.com/Bb7pG6d2f5
As a strong supporter of @BarackObama in heart of 08 race I will never forget when a lady said Obama is Arabic & McCain quickly said no he's not he's a good-hearted man&u have nothing to fear if he becomes president I think Ill be a better president that's why I'm running #class
@BarackObama would be an excellent choice.
Thanks @BarackObama
When that streak is over & employment goes up & everything is a mess. You'll go back to blaming @BarackObama but it won't work with most voters. Lot's of you will be packing up your offices.
@Barackobama May 11, 1998
Ftr...when I die @realDonaldTrump is also not invited to my funeral and I would also like for @BarackObama to give my eulogy. Thanks.
Who is the "establishment" and we'll see if a "deal" has truly been struck... Wouldn't want it to be another North Korea now would we? Thanks @BarackObama for getting our economy going in the right direction!
It's funny how they skim over @BarackObama 's deceit, attack @McCain and now they are all slobbering over his death.....gimme a damn break! GAG!!!! https:// youtu.be/SVn59TC2QqM
Thanks to @BarackObama
Thanks @BarackObama for the amazing economy!!
80% of that time was under @BarackObama notwithstanding everything @GOP did to make that not possible. People can smell bull!
@BarackObama I'm, excuse me, Mr President ! Can you have your wife Run for president. Please. By the way, we really miss you!
Great Job President Obama @BarackObama we still LOVE and appreciate everything you do and how awesome you are when the current POTUS opens his mouth, tweets or .. or ... or .. plays golf.. sorry he doesn't do much if ya think about it .. so again thank you @BarackObama
I'd like to thank my mysterious amulet for teaching @LiamPayne economics; my life coach for being in my life; and @BarackObama 's grandson, for taking me to the moon.

Our beloved @BarackObama has full confidence in South Africa!
I thk Russian Hoax is that. There is NO evidence that @realDonaldTrump colluded with Putin which is what the investigatn was about. So NO evidence, why continue it? For "statue of limitations " to run in order to protect @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama read & believe facts.
unpatriotic, unmanly and its clear "You want power for the sake of it, strong leaders seek power for the better good" and thats why @BarackObama and George W. @GeorgeHWBush are picked for the ulugies. Although each made mistakes, they were all about country.
@BarackObama may your heart and soul bare truth to the integrity and truth that john McCain gave you in debate and in life...
I'm guessing he didn't chuck a spear at you or try to repatriate @BarackObama ? Please resign.
@GrantWoods @POTUS On CNN you said John McCain couldn't care less about what Trump said about him? Why then did he not want him or his family at his funeral and h asked for @BarackObama and George Bush to provide the eulogies?
She is right. Which is precisely why @realDonaldTrump is so hateful. He KNOWS he cannot measure up. He KNOWS he will never be an equal to the likes of those such as @BarackObama & most certainly not one such as @SenJohnMcCain . #TrumpIsNoHeroNorPatriot #TreasonousTrump

So when @BillClinton @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama pass, are you going to do a full on, in-depth article like this on their own LGBT equality evolution? I somehow doubt that. The man is not even in his grave and your put out this article. You folks have no shame.
@BarackObama 's tribute to John McCain is eloquent, thematic, heartfelt, and coherent speach from a president. How refreshing. #JohnMcCainRIP

Sorry. I voted for John McCain in the 2000 primaries. I write him in during the 2004 general election. I voted for @BarackObama in 2008 when @SenJohnMcCain tried to put that moron @SarahPalinUSA one heartbeat from the nuclear button. Good decision, given his health problems.
Naw...he is too busy fixing what @BarackObama screwed up during his time in office. #TDS is full swing here...wow. Just wow. Please seek help.

@BarackObama Sir, I know you won't reply but I voted for you twice and so respect you. My partner Steve and I have been in our relationship since 1980. We are Michael and Steve and known as MIST. We thank you for all you have done for us.

I hope Trump ask Kenya for @BarackObama 's Real birth certificate!

It must of been like a homecoming of @BarackObama again having the president of Kenya there in the White House with @realDonaldTrump #maga
NO ONE WANTS ANYTHING TO DO WITH @realDonaldTrump AT THE SERVICE! They would rather have a Democrat retired president ( @BarackObama ) there than anything representing the #Trump administration. Let that sink in!

Thanks, @BarackObama , for fixing the awful mess @GOP President Bush left you with. Please remember, you can take credit, @GOP , for less than 20% of this bull market if it is all bc of a president. And, when there is a market correction soon, you can take all the credit - tariffs.

Unfortunately #McCain , after losing his chance to be #POTUS , turned into a bitter, self-centered politician who only seeks personal aggrandizement & gain. You know, like @barackobama & @HillaryClinton . Had the chance to take the high road but instead chose petty politics
John McCain's speech on conceding the 2008 Election to @BarackObama remains one of the best speeches I've ever heard. Embodied his grace and patriotism. If only more politicians were of his calibre. RIP

I get why you're confused. You're referring to the long gone days when there was a real President in the White House like @BarackObama , not some vindictive self-absorbed racist piece of white trash like @realDonaldTrump . Don't worry, he won't squat there much longer.
You mean 45, Jill! @BarackObama is 44!
@BarackObama pls follow me dad

@BarackObama Little League World Champions! 6ABC led with famous Hawaiian. Would you sing 'Tiny Bubbles'?
It will always be @BarackObama . I have never felt more proud to be a US Citizen. I hope to feel that way again one day.
Hey remember when @BarackObama announced a reporter had been decapitated by isis and then went golfing right after good times
@BarackObama DUMB FUCK
I too, will not be attending @SenJohnMcCain 's funeral. But the difference is I would be welcome if I did decide to show up, unlike Durrumptruck. But at least the POTUS will be there, the actual last decent one we had since I believe @BarackObama can be called POTUS still.
