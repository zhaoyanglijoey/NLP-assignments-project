6 days ago @chuckschumer told me this economy was thanks to @BarackObama .
I'm just hoping that all the good that @BarackObama did isn't being shredded by this cretin. #DonTheCon pic.twitter.com/71j50TgJ9H
Still waiting to see who @realDonaldTrump blames for the recent stock market volatility - maybe @BarackObama or even @HillaryClinton - we know he only takes credit for all time highs
The Stock Market crashed on your watch Mr. @POTUS , The biggest loss in history. You are responsible for the lowest drop in the #DowJoans . not @BarackObama , not @HillaryClinton . You and your administration.
Obviously @BarackObama snuck back into the @WhiteHouse today and pulled down on the lever that @realdonaldtrump uses to make the stock market go so bigly.
With what we know about @SenJohnMcCain & @MittRomney it's good they lost. Had @BarackObama & @TheDemocrats not been so cocky & brazen we might not have ended up with @realDonaldTrump to set things right. Thank you God!
On this day in history: @BarackObama became the first Black president of the Harvard Law Review! Last year, @imeimeumana became the first Black woman selected as the Review's president! Last month, Michael Thomas was elected the 3rd Black president! #BlackHistoryMonth pic.twitter.com/LpxHkW8Trx
So when they go up, that's good and because of Trump (even though they went up under @BarackObama too), but when they go down, that's fine too?
@realDonaldTrump what has @BarackObama done to cause the Record (biggest ever!) fall in the Dow Jones?

@RealDonaldTrump blames @BarackObama / @HillaryClinton for the +1000 point losses in the stock market in 3...2...1...because of course it is all a biased deep state/DOJ/FBI/Democratic conspiracy against him.

Reason @BarackObama economy was stalled and never made it down to everyday pay increases is because his agenda was to make us #Socialist and all evenly #Poor . His goal was never to let you think you could raise your security. He wanted ppl dependant on Big Gov pic.twitter.com/rHtEwvXiFR

FACT: Under @BarackObama the #DowJones Industrial average never dropped more than 650 points in a single day. Under @POTUS it has happened 2x in just over 1 year. Tell me again @realDonaldTrump , about how well the stock market is doing b/c of your presence... #Resist #Trump
Why dear when the #democrats controlled congress and WH did they not pass a bill and have @BarackObama sign it which is how the Constitution works when you want change immigration laws in this country???

It took the Dow Jones 1460 days to climb from 14,000 to 15,000 under @barackobama It took just 2 days to lose 1,840 points under @realDonaldTrump Judging Presidents based upon stock market performance over a random period of time is clearly sound reasoning. @aaronjcarpenter

Hey traitor @BarackObama you tried to claim the market rise was your fault. Is the drop the last two days your fault too then, a-hole? America became great again once the sulfuric stench you left was removed from the White House.
Don't worry: Trump will find a way to blame it on @BarackObama like he does with other issues that are his own fault

@realDonaldTrump Democrats should be careful making fun of #Trump over the #stockmarket crash. It is the 8 years of @BarackObama printing TRILLION$ and the fear of resulting inflation that is the culprit here. This has nothing to do with @potus Trump!

I knew he would somehow blame @BarackObama for anything negative happening. But this is Trumps' $$$$game he is so fond of. He should have taken a few economics classes to smarten up a bit like Obama did himself.
How is @realDonaldTrump going to blame the market slump on @BarackObama today?

This is nothing but a bunch of fancy ass words strewn together by Satan's Mistress to try and sound impressive when they mean absolutely nothing at all. We have had prosperity over the last several years thanks to the fiscal policies of President @BarackObama #ShitHoleTrump
The @BarackObama administration spied on the @realDonaldTrump team before he was electected, president...That's it folks the bottom line...
So lemme get this right: Republicans actively wishing, working and praying for @BarackObama to fail was patriotic, but not applauding for @realDonaldTrump was treasonous? Who the fuck died and make you Elvis you sack of stinking shit?
And you did it in a little over a year!! Always trying to one up @BarackObama Well hell I bet this is one stinking fish you wish you could throw back, but oh well own it, stuff it and mount it on your wall in the Oval Office!

@BarackObama took credit for the bull market right up until the moment it began to drop. What a joke.
Dow down over 1100 pts. yes, we are open for business, as long as you can tolerate an unstable leader who has no clue how to run the country and will blame @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama for today's loss. No, wait I forgot he will blame the FBI.

@CNNPolitics @ftfinancenews So if it was due to @BarackObama being President that the #StockMarket dropped before, then isn't it Donald Trump's fault today?

@BarackObama Donald Trump may rescind everything you did because you are Black and because he is prejudiced, but he cannot take from you that you brought the US out of the 2008 recession. Many thanks to you for all your good work.
@NYSE down over 2K points. Do it took @realDonaldTrump one year to undo what it took @BarackObama 8 years to build?
Hey Sean...do you think Democrats are treasonous for not clapping for @POTUS like @realDonaldTrump ... If yes, do you think @GOP was treasonous when they didn't clap for @BarackObama
White supremacists always attempt to distract their nations with either war or jobs. @realDonaldTrump first attempts to claim credit for jobs resulting from @BarackObama 's policies; then the biggest EVER points drop on the Dow Jones. Welcome to the worst US President ever.
So is @BarackObama still responsible for the stock market now? #Askingforafriend
Absolutely!! It's sickening because we don't even know who we can trust or complain to. For the most part, SSA'S and SAC'S tow the line, so not much we can do. I'd love to see @Comey and @EricHolder in prison, next cell over from @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama , for starters
Everything negative for @BarackObama 8 years was blamed on Bush. Everything great in @realDonaldTrump first year, he tried to take credit for, including the Bull Market. Now we see a drop, and suddenly DEMs blaming Trump. #SwampRats

Y'all remember when @BarackObama called his colleagues across the aisle #Treasonous because they didn't like the things he said? Yeah, me neither. #TreasonousTrump #SOTU #adultdaycare
By "long-term economic fundamentals," they must mean the strong trends shaped by 8 years of @BarackObama 's leadership.

I am sure @realDonaldTrump will find a way to blame today's #StockMarketCrash on @BarackObama But, no deal! You take the credit, you take the blame Donny boy.
Hey @realDonaldTrump ! You should have a new #Memo released that explains how the economy is yours, but the #StockMarketCrash belongs to @BarackObama .
After scrolling through @realDonaldTrump tweets, I like to go to @BarackObama and cleanse myself. Thanks, Obama.
I guess @BarackObama and the Democrats leaders like @NancyPelosi thought that this kind of bonus being CRUMBS.... there were not even worth given, so they didn't!
Hey @realDonaldTrump if @BarackObama thought like you.. you would be in jail for not bowing to him. Some tell #Trump he serves the public WE do not serve YOU
Did @BarackObama , the most hated President by the #GOP , ever refer to any member of that party as treasonous or Un-American @PRyan @SenateMajLdr ? Are you ashamed of yourself yet? For a tax-cut and the chance to remove #Healthcare , you are enabling the destruction of #democracy

If this were @BarackObama 's third term the Stock Market news would be different -- because he knew how to *build* a strong economy. Everything Trump touches dies. pic.twitter.com/0IRLni2Pac
WOW, THEY DID IT.... @FoxNews blames the "Largest One Day Drop in the Stock Market in History" on Obama's Era of 'low inflation'. "Obama gave Trump an economy like a booby-trap. It was rigged to collapse." @BarackObama @potus @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends pic.twitter.com/f3hNPS3SqT
@realDonaldTrump Quote 'the Trump never talks about #StockMarket - no time to see the figures- in fact I never look at the #StockMarket -don't know the.. It's because of the mess of @BarackObama and because of the Uranium deal of #CrookedHillary pic.twitter.com/tcnDH4RGjR
The White Supremacist, con-man Trump, is upset that he's not being lauded for taking credit from the coattails of @BarackObama
#thefive @TheJuanWilliams Juan you claim nothing came of the Benghazi hearings 1) @HillaryClinton lied,2) @AmbRice44 lied,3) @BarackObama lied, pretty easy to see the common thread here
Tell the giant blowhard to take a long hard look back on @BarackObama #SOTU - ALL EIGHT YEARS OF THEM! #Resist
Congratulations to @DNC , @TheDemocrats @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton ! You did it! With bogus #collusion narrative, #sanctuary city/states, and breathtaking CORRUPTION you've brought the nation to the brink of Civil War 2.0!!! How can #WeThePeople possibly thank you enough?
@sjferg1252 @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Nostra-dumbass ......
Well Mr @BarackObama sir ...i hope groups like BLM.. acknowledged this absorb it ...this is the way to go about making a difference or change ...do it right ...this aggression is not the tactic..good luck
I think it's about time @Timmyhoover and I were mentioned in the same tweet as @BarackObama #progress
I love how people were so excited about how the market was doing under @realDonaldTrump ... or was it just the residual of the market @BarackObama left behind? I believe the answer is in today's drop. #JustSayin '
You mean Republicans like this? Remember all those times @BarackObama and @TheDemocrats had special days at the White House honoring folk like #FreddieGray , #EricGarner , #MichaelBrown .... #Theyareallthesame #BLueLivesMurder #Fuckthepolice pic.twitter.com/qtmk6btggz
Speaking of ratings, President @BarackObama is about to break 100 million followers! Good job Mr President! #bringback44 #BlueWaveIsComing
Doubled over the course of 8 years? Report on how much it has gained in the last year, and compare to any single year during the #Obama years. Based on the gains of the last year, I'd venture to predict @POTUS 8 years will far outpace @BarackObama 's 8 years of moderate gains.
Incredible. Burger King's fryer is down, so no fries. I don't remember this happening when @BarackObama was president.
Looking forward to seeing @MichelleObama this evening! #LeadersBellCCMM @Montreal @HillaryClinton @BarackObama #Gratitude pic.twitter.com/mpIlkTXgjJ
I most definitely gve @BarackObama #Credit 4 USAs recovery frm t #2008Recession & I cnt belve Im syn ths but I'll giv #Credit 2 @realDonaldTrump 2. 45 gts crdt 4 t #GOPTAXSCAM tht is abt 2 tke back t $ he gve 2 t #Top02Percent ! Sorry 45ers. If ur not #Rich Trump cares less abt u
@barackobama More likely than not, has his own server in his basement, just like @hillaryclinton , loaded to capacity with illegal dumps of government secure server data, collected by the NSA! @RepMaxineWaters explains for us just how YUGE His DataBase Is! @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan
And since @BarackObama has said he was the reason the #stockmarket was doing so well I guess this is his responsibility too!
Well, this is the time for @BarackObama to come forward and say that the economic achievements of #Trump administration is a result of what he's done during his term.
@CNBCFastMoney @realDonaldTrump just got lucky with the measured, thoughtful policies and 8 yr growth trend of @BarackObama .
Still one of my favorite Abigail learning memories! @TheRock @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/6fY0l6qZjU
@Barackobama May 9, 1998
Will @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton be indicted for their crimes against America?
Missing Michelle Obama in Montreal tonight because my son is sick. At least my husband can go and tell me all about it. Thanks @MichelleObama and @BarackObama for helping to make this a world where I can even say that! @chambremontreal
We all know how much you love ratings @realDonaldTrump so here's one for, President @BarackObama is about to break 100 million followers! Good job Mr President! #bringback44 #BlueWaveIsComing
@BarackObama with respect you are a very good looking man Mr President!
Is this your idea of #Winning ? America needs @BarackObama back to fix this mess! #WorstPOTUSEver @GOP & @POTUS need to go! #ImpeachThemAll #AmericaNeedsHealthcare #SaveDREAMers #NoWall #NotMyPresident #AmericaFirst ?? Another record that @POTUS won't tweet about pic.twitter.com/46BtTlF8Gy
@repAdamSchiff little poodle Schiff has to protect his master @BarackObama at all cost. FISA Abuse will ultimately point to the highest level in Obama WH which is POTUS44 pic.twitter.com/NVAxkMoWz6
@BarackObama PLEASE BE OUR PRESIDENT AGAIN?! PLEASE?!!!!??? YOU WERE THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO THIS COUNTRY!!!!!!
Gee... thanks, @BarackObama
Someone needs a lesson in Democracy, and in history. While @realdonaldtrump might find such behavior unseemly, @BarackObama had an uncouth buffoon shout "Liar!" in the middle of one of his addresses. But Obama knows the Constitution, and has read the first amendment. #Resist
Taking bets here on whether @realDonaldTrump blames stock market free fall on @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump the GOP reaction to one of @BarackObama #SOTU speeches. The opposition party always sits on their hands. Republicans must be treasonous... #GOP #DNC pic.twitter.com/2Av1JNW62N
Since @realDonaldTrump is so obsessed with ratings here's one for him. I was just on @BarackObama 's twitter page and he's about to break 100 million followers! Good job Mr. President we miss you! #bringback44 #BlueWaveIsComing
Also if that was treasonous what about all of the gop who disrespected @BarackObama not only at a SOTU but everywhere everyday.
@realDonaldTrump who is to blame for @DowJones @DNC - for not clapping @DeptJusticeIRL - no loyality @FBI - for investigation @HillaryClinton - for not winning @BarackObama - for not running Anyone but Russia!!! #PutinPuppet
Hellooo @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @Comey @PreetBharara @SenFranken @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJoeKennedy @SenBooker
And that hypocrite tRump is well aware of the outrageous republican behavior during @BarackObama 's 1st SOTU.
Are you learning impaired? @BarackObama mentioning Stock Market gains 12 times in 8 years is hardly the same a Trump's constant bragging #TrumpStockCrash
N O O N E ! ! ! @GOP @TheDemocrats @funder @DNC @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton @CNNPolitics @Acosta @donlemon @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @maddow @JoyAnnReid @TheEllenShow @GeorgeTakei @georgesoros @SenKamalaHarris @Comey pic.twitter.com/7buNXcfKGS
So who is to blame? crooked hillary or not american @BarackObama #StockMarketCrash @realDonaldTrump what's your explanation bragging #Stablegenius .
Remember when @CongJoeWIlson screamed "You lie!" during @BarackObama 's #SPOTU ? What about Justice Alito saying "not true" during another one? No one cried "treason" then.
Where are the cuffs and prison? @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @Comey @PreetBharara @SenFranken @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJoeKennedy
That's the problem. If this was @BarackObama saying and doing the things Trump does he would be impeached and jailed.
you mean @BarackObama 9 TRILLION in dept problem , short memories
I don't see any tweets from @BarackObama about the Wow? Geez, the Orange buffoon has tweeted at least 20 times in the last uear. Well, I was taught you own the consequences, good or bad. He's bragged about the increases so he owns the slide.
By his own standard Trump would be guilty for saying @BarackObama was not an American.
They been saying its @BarackObama stock market bet now they call it @realDonaldTrump #StockMarketCrash
#Trump can't blame this one on @BarackObama . Dow and S.&P. Drop by More Than 4%, Extending Stock Sell-Off https:// nyti.ms/2FLrGCd #TrumpLies #GOPTaxScam
If he does, than I want the cuffs out and he goes to prison @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @Comey @PreetBharara @SenFranken @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu
@BarackObama please manda o @dustinhendxrson add you in the group
@TheFive Keep hearing about the Russians meddling in the election for @realDonaldTrump but @BarackObama new about the Russians meddling a year prior to the election and did nothing! No collusion with Trump! Collusion definitely with Obama, @HillaryClinton and Deep State
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr #GOPTaxScamBill causes #DowJones to drop nearly 1600 points during Monday trading session and is worse than any day under @BarackObama #MAGA #LazyBoy
The Dow fell more than 1,100 points, or about 4.6%, for its largest single-day point decline ever. IS @realDonaldTrump going to own this like he did the gains? You know, the same DOW that was a lie when @BarackObama was a true leader? The one he touted a few days ago?
Failed @BarackObama never had such a big beautiful market crash
Democracy doesn't work LIKE YOU @NancyPelosi It's funny how the Democratic party projects on the Republicans what THEY THEMSELVES are guilty of~! Thinking we are suppose to pay homage to @BarackObama Take a look in the mirror and quit sucking on your teeth~!
Prison @HillaryClinton @BarackObama #Criminals
BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump undecided as to who to blame for the #Dow tanking. @HillaryClinton , @BarackObama , @FBI ? So many choices!
So, does that mean that every time @realDonaldTrump accused @BarackObama of not being a U.S. citizen, he was committing treason? Asking for a friend... pic.twitter.com/hxTBaMz6Ek
I remember the dark days of the economic crisis in 2008. @BarackObama spent two terms correcting the ship that the GOP crashed on the shore. And in one year's time the market "corrects" so severely, the entire global market shudders. Here we go again, @GOP
@SenSchumer go to hell already! We the People have a great President.. You on he other hand might be the biggest TRAITOR in American history.. @NancyPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @BarackObama @SenWarren @SenSanders @Comey and the whole @DNC are right in line behind you.. #trump2020
YES!! We love you Barack! @BarackObama ....And of course our beauty girl gets her props too! pic.twitter.com/OPFFQ6ebMc
