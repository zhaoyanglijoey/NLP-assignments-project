@BarackObama You deliberately chose a portrait artistwho is a racist; portrayed black women with severed white women's heads; who glorified the Black Panthers. Spent 8 yrs with lies you spewed at gullible U.S. citizens, while working against the U.S. Represents you perfectly.

I will take a wild guess & assume that u are not fond of our magnificent #POTUS44 . I am sad for u & can assure u that it is ur loss! I like so many others love @BarackObama & appreciate the class, intellect, leadership & integrity that he & @MichelleObama brought 2 our nation.
You forgot @BarackObama
The worst is the pathetic double standards of the left. Media constantly accuses Trump of being racist, while @BarackObama takes pics with Louis Farrakhan and gets his painting done by a vile black supremacist. Divider-in-Chief is his legacy.

You guys do realize @BarackObama accused Cambridge police officers of being stupid....Oh wait, I forgot you are biased...
I would say President @BarackObama handled it exactly how it should have been handled. There was already a concern (perhaps intel) about Russia working with trump and he wanted the investigation to continue as it should.

I gotta say, noted #WhiteSox fan @BarackObama 's official portrait in front of the #Cubs ' #WrigleyField ivy is one helluva call for unity.
Tribalism is on full display now. Can you imagine the collective strokes these people would be having if @BarackObama had done a MOLECULE'S worth of the damage Trump has done? Despite it all, the defense of Trump reminds me of the old saying: "White dog don't eat white dog."
