@BarackObama The world needs to go after Trump for violations against human rights citing the treatment of immigrant children! Trump is guilty of violating their human rights!
He also is reminding us hes about to pass more strict gun control than @BarackObama did with this BS bump stock ban
New book @BarackObama ? I might read this. pic.twitter.com/NJSWELCGWl
A naked @kanyewest and @realDonaldTrump sitting on a bed with a yellow stream of piss splashing onto their faces. They are lapping it up, licking it off each others hairy nipples. The camera pans up to the origin of the piss and its @BarackObama big cock. Its all Obama's fault!

So true. It's always the past. Bringing up @BarackObama 2 blame 4 their mistakes. It's everyone else's except theirs. Narcissists. #Narcissists #VoteBlue2018 #flipthesenate #flipthehouse
This @kanyewest stuff reminds me of the great and wise instinct of @BarackObama . How wise a President we once had, knowing not to connect himself with Ye. I wish I were as wise. Naming my son Nicholas Kanye has been quite regrettable as of late. Smh.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama please endorse @Nate_McMurray for #ny27 . After 8 years of absentee representation from @RepChrisCollins we need fair, honest and progressive representation in dc. Collins is too busy preparing to defend himself in court to provide us with the leadership we need.
I'm still trying to figure out why Crooked Hillary and @BarackObama are still talking? Why is O trying to take credit for Trump's economy? Hey Barack, when is the last time you sat down with an average American? I voted for you once. And you still forgot the middle class. SAD!
@BarackObama You didn't build this.
Another reason to like @BarackObama
What? What policy did #HillaryClinton draft? Children were not placed in cages when @BarackObama or George Bush were in office. Take responsibility 4 voting in an incompetent person. #VoteBlue2018 #flipthesenate #flipthehouse
If any @FoxNews correspondent had the decorum of these @CNN WH second rate junior college journalists during @BarackObama terms, these people would be freaking the hell out. This, @CNN , this is WHY you're losing viewers faster than . #CNNSucks
@MikeDeWine has a history of working across the aisle. @RichCordray teamed up with @BarackObama to pull this country apart.
@BarackObama - We Central Valley Voters in CD22 want to know WHY you have NOT ENDORSED @JanzforCongress in his race against Devin Nunes? Ol' Lujan and the DCCC have played politics for too long here in our Central Valley.
Hey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump is wiping away your "legacy", like with a cloth...
@kanyewest @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO @BarackObama Ye said it best on @TMZLive "I support our president, no matter who it is". The left is hell bent on steering America onto the rocky shores at their own expense. Ye has grown and is growing.
@BarackObama is this the real 44 president of the United States

Such a #FuckingMoron . @LindseyGrahamSC There was nothing @BarackObama could have done about #Crimea without risking a #war with #Putin , but your buddy @RealDonaldTrump actually #lost the entire #USA to #Russia .
Let's see- @BarackObama drank beer , smoked weed ,& did cocaine. @RepMaxineWaters we missed your condemnation.Were you pissed when you weren't invited to the 'Beer Summit' at the WH? @DNC is out of control.Can't be trusted to do people's business.
@BarackObama cnt believe u r endorsing Cortez & Gollum. U KNOW wht Socialism wl Do to this country. U must really not care for USA
Dear @BarackObama come back to us pls. Sincerely, America.
Sometimes I find myself feeling down but the sheer thought of President @BarackObama listening to the #Carter5 lifts me right back up
Congratulations to MN House candidates @MalikForMN , @zackstephenson and @KellyForUs for their campaigns getting endorsement from @BarackObama ! Very proud of them! pic.twitter.com/j9my7Ej2zm
It's terrific that @BarackObama already has endorsed @ColinAllredTX who will represent North Texas in Congress so much better than Trump's stooge, Pete Sessions.

It's actually @BarackObama 's, the good stuff tho, and the bad stuff is the Russians
Cordray knows zero about South-East Ohio because he only cares about Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati. When @BarackObama was waging a war on coal, killing jobs in this region of Ohio he was serving in his administration. #OHGovDebate
Mr. President @BarackObama your still my Presdient lol..What do you feel African-American people need to do before we become extinct? It seems we only care about meaningless and self-destructive elements within the Black communities. #Thoughts

@BarackObama endorsed Socialist Maryland Gubernatorial Candidate Ben Jealous, a @georgesoros backed puppet for the left.

I wish @BarackObama still gave us playlists. Those always bumped.
@BarackObama who is a black man and has a black wife were in the white house for 8years but never did this yet they were true Afrikaans. Smh
Somewhere between eight years of treating @BarackObama as poorly as possible--including the #MerrickGarland seat theft--and two years of Trump, I really can't hear anything anyone is saying about "tribalism." That gauntlet was thrown down long ago. #Midterms #2020 #LetsGetAtIt
A big thank you to @BarackObama for his foundational work in getting the big #trade deal done.

@BarackObama You never ran a lemonade stand so it stands to reason you couldn't grasp basic economics. President Trump is making you look like the neophyte you were for 8 long, terrible years. You should have called him. He would have been glad to help! He's a Patriot! You're not

Please! This is a request to all conservatives and clear-thinking Americans. Please find the nearest liberal and demonstrate 'boofing' for them. I mean, (as @BarackObama says), "get in their face"! Poor libs are disadvantaged not knowing this critical function!

Isn't that Obama's total number of press briefings 2014-2016? Oh, wait, sorry, @BarackObama was deified by the media, so he can't be critiqued. Sort of like Mao in China before his death. Sorry I brought it up.
Please cite one time that @BarackObama lied under oath about his drug use in college.
@BarackObama Hi Barack I think Amnesty is agreat organisation but they put me in psychiatric hospital and abused my human rights in the U.K are you intersted
The RNC is supposed to pay about 70% of it I think. When 45 was bitching about POTUS @BarackObama campaigning for @HillaryClinton I inquired from DNC. Don't remember the exact figure. So in other words, Koch Bros. NRA, & other corrupt super pacs who fund the RNC.
