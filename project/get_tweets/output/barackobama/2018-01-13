Open your Bibles, and see what Father has to say, after all you believed lying politicians -- many of whom I warned people about 8 years ago @BarackObama . My people now resent me for believing in work ethics,
What do you want to bet that @realDonaldTrump finally acknowledges that @BarackObama was born in Hawaii so he can blame this on him. Or, blame it on @HillaryClinton because Hillary and Hawaii both begin with an H. #TheResistance #ImpeachTrump #Hawaii @GOP @DNC
@BarackObama is my President
And @BarackObama s #FakeWorld

I remember when @BarackObama was "tweeting" about his big nuclear button
@BarackObama had 8 years to do this. Two years with Democrats running everything. Quit your political posturing!
Remember @BarackObama disappeared for weeks after leaving office to enjoy the Caribbean? Off-shore banks money depositing odyssey.
Watching @NetflixANZ @BarackObama interviewed by #Letterman . Sobering viewing. America, what have you done?
I am in awe of both of you and of course @BarackObama
We could #EASILY say that Lewis and @BarackObama Racists!
I miss @BarackObama SO much. We were blessed for 8 wonderful years. Interview was fantastic!
Let's ask the people of Haiti if that's true. I don't trust @snopes anymore than one of your used cigars. You and @BarackObama have insulted the trust of the American people with your greed, lies and policies.
@BarackObama you need to change your profile ... you are no longer the President. Thank God
I wonder if @BarackObama believes he was this great president or if hes just the biggest liar ever. I think both. I think its safe to say the worst two president are Jimmy Carter and Obama. Pick one for last. Its a fact that one is the worst just which one is the opinion

Trump University fraud, then $25M settlement. @BarackObama Birth Certificate. 3 millions illegal votes. Largest inauguration crowd. @PARISDENNARD
And it speaks volumes of how much @BarackObama cared about the people who worked with him in the WH

@deaconcruise @Franklin_Graham @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews HRC/Obama right. DT cult, Fox deplorables
@FoxNews @BarackObama And that planet is a you know what.
I guess I'll check @BarackObama Twitter for some comforting words about the Hawaii scare because you obviously won't mention it. #Hawaii
The David Letterman interview of @BarackObama is so pure & perfect.
@BarackObama @davidletterman this interview made me feel like I am hugging my pound puppy again. #ThanksObama #thanksletterman #hideinmyhole
Congrats Mr. President, you won the election but you've lost your mind. Btw, @BarackObama didn't whine on twitter.
Use the names @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama in positive remarks, and not in defending them. There are 100 negative remarks on social media for every positive one. I refuse to let their heritage only be seen from the Repubs perspective.
This whole thing is on your hero @BillClinton and his administration for making the deal that enabled North Korea to develop their nuclear program. And soon, because of your other hero @BarackObama , we'll be receiving the same threats from Iran. Reap what you sow.
Thanks @BarackObama
@DrCrane72 @BarackObama The Cult gets their info on a closed loop He made an excellent point Mainstream add is funny
Hmm @SenatorDurbin divulged things said in private and off the record - maybe we should divulge what he and #MichaelMadigan and or @BarackObama have talked about in private?
@POTUS @POTUSPress @POTUSPressPool @GOP @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SenSanders @BarackObama @foxandfriends @ggmsmolly @JohnSastri @old_osc I haven't felt like this since I was a kid. Durring the Cold War. The Cuban Missile Crises. Thanks for #MAGA tRUMP. pic.twitter.com/NGu2R6LTuV
@BarackObama is a smart man.
Que maravilla la entrevista de @DavidLetterman con @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/0vcXG9GmSD
If you want/need a reminder of what a president is supposed to be, watch @BarackObama 's interview with David Letterman on @netflix . I wept with gratitude that we were blessed to be led by this great man.

How much you wanna bet @SpeakerRyan would love to have @BarackObama back. Photo from 2/25/2010. pic.twitter.com/NGiJHDwZAO
I miss @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump indeed waved that magic wand @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump isn't concerned about #Hawaii . He thinks it's a territory of Kenya as evidenced by his insistence that @BarackObama was not born in the US.
@FoxNews @BarackObama Is such a loser. Obama administration was a criminal enterprise and Obama can't handle when the truth is told. Keep watching #FakeNewsCNN and keep living in your fantasy
@BarackObama Fox News is Great !!
@BarackObama Hey Barack, you said these jobs were gone and never coming back!! Hahaha!! MAGA! @ChelseyHandler @CNN @CNNPolitics
#2 priority- hiding all the illegal activities her and her buddy @BarackObama had their hands in. Sorry - not - sorry! You lost
I love how Dave keeps talking like @BarackObama is still President. We wish it were so too, Dave. #MyNextGuestNeedsNoIntroduction
. @Letterman @netflix Loved (x10) this new series. The first interview with @POTUS44 @BarackObama was outstanding. Great to have both of you back in my living room in Indiana again!
Sorry. Pres. Trump was not the one who hit that button. The same fear would have happened even if @BarackObama had been in office. Why not be happy that there was not an actual threat on our country. #UnityNotResistance
Just watched Netflix's #DavidLetterman show... with first guest (wait for it........) @BarackObama .. LOVED IT. Missed hearing n seeing Mr. President.
No, the fear is the result of @BarackObama coddling tyrannical dictators. You sowed the wind, now you reap the whirlwind. @realDonaldTrump had NOTHING to do w/ Hawaii's screw-up. #MoronAlert pic.twitter.com/bEp4U0wNtc
Because he is the top dog like when @BarackObama called Libya a shotsjoe or Clinton cigared Monica then told the entire nation he did not have sex with that woman @realDonaldTrump gets 5% positive news
@BarackObama pic.twitter.com/LggGz2bVdc
#MyNextGuestNeedsNoIntroduction was amazing with @BarackObama - brought me to tears, guys!
I know I'm late to the party but the @Letterman interview with @BarackObama is everything.
@FoxNews I suggest you host an hour-long debate between economists regarding whose policies are responsible for the market surge since the election. Some say @POTUS , some say @BarackObama . Who is right?
Or knew a coward like @BarackObama would never do anything to scare him or her
@BarackObama ... The Deferred Action president. #POS Now it's time for some real action from a real leader like President Donald J. Trump #DeportTheDreamers #IllegalsGot2Go #NoDACADeals #MAGA #KeepYourWordMrPresident pic.twitter.com/htHn01Mqg0
I miss @BarackObama
a decade created by the Republicans under the POTUS George Bush. Trump inherited an up economy created by the @TheDemocrats under the leadership of @BarackObama America. you are welcome. All U have to do is sustain growth.
That's because we knew @BarackObama would never do anything to protect us. @realDonaldTrump is respected by other countries because he isn't weak. I'd much rather have that than a coward leading our military
@whoisgarylee No one will ever again have to ask, Who is Gary Lee! Thank you for sharing your story about @BarackObama and your wonderful parents
Just watched Letterman's #MyNextGuest with @BarackObama . Time well spent. Watch if you can. It's on @netflix
@BarackObama pardoned him Or her at the time of imprisonment or after she he attempted suicide.
Long thread worth reading. We miss you @BarackObama !
@Barackobama May 19, 1998
Wow. Imitating @BarackObama . As PM should have more originallitty
I'd much rather live on the #FoxNews Planet than Planet #ShitHole where @BarackObama was taking us!
Bravo to David Letterman & @netflix . David's interview w/ @BarackObama and @repjohnlewis was excellent! I laughed, I cried & I laughed some more. The most moving interview I've ever seen Letterman conduct. Welcome back to the stage David. I hope everyone takes time to view.
#Shithole acceptable to Bias #MSM #Media only when Saint @BarackObama #Obama uses the word @POTUS pic.twitter.com/IUebco5tGn
If you want to be reminded of how a real president acts and reflects, watch Letterman's new show on @netflix and his hour-long interview with @BarackObama .
@BarackObama please come back this psycho, @realDonaldTrump , is actually going to get us killed.
Awesome story. So glad you worked for @BarackObama and of course, he and his administration were awesome so glad you had a great experience.
Wait! @FoxNews lied about something @BarackObama said? Colour me surprised.
Lol Look who is saying this? Did @BarackObama 's administration had anything to do with the UK's embassy deal? Did you correct that message, and many false statements that came from the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, for Gods sake YOU? SO mentally unstable.
Thank you @BarackObama for making me love you more now than I did before before #foreverobama

Dear #BlackPeople , This is Dick Durbin. The sleazy white dude who told you another whote dude said racist things about "sh!thole" countries, which two more white dudes denied hearing. He was also called a liar by many othed people in the past, including @BarackObama . Ask why. pic.twitter.com/bPrFB73Kai
@BarackObama .... worst president ever! In action is not acceptable and you sucked
No @BarackObama , you are living on a different planet. When you were first elected, I thought you were going to be a good president. I was wrong, you spoke of change for the better but your agenda was not for the better of the American People. It was for your betterment not ours
@BarackObama would have if he had run a third time
Thank you David Letterman, @BarackObama and @netflix for that much needed bright spot of thoughtfulness and hope
Trump is in same position. He's trying to fix a country PHUCKKED up by @BarackObama We're making strides EVERYDAY! #MAGA
Watching the interview from David #Letterman to @BarackObama . We miss you Mr. President
@Franklin_Graham @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
And @netflix my next guest with David Letterman and @BarackObama A reminder of better times and that not that long ago, America was actually great.
That's why @HillaryClinton should be in jail, along with @BarackObama @AGLynch @EricHolder @JamesComeyFBI @PeterStrzok and many other to lengthly to name.
@BarackObama @ObamaFoundation Sir you are paid for speeches to corrupt banks you fell to prosecute. Andy Cecere Phil Trier boast about being the most giving communities in the country.

@jamieleecurtis Afraid NOT on this @POTUS !! This is on @BarackObama 's 8 YEARS of patronizing & NEGLECT!! U want to pay N. Korea 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS for them to keep doing the same as they are doing NOW??
Took a day to go from "let's secure the border" to "pass a clean DACA bill immediately." @JohnKasich wants @BarackObama 's policy enshrined permanently and has stopped pretending he even wants conservative window-dressing. pic.twitter.com/CjfBAsvanC

@BarackObama Our planet is better than the fantasy you forced on us. You just don't get it. People would rather work than sit on their bottoms.
Watching @BarackObama on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction talk about when he first came into office with 2 wars and a failing economy. Let's just say, thank God @POTUS was not the President at the time.
@BarackObama Thanks for recommending McBride's FIVE-CARAT SOUL. Under Graham RR Box Car Set one of most inventive short stories I've read in last few years. I really enjoyed the Letterman show last night. You know we miss you!

If you think that this is going to end easily guess again. #TraitorTrump and his #Cult45 have been foaming at the mouth with their hatred of @BarackObama and all advancements he made. We are going to have to beat them down with #TheResistance #BlueTsunami2018 pic.twitter.com/YeDRKxLNVQ
. @BarackObama Mr. President, watching U on Mr. David Letterman's new @netflix show "My Next Guest" has only made us miss U & Flotus that much more. A pleasure to hear U speak about what U faced, accomplished & where U R now. Enjoy your peace & family time, you are so deserving.
@realDonaldTrump will not acknowledge anything abt Hawaii because that's where @BarackObama , Amazing President and the most Popular Man for the past 10 yrs, was born. DT's so jealous of him, he can't even pretend to act Presidential! DT's such an Embarrassment and Disgrace to US!
@BarackObama This is your legacy, Barry.

Thank you @BarackObama
Please send me a comment by @BarackObama in which he denigrated African people, Haitians, and Salvadorans.
The stock market was never anywhere close to where it is now under Obama @BarackObama @DonaldTrump
I just watched #MyNextGuestNeedsNoIntroduction on @netflix . It was great to have Letterman back on my TV, and his guest really needed no introduction. So, why did I start to cry soon as as @BarackObama walked on stage? I miss his intelligence, wit, wisdom and compassion so much.
