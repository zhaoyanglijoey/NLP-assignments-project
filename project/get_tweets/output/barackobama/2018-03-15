@BarackObama Dammit B Can We Have You Back #BestPresident
@BarackObama #SocialismSucks Remember how you praised Venezuela? How did that work out? #AntiAmerican fool!
. @BarackObama with the prescient upset pick. My guess is he just chose the Chicago squad.
which celebrity wants to play fortnite with me and the boys tonight @playboicarti @LILUZIVERT @BarackObama
@BarackObama . this would be legendary at its best
. @BarackObama isn't playing around with his bracket. He picked his hometown Loyola-Chicago to win over Miami. Today, they did just that in buzzer-beater fashion. He probably had the same reaction as @WTKR3 's @AdamWinkSports . (Pretty much a "WHOOOOO!!!" *clap clap clap clap* ) pic.twitter.com/EuFCkXNYlD
@TimRyan is a liberal his tone is just different in that he is sympathetic to WWC voters I have no problem with that @BarackObama was the same way as is Joe Biden @moveon @theyoungturks @tpm @nytimes @washingtonpost @motherjones @thedemocrats
@siafalewisnbc ! Even @BarackObama is showing our @RamblersMBB some #OnwardLU #NoFinishLine #NoLimitsAllowed | @Loyola_Alumni @LoyolaChicago @LoyolaRamblers pic.twitter.com/6TGLMJE3Hb

@BarackObama General Mattis reports Isis has splintered off into many different factional groups around the world & are extremely dangerous today but we have this to all thank Barack Obama for these are his Muslim brothers & he refused to take action other than to let them grow
@CodyRhodes is @BarackObama all in?
I am having a really hard time recalling #President @BarackObama having a State Dept that ignored the law or Disrespected & lied to other world leaders then joked about it We have entered the Theater Of the Absurd no exit in site....
Retweeted Barack Obama ( @BarackObama ): Congrats to @LoyolaChicago and Sister Jean for a last-second upset - I had faith in my pick!
Putin gaining leverage, strength, and ME victories. @BarackObama treated #Putin like he did ISIS: just another "JV team." Wrong--again.
to be fair @BarackObama had no patriotism and wanted America to fail.
@BarackObama has a lot to be proud of, doesn't he!
@Kevfeige @MarvelStudios you know a dope idea... cast @BarackObama as the president in the MCU! That would be legiiiiit. @RobertDowneyJr Tonk Stark interacting with him would be great. @SamuelLJackson you know you want it too.
@BarackObama aka Barry didn't but his Muslim brotherhood commit real assaults and rapes. Ask Sweden.
lets goooooo RT @BarackObama : Congrats to @LoyolaChicago and Sister Jean for a last-second upset - I had faith in my pick!
I see your bracket was ruined just like @BarackObama . Never bet against @RhodyMBB !
@BarackObama we all miss you both! Need a laugh? My kitty, Miss Petunia has a trap set to try and catch a leprachaun! I wonder if she will?? I love you all! pic.twitter.com/5TndtMuCbK
President @BarackObama made another big mistake by leaving @SFASU @SFA_MBB out of his #MarchMadness bracket #AxeEm
You picked @LoyolaChicago @BarackObama , nice pick!
Six ways Trump can help stop Russian meddling @CNN http:// cnn.it/2Gu27ae I've got a great one! @cnn Don't do with @barackobama and @ambassadorrice did. It's that simple.

#SDSU bracket buster. Still at it @BarackObama !
@BarackObama must be feeling like dang White People had no clue how good I was? Because, every day there is some craziness while @realDonaldTrump has been in the @WhiteHouse #MAGA #LOSERS #BlueWave2018
@BarackObama I created 2 universes.
Dont think Obamas wud ever be in that situation. Never ever coz they did not sign a deal- they did not fell but they rise in love n wedded. Let the situation of deal making for marriage be with Trump Clan. @BarackObama @MichelleObama

Omg, right? I miss having a smart, articulate, capable, President. The disparity between @BarackObama , and Trump cannot be expressed.

My guess? Iran used the gold that @BarackObama gave them so they could buy the Uranium that @HillaryClinton sold to Russia!

Well whadda ya know - this proves I have something in common with @BarackObama besides devilish good looks and a gorgeous wife lol
I need to see your board @BarackObama post it
I didn't pay attention while @BarackObama built his legacy, but I've sure as hell watched this administration try to burn it down! And that's what's NOT gonna happen. P.S. I'm reading #RussianRouletteBook and Obama, man you screwed the pooch with Russia!
I wonder how much it bothers @realDonaldTrump that @BarackObama has twice the #of @Twitter followers?
@BarackObama would have been the best president ever if he was a white man with the same agenda and attitude, he faced hate and opposition on all of his policies only because he is a black man.. A wonderful black man..You will be loved by many and hated by few, forever..

@BarackObama Thank you sir for that last minute advice, thanx to you I have a Flawless Bracket so far. Thanx again, Mr. President pic.twitter.com/gn4kFbcV3v
@BarackObama Equations of universe creation.
I was just thinking, after watching @AriMelber and 15 minutes of @hardball (both programs talking about Trump): If @BarackObama had done ANY of the crap that Trump has done, the Republicans would have called for him to be burned at the stake.
Thanks @BarackObama and @MichelleObama http://www. mixcloud.com/hermansmeets greetz you all!! #Mixcloud
@BarackObama This is a March madness bracket pool.....the big yearly college basketball tournament. #bouncetheballdontkickit
Well there you go again! Bet, I could care less about the rest of the World because they know how to hold their hand out for USA to fill it up. Movement, only to save my USA from Democrats giving it away. Debt, look back at @BarackObama for a nothing benefit increase.
@BarackObama u.faget Leav the usa
Save us @BarackObama . Our country is in serious trouble. Glad you are enjoying March Madness but we need a voice of reason.
@BarackObama The People want like a Hope,mean need you can Back to The White House @WhiteHouse
@BarackObama Now that you're no longer responsible for a nation . . . ever thought about approaching BBC's Top Gear to be their Star in a Reasonably Fast Car? Pretty sure you'd be the biggest thing that would ever happen on that show.

So . @EricHolder . @BarackObama . @TheDemocrats are responsible for this and they are crying foul now. #Shameful ! #WakeUpAmerica
I haven't reacted to and wanted to support a candidate like @BetoORourke since @BarackObama . He's a leader we need. If you live in TX, please consider him this November. I'm excited to vote for him for President sometime soon after.
