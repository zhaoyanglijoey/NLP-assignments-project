Just know, Mr.President, @BarackObama , if you need any answers or insight (I don't know if you're a regular watcher of the show), rest assured, I'm here to help. #LegendsofTomorrow
Well, @BarackObama didn't take me up on my offer to watch tonight's #LegendsOfTomorrow , an episode in which he plays a major role; but I will not take that personally, I'm sure he's got a lot on his plate.
My other interview today was with @Austan_Goolsbee , and @BarackObama still lives here, so maybe third-smartest Chicagoan?
The only reason @realDonaldTrump wanted to be president is because he was the victim of an impromptu roast hosted by @BarackObama at the correspondence dinner and he felt the need to have people take him serious. Mission failed Mr. #FakePresident !
@BarackObama Make a hole.
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @GeorgeHWBush @JoeBiden The American people (as well as most Canadians) are feeling highly anxious over the Trump Administration and @GOP as a whole. This is not news, but is there nothing you, as former Presidents,and VP, can do?
I miss rationality in politics. And of course that most rational of presidents @BarackObama

@BarackObama : Your #MarchMadness2018 #NCAA bracket for the women won our office pool! It was $50. I owe you a cut! Would you prefer your half in cash, in snacks, or to a charity of your choice?

@julissaarce You should be upset with @BarackObama for signing an #unconstitutional #executiveorder that he claimed was not legal! @POTUS said wants to help #DACA but needs to secure the border and fix #immigration , which @TheDemocrats want as a #2018TalkingPoint , & no solution!

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump 's approval rating just continues to grow, now reaching levels that @BarackObama failed to attain at this time during his Presidency during 2010. Obama needs to close down his Shadow Govt, call off his Deep State attack dogs, take his marbles & go home.

@BarackObama Just want you to know that YOU'RE MISSED beyond what you could ever imagine. Amazing that our economy is doing so well because Trump waved his magic wand. You and your administration worked HARD to leave the new President what he is enjoying today. THANK YOU!

@RepGaramendi Stop blaming @realDonaldTrump for the #DACA problem - he did not start the issue. @BarackObama did by creating a status that he did not have legislative authority to create. Circuit Court has already struck down. That action will be found unconstitutional.
Worthless @barackobama . Did he do anything at all that was good? I don't think so
Easter Bunny was thought that he was visiting the house where @BarackObama @MichelleObama Malia and Sasha live.....
Sir Charles should also look in the mirror. If you are ticked at @POTUS supporters, guess what I was ticked at you and the other idiot @BarackObama voters. Funny we were not as unhinged as the TRUMP derangement syndrome people are. @greggutfeld was right about you on @TheFive

Disingenuous comparison. @BarackObama took office following the second worst year for the DJIA in a century. 19% appreciation during @POTUS tenure from a more normal base is stellar.
@FLOTUS looks so "happy" close to bald @realDonaldTrump much happier than @MichelleObama and @BarackObama
@RepGaramendi @BarackObama started this when he created the illegal DACA aka CACA Program. If these "kids" are upset they should talk to their illegal alien parents. DEPORT THEM ALL! pic.twitter.com/roSnywNBkS
In fact, @BarackObama #DACA was an illegal EO and belonged back in Congress where @POTUS put it as it should have been. Your party alone did nothing for #DREAMERS for 8 yrs and counting. You only cared this year for their votes.
@BarackObama in need of a ramp to better get me in and out. I can't afford to buy a power chair. With what I draw Military can get help with police officers can't. It's not right we protect here at home the military go over the water. Why can't we police get help.
The demand for ending tuition hikes is based on the fact that median income for black Americans has actually fallen since 2008. I guarantee that none of you guys will connect the dots and realize that 2008 was the year that @BarackObama was elected. #StudentPowerHU
Not a fan of @realDonaldTrump but, he is way better than @BarackObama Unemployment is down, less people on welfare and taxes are down. I specially love his choice for education. He is doing a lot of things right. Not a fan of trade wars though.

@BarackObama thank you for being our president and showing us that its possible without the hate and animosity that is the trade mark of trump .
@BarackObama was literally the coolest president we will ever have.
President Trump has held 23 joint press conferences, but it's been 400 days since the @POTUS has he @GeorgeHWBush : 27 Carter: 22 @BillCinton : 11 @BarackObama : 7 Reagan: 6 Nixon: 6 Ford: 4 Bush: 4 @realDonaldTrump : 1 are you scare tough guy?

My dream come true @BarackObama @MichelleObama
Like your work, but if you look at the #SPX (S&P500) since election day, @realDonaldTrump is still marginally ahead. Given the tax cuts are baked into the Trump numbers, it is still a poor result. I have no doubt that by the fall, @BarackObama will be ahead on the scoreboard.
Remember when @BarackObama called ISIS the al Qaeda JV team and everyone on @FoxNews (not least of which @seanhannity ) crowed over his lack of respect for the gravity of the situation but Trump is "a streadfast leader" for calling it as he sees it. Ah, memories. pic.twitter.com/UGvkAo7lMQ

But... but... didn't @realDonaldTrump criticize @BarackObama for not being transparent enough and for not holding enough press conferences? (By the way Mr. Obama, we miss you and need you, a REAL Christian and loyal American, back in government; Senate seat maybe?)
@funder do you really want to talk TREASON, Mr. Democrat/Leftist? @SenWarren went to Bejing to bad-mouth official US foreign policy. @BarackObama went to Cuba and coddled-up to the murderous Castro bros. dems have a history of treason...read some history and get educated, fooh!

Her, remember when Neil Munro of the Tucker Carlson-led Daily Caller screamed questions and insults @BarackObama during a Rose Garden presser about DACA? Remember how Carlson and the Fox News crowd vehemently defended Munro? Sanctions, my ass. At least Acosta was polite to Trump.

Stupid was when the @BarackObama regime imposed unrealistic timelines for new standards. He forced car makers to sacrifice safety for mileage. Shamefully electric vehicles only move the source of pollution, not the amount.
Why isn't the Trump Doctrine ("the systematic undoing of every single positive correction @BarackObama put forward") garnering more discussion? Are we that blind to not see that the Trump Doctrine is bullshit? This country's citizens are surely sheepeople. Btw, #tRUmpRUssia

They did vote for him and @BarackObama and @BillClinton - yep some Americans want a jerk for a president.

Bullshit @BarackObama 's economy sucked all he did was made part time jobs and healthcare sucks. My daughter got a letter today from her #Doctor stating he will not accept insurance any longer.

@realDonaldTrump took credit for @BarackObama 's careful stewardship & rebuilding of the economy during the stock market rise & now denies culpability for dismantling that success with a trade war, other destructive policies & a chaotic & impulsive governing style
Kind of like @BarackObama taught constitutional law?BWAAHHHHH HAAAHHHHHH!

@BarackObama you are a great man and human being, unlike that twit in the oval office now.
Yes, Trump killed DACA, but @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris et al. and @theDemocrats helped him bury it. All for $705M additional aid for Israel for a "perceived' threat from Iran.The Iran Policy Oversight Act 2015, Despite Pres. @BarackObama giving them $38B of aid...

Maybe if you were actually doing your job, we would have known the corruption going on in @BarackObama white house. Instead you act like a petulant child. The fact CNN has you as chief correspondent just shows you how irrelevant they are as a news source.
@BarackObama hello Mr.Obama! I have a very important question for a research paper I have to do! Would you mind just answering a simple question for me please? Thank you in advance!
The @realDonaldTrump presidency policy making: @Fox tell me did @BarackObama do it this way? - Reverse. He embarrassed me at the correspondence dinner and I am going to bring the USA down in revenge. That's my policy don't need advisors.
@jeffsessions has appointed a second special counsel to investigate the FBI/Hillary lawbreaking. And he's from Utah, outside the swamp. These people should be indicted: @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @lorettalynch @Comey @andrewmacabe @JohnBrennan
