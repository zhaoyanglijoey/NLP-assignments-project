Oh how I miss @BarackObama He is my #President
@BarackObama watched the memorial service for senator McCain. so good to see u and michelle Obama and to here your voice during these chaotic times!
Hearing @BarackObama and George Bush speak today at #McCainFuneral reminded me what it was like to hear an intelligent leader speak. So nice to hear eulogies from both sides today and set aside political differences.
I just watched @BarackObama speak at the funeral @SenJohnMcCain & it was well spoken & elequent & holy Jesus do I TRULY miss having a president. This is not a joke, I MISS having a person that knows how to act in public and who represents the country properly. Thank you Barry.
Start by erasing all the vitriolic articles and tweets the people who eulogizing him now wrote about his 2008 campaign. Looking at you @donlemon @HuffPost @BarackObama @nytimes @CNN
"our membership is based not on our bloodline, not on what we look like, what our last names are. Not based on where our parents or grandparents came from, or how recently they arrived, but on adherence to a common creed, that all of us are created equal." @BarackObama #McCain
Ok I think a rally for @BetoORourke hosted by @BarackObama and @MichelleObama is a good idea but perhaps a different musical guest or none
Got the message? She @MegahnMcCain kept asking Lucifer for more Cash to finish the job Hanoi-Hilton @SenJonMcCain couldn't finish http:// bit.ly/2os66fc via @BreitbartNews @NBCNews @ABC @CNN You try @BarackObama , you are much closer to Lucifer than most!
@realDonaldTrump So, your inauguration was half the size of @BarackObama even though you brought in $107 million & we're now finding out it was a venue for laundering Russian bribe money YOU'RE BREAKING ALL CORRUPTION RECORDS ON TOP OF BECOMING AN ILLEGITIMATE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
Is it me, or does @BarackObama seem to be looking at @MichelleObama and #GeorgeWBush and thinking: Yeah, that'll go viral.
@BarackObama Is so adorable in the beginning smiling like that Lol <3

I remember writing @BarackObama a letter when he first became president & I sent it thinking I was never going to get a letter back, then 6 months later I received a letter from him & I still have it. Gunna brag to my future grandkids about it one day lol.
Beautiful&Noble gesture to see our First Daughter @IvankaTrump &First Son-in-law @Jaredku , @BillClinton , @HillaryClinton , @GeorgeWBush , LauraBush @MichelleObama , @BarackObama , @SenJohnMcCain service. We must continue to embrace&recognize unity Always.Thank you all for Your Service
Hey @HillaryClinton @BarackObama #Gdubya @laurawbush @MichelleObama what did you all talk about back at the hotel why did you need a skiff setup? All those rooms had to be secured... @TuckerCarlson @mitchellvii @RudyGiuliani @LouDobbs @replouiegohmert
Thank you, @SenJohnMcCain , for banning @realDonaldTrump from your funeral so Americans could pretend @BarackObama was still our president for 2.5 hours. Our country felt comforted and peaceful again for a short while. RIP. We will try to live as you have.
America is and always will be great due to real presidents like @GeorgeHWBush @GeorgeWBush__ @BarackObama @jimmycarter so there is not a need for this crap today.
@BarackObama @realDonaldTrump
I think one of the great things from today's funeral of Senator #JohnMcCain is watching POTUS 43 pass candy to @MichelleObama and seeing @BarackObama chuckle. #Wecanallgetalong
Got the message? She @MegahnMcCain kept asking Lucifer for more Cash to finish the job Hanoi-Hilton @SenJonMcCain couldn't finish http:// bit.ly/2os66fc via @BreitbartNews @NBCNews @ABC @CNN You try @BarackObama , you are much closer to Lucifer than most!
@BarackObama @MeganMcCain POTUS DANALD TRUMP IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT LAST 8 Yrs of Obama was a shit hole
@GOP You guys spent the last 6 years of @BarackObama presidency obstructing everything including Merrick Garland nomination. Your way of winning is throug lies, cheating and Gerrymandering YOU CAN NOT TALK ABOUT OBSTRUCTION without looking in the mirror #TheResistance
@BarackObama was simply THE BEST President period. #ComeBackBarack
How was your day, dotard? I watched a very moving funeral on tv today. Lots of people were there. @BarackObama spoke and it was wonderful. So was Prez Bush's speech. Was just wondering why you weren't there. Oh wait...nm. pic.twitter.com/qF4BdhCuJi
If I'm @BarackObama I'm squaring up later with @43georgebush 1st..no candy for me? 2nd.Don't give my lady snacks, you pass it to me and I'll give it to her.
@BarackObama Sorry to have to correct you but, it should have been "make George and ME say nice things about him to a national audience".
@BarackObama & @GeorgeHWBush81 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS YOUR PRESIDENT & MINE TOO! pic.twitter.com/AKbXdiwu5m
You didn't learn a single thing from today's speeches about friendships, trust, honor, love for a country, shared values and that we are all equal. Watch the Funeral of a Hero again and listen carefully to @BarackObama @43georgebush and specially to @MeghanMcCain
@BarackObama SVP REVENEZ!!!!!

@BarackObama as the worst president ever, you sure did bash on Trump and his slogan for campaigning at johns funeral.. You guys take no break on hating on our president who has done more than you did in 8 years already
@BarackObama you are a disgrace to the United States of America!!! I should shoot myself in the face for voting for you your first term I will never forgive myself for voting for an illegal immigrant Go back to Kena
@BarackObama hey barack, GFY buddy.
Can you believe journalist NEVER reported about @keithellison @BarackObama and the #CongressionalBlackCaucus with Antisemitic and Racist @LouisFarrakhan - Suppressed Photo of Obama/Farrakhan for 12 years!! #WhyDoJournalistProtectDespicableDemocrats pic.twitter.com/krJP5j1Fsi
The line from Senator John McCain's funeral that is sticking with me hours later is when former President @BarackObama said: "When all was said and done, we were on the same team. We never doubted we were on the same team."

When the #JohnMcCain family go low @BarackObama goes MUCH lower, the classless act he is!
I think @BarackObama was speaking directly to you today Senator
@BarackObama as a Cdn neighbour that watched your thoughtful & articulate words today during the McCain service all I can say is your country needs leadership & understanding like you show. If only you could have been there 4 more yrs how different things would be. #respect
@BarackObama Best Presidential Eulogy today!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Thank you Mr. President for being the first in office in decades who hasn't been a complete and utter failure and let the nation down constantly (I'm referring to you @BarackObama @GWBLibrary @BillClinton )
sending PRAYERS for love and light to the LOSER CLUB ... @MichelleObama @BarackObama that you all RISE up from the depth of your deciet and infiltration and WHISTLE BLOW ! choose LOVE.
Nobody cares what this clown @BarackObama thinks! #MAGA #WalkAway #buildthewall #hillary4prison #obama4prison #DrainTheSwamp #CNNisFakeNews

@BarackObama Like school on Saturday Fat Albert No Class!
I think @BarackObama feels some type of way that George didn't bring any candy for him...only enough for sharing with his girl @MichelleObama
What amazing job @BarackObama and @MeghanMcCain and George Bush and all the speakers at #JohnMcCainFuneral were so moving , so emotional
LOW LIKES. YOU WISH YOU WERE @BarackObama
This was absolutely perfect in the respect shown and the eloquent way he spoke. @BarackObama thank you for showing us how amazing a president can be
This is who @BarackObama is. When the truth comes out about No Name it will all make sense and they will both be revealed as traitors. #QAnon pic.twitter.com/Eq1YZwukPw
@realDonaldTrump best president in American history already! @BarackObama the worst president in American history
Hearing @BarackObama voice and words is like wrapping myself in my favorite blanket. Miss that guy.
Not sure I have before seen an uplifting funeral but the last two definitely were. #ArethaFranklin #JohnMcCain Thank you to all planners and participants. @BillClinton @43georgebush @BarackObama @cindymccain
Lol @BarackObama @JoeBiden @MeghanMcCain @HilaryClinton_ News flash! @realDonaldTrump is Your President!!!!!MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & AGAIN!!
This is greatness @BarackObama https:// wapo.st/2PVH44E
hey @FoxNews ! the reason @BarackObama and #PresidentBush can be friends, is because they may have spoken ill of each others CHOICES, but never showed anything but respect to EACH OTHER. That's presidential behavior, teach your pet @realDonaldTrump about that
Grace and gravitas...and a touch of the goofy. Bless you, @BarackObama , for giving a grieving family the giggles for a moment. Thank you to all who came together to remind us of the goodness that lives on in the American spirit.
Mc Cain stood up against a voter to tell her @BarackObama was a good man but I never heard bho stand up against anyone including the MSM for calling McCain a racist and warmonger.
@HitJENKINZ @BarackObama @voodles1
love u king </3 @BarackObama
"The election is over, John. I won." - @BarackObama to @SenJohnMcCain during the health care summit on live TV to the world. YET, Trump was out and Obama was in. smdh
@BarackObama Thank you for your inspiring eulogy of Senator John McCain. It was great to hear you and President Bush speak so eloquently. I miss having a real president.
@BarackObama you were at the funeral to speak about the SEN. MCCAIN NOT TAKE MAKE REFERENCE TO OUR PRESIDENT YOU R A FAILURE THERE JUST LIKE WHEN U WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE
The economy was in shambles. Manufacturing was disappearing from America. Unemployment and participation in the workforce was historically bad. Welfare was at an all time high. Stock market lows.Thank you @BarackObama For allowing @realDonaldTrump To Make America Great Again.
Remember @JohnKerry @brhodes @AmbassadorRice @BarackObama said the #IranDeal was good
Watched @BarackObama give his eulogy for John McCain. I forgot what it was like to have a @POTUS that can form complete sentences and cogent thoughts.
@BarackObama Is continuing what he spent eight years doing, creating division in this country, instead of celebrating the life of McCain he takes the opportunity to attack Trump. Simply the most destructive President of our lifetime.
@BarackObama accomplishments. pic.twitter.com/FgCt9kmk0m
@BarackObama disappoints with every move ... from hope in 20018 to establishment puppet ... big money talks and he got himself in line as soon as he got into WH, now is one of the cheerleaders of the official establishment talking points #FAIL
@BarackObama nothing but #Class God Bless you Miss you Dearly
@FoxNews and all media WE DO NOT CARE TO HEAR SEE OR KNOW @BarackObama IS SPEAKING OR AROUND!!! GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK HEADS!!!
@BarackObama @JoeLieberman @MeghanMcCain SORRY @realDonaldTrump but these guys socked it to ya today at the #McCainFuneral and America has ALWAYS been great. You're just all about the hate.
@CNN , @BarackObama ; Well said..., Well said!
@BarackObama You should be ashamed of yourself & everyone who used that traitors services for your own political grandstanding! Where the hell is the remorse? That's right it's all fake cuz you all hated the traitor too! Bunch of fake asses & grandstanding. Sick POSs all of yas.
I am stunned that @MeghanMcCain @43georgebush , and @BarackObama used @JohnMcCain 's eulogy service to make jabs at our current presidential administration. #disrespectful #Disgraceful
America was at its lowest point when you became President @BarackObama and thank God, we have @realDonaldTrump to correct all your misdeeds. Donald Trump is making America great again @MeghanMcCain #MAGA #Trump2020
If we can't get @BarackObama back, can we at least get Jed Bartlet?
@TheRealStanLee You were quoted by @BarackObama in his eulogy to John McCain, saying that both of them believed that, ..."with great power and blessings, come great responsibility. "
It was this morning when @BarackObama spoke at @SenJohnMcCain memorial service ! pic.twitter.com/B7rMx4DB3s
Thank you @barackobama for a beautiful eulogy for @SenJohnMcCain . You still got it (and we miss you).
@foxnewspolitics we tried everything in our power to give the mccains respect and civility in their sad times. Now with the hate filled eulogies that were spit into our faces. Those times up @Bush41Library @BarackObama @MeghanMcCain you will be able to console each other 11-6-18

@BarackObama is a disgrace
President @BarackObama used this quote TWICE during the eulogy of McCain. Food for much thought. pic.twitter.com/Mcxb7sf4yX
@BarackObama thank you...enough said
He was a war criminal & corrupt as Hell. He is responsible, along with @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton for forming & arming DAESH i.e. ISIS. He is complicit in all their atrocities! Soon the rest of them will join him in Hell. G-d is not mocked! You will reap what you sow!
My takeaway from #JohnMcCain funeral: What kind of nation do we want to be? One of racism & hate or inclusion and love? I know what I want: the kind expressed by @MeghanMcCain & @BarackObama .
@BarackObama is just doing this for his base that follows him off of a cliff. #DNCFraudlawsuitSept25
@BarackObama thank you... enough said
Thank you @BarackObama and @TheBushCenter for showing the world what who we really are. RIP @SenJohnMcCain #riseabovehate
I miss that eloquence and dignity of @BarackObama . @realDonaldTrump has debased society and we must find a way to rise above the cesspool he works so hard to create.

@BarackObama ran for @POTUS TWO times and WON! Some racists will never recover from that. #SorryNotSorry Yes, #MAGA
If @BarackObama had an ounce of credibility he would not have attended the funeral of the right wing racist war monger that was McCain! But we all know Obama loved his wars too. Both scum. Break free from the war machine! @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @DNC
Sorry Ron you clearly have no understanding of @BarackObama who did a very fine job at exactly what you are projecting...!

@BarackObama please campaign for @BetoORourke and @AndrewGillum and any other Democrat you can fit in your schedule. Your eulogy was beautiful today. You are missed.
Did you see @BarackObama speech ? Now that's what a real @POTUS sounds like.

@BarackObama how are Michelle and the girls adjusting outside the bubble? I don't hear much about the family any more. Thanks for the kind words at John McCains service. Your class is always appreciated in this time of classless and clueless. Miss you in the Whitehouse.
How? By bringing back John McCain. Or @BarackObama ? #RealPatriots know that you and @RodneyDavis are self-serving, and that IS all. #Sad
Love this! @MichelleObama @BarackObama @43georgebush

How do we go from the grace of @billclinton & @HillaryClinton honoring Aretha, then George Bush & @BarackObama honoring #McCainMemorial back to the disgrace of Trump & his supporters.
To @BarackObama @MeghanMcCain @GeorgeWBush Fuck you, fuck you & fuck you 2! Using a funeral 2 attack @POTUS is a low blow & shows your political sliminess A socialist nitwit who hides ALL his records, a turncoat daughter w/ half a brain & a silver spoon idiot rino #MAGA
@BarackObama Your words today for John McCain, an extraordinary American, were beautiful, eloquent and inspiring. How I miss soulful statesmanship and a president of the caliber described today.
@BarackObama ~ You're SOOO JEALOUS of @realDonaldTrump he was all you could talk about today! You people made the whole occasion about Pres Trump & not about #McCainMemorial ~Hilarious. You people are OBSESSED w/ #MyPresident You buried the #DeepState and you shoot like a girl. pic.twitter.com/g5avQ82NPc
It must kill you how respected real men of service are. @SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama @JoeBiden just to name a few. You will never reach their level of integrity and honor. You are a sham.
Gives you an idea how hateful these low lives are. I'm sure they will all meet him again in hell. @MeghanMcCain @cindymccain @BarackObama @BillClinton @HillaryClinton
@BarackObama Your recent support for The South African regime, means you support white genocide
@LannyDavis , why worry about what he is doing? John McCain was lauded by @BarackObama and @JoeBiden for his #optimism . Lanny, tell us what makes you #optimistic . What is your case for #optimism ? Fight back with your optimism!
Today while @BarackObama Gave his eulogy at McCain's funeral I was reminded of a time when a President gave the world hope, belief, faith, empathy, and humanity. I really miss that... #TrumpIsAMoron #TrumpIsTheEnemyOfThePeople

Am I the only one who listens to sad breakup songs about missing someone and thinks of @BarackObama ?
I'm still basking in the glow of President @BarackObama 's words today. More please! Louder and oftener! The aura & energy of one who can offset, be an antidote to, the dreaded image and toxic blurtings of the demon gone mad, that we're subected to every day is sorely needed!
Sadly, this is not true. @SenJohnMcCain let us down big time, and it was NOT great, @MeghanMcCain when @BarackObama was ushered into our nation's inner sanctum. This is why we fought back to take this nation back. And I expect @realDonaldTrump and the voters will CONTINUE.
Your follower @BarackObama must be proud!

Sorry to disappoint but @BarackObama @BillClinton all ran the first time and won so getting over @realDonaldTrump winning is no big deal especially when we can make him a one term President who is impeached #suckonthat #americaisalreadygreat

Maybe he, @BarackObama should try Africa or Russia for that praise.
Nobody listens to you. But we ALL listened to @BarackObama
President @BarackObama speaks at his friends #JohnMCain funeral and gives a state of the art eulogy. Class is in session on how to be Presidential and speak about the country and how you honor a true AmericanHero. Take your politics out of it and watch https:// youtu.be/oIBgQrXKC8k

Hey #resist bots, @barackobama make up your minds. Cuomo says America was never great, now you say it's always been great. Get your stories straight! Fact is America was always great until 24 yrs of Clinton, RINO Bush and traitor Obama. #MAGA https:// fxn.ws/2wB4jrP #FoxNews
