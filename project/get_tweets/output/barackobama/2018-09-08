How many billions did you waste under your fearless @BarackObama investing in your friends BS companies with no plan that took taxpayer money and failed? Renewable if planned and executed could be a viable SUPPLEMENT maybe
@BarackObama reminds you of a 4 yr old that insists he is going to be your president. The 4 yr old gets out his tonka truck & hollers vroom vroom & crashes it and says this is how you drive Americans.

It's ironic and silly that @BarackObama and the Democrats criticize @POTUS for not following precedent while Obama doesn't follow it by shutting up and letting @realDonaldTrump alone, like President Bush did for Obama. Also, Obama wants to go backwards, not forward like Trump
Absolutely awesome. #Bongino is dead on here. Thank you! @DanBongino Rips @BarackObama for Blasting @POTUS in Speech https:// youtu.be/uLMMNAAct2c via @YouTube
You still have A lot of work. Undoing @BarackObama Ain't easy. Rock On Don! #MAGA #USA
@BarackObama do you still not get it? No one wants to hear the same old crap speeches that cost hillary the election. If the American people still wanted all the failed policies of yours last election Hillary would have won. So you and your tranny wife take a hike! #MAGA #winning
@BarackObama You were on the same stage as Farrakhan. You total hypocrite. You are pathetic.
Should have asked @BarackObama to end that policy when he was there... why now do u have a problem with it?
I love how liberals like @BarackObama behave and talk like there is no YouTube

Can somebody ask B. Obama how exactly his policies helped the economy reach where it is 2 years after he left, when most of his policies were done away with? Asking for a friend " @BarackObama
Difference between @POTUS and @BarackObama , Trump became president with money and his love for Americans. Obama became rich using the office of POTUS, that's all.
@BarackObama you sold us out, man. Are you THAT racist? Do you have that much white guilt in you that you would damn your mother's people? I voted for you... and you let me down.
Former President @BarackObama taking the stage in Anaheim today to the glow of hundreds of camera phones. #44 stumping for Democratic challengers to key house seats in #CA . No direct shots at @realDonaldTrump this time. Just the steady drumbeat of support. #Midterms @NBCNews pic.twitter.com/AnSzZBHBcm
@BarackObama You call Trump, in not very subtle terms, a liar. BUT YOUR WHOLE PRESIDENCY WAS ONE GIGANTIC LIE. This is because your activists indoctrinated the whole country into Political Correctness. This means everyone lives a life of lies, saying things to fit your..
You want to say @HillaryClinton was the wrong choice you will get no argument here. If you want say @BarackObama is late with it, yup. But the Republicans were united against him and her the moment they got put on and they made a pack with the devil they can't back out of.
Good thing . @realDonaldTrump is . @POTUS bc . @BarackObama would have given Kapernick him one of those fancy, great American medals!
America loves @BarackObama . Keep trying failed presidential candidate Marco Rubio.
It's amazing as you hear all the top business people at DAVOS talking about how much @POTUS has make a difference in comparison to @BarackObama and even though we had the worst Hurricanes that destroyed much of our country - Islands & States Florida, Texas plus California fires.
trouble of it is @BarackObama wasn't an enemy with these INhumans, he & they were allies!

I know I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this, but I'm prepared. I wanna hear what everyone has to say without any pettiness ... @BarackObama is a pathetic excuse of a U.S. President bitching about @realDonaldTrump successes while trying to take credit. #ChangeMyMind

Did you see @BarackObama speak today? He said he wanted to reach out to Republicans and Independents. And he said Medicare For All is a new idea. Hopefully, he doesn't read any history books on Johnson, Truman, FDR...to learn that this was the Democratic platform before Clinton

I Miss @BarackObama . Even Though, He Has Flaws But Obama Is One Of My Favorite Presidents All Time With The Likes Of JFK, Bill Clinton and Lincoln.
Wouldn't do any good; . @BarackObama listens only to himself. Neither history nor any mere mortal can compete with that alter ego.
@BarackObama @SenSanders @VanJones68 @sikorskiradek @janrostowski Why don't you meet and talk about it? Pls have in mind that in spite of the fact that Poland was a communist country it never reached level of Venezuela. Toilet paper was a luxury though /2
Thanks @BarackObama for the economic gains your administration worked hard to achieve. Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump degraded our economic recovery with his massive Con tax cuts for the wealthy, wage stagnation, and high inflation-especially seen in basics like groceries.
@BarackObama . What can you expect from a Muslim President?

@BarackObama Some legacy Great job @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/bxgAerlpRT

@BarackObama has stopped being a state man & has also called the state of or union what it is. We all must take it not only to the streets but to the polling places with our votes. This is a call to Arms America. Let's Do This for ourselves and future for our children #Resist
@BarackObama has 102 million followers, dotard has 54 million. But, but, 50% of his are Russian trolls, and 25% are Dems only there to watch the freak show. Sooooo..... Go ahead & try to do the math MAGAts.
@BarackObama ifif, the biggest con artist to have taken the white house. From rag to riches on the back of the people. He left behind, a divided country, high unemployment, healthcare cost through the roof, 10 trillion in debt, and he thinks we want more #MAGA @realDonaldTrump

I remember when this RECOVERY started - after January 20th, 2017 when our new (real) President took office. You, @BarackObama , never believed he had the "magic wand" to do it, remember? Well, HE DID! Now, just *go away*. Please?!! You FRAUD. #Narcissist #FAIL
@BarackObama For G-d's sake stop lying. Have you no shame? No conspiracy.....Benghazi was you and Hillary
@BarackObama Fall seven times and subdued by success inspiration revenge #is ! #truthfully
Hey @BarackObama at least Trump will leave office as a Real American President.
@BarackObama It boggles my mind how Obama could deny ANY responsibility for his lousy actions during his 8 yrs (blamed Bush constantly), yet claims responsibility during DJT's helm. Not exactly sure how that works, Barack...
@BarackObama your title should say former president, not president.
@BarackObama we rejected your lame leadership, your atrocious foreign policy, and your dismantling of our military. You took our country down a terrible path. Shut the hell up!
HEY @BarackObama maybe you can learn something from this great AMERICAN PATRIOTS all the same colors. RED WHITE AND BLUE!
Each day a new Trump-induced trauma An endless news cycle of drama Sometimes I cry, But mostly I sigh, And wish we had @BarackObama
Nope. I would say @BarackObama is in the top 1 when it comes to #Fraud . #BoycottDemocrats the party of #Intolerance #Hate #Division #Racism #Rioting #Violence
This is disgusting. A respectable former president stays out of politics during the next president's term. We watched him pat himself on the back and blame GWB for 8 years, and he is still not done. Go away @BarackObama . Go to your vacation home and shut up.
Remembering @BarackObama telling us all how qualified @HillaryClinton was he however forgot to mention the expertise she had was weaponizing bought and paid for information against a Presidential candidate #WalkAway #BuildTheWall #AmericaFirst #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp #Trump2020
I second that motion, hit the bricks @BarackObama
Good heavens. @barackobama 's every take on every issue was from the perspective of racial resentment. That why we had police assassinated in the streets of major cities, why we had a President endorse the "hands up, don't shoot" lie. A thug shot in self-defense was a racist act.
Just watched a show with @KatiePavlich and @RealCandaceO ... @BarackObama wants more women in politics...here they are. Amazing insight and perspectives.
GWB and @BarackObama are both cut from the same deep state cloth.
Thought of the day. Why on earth is it ok to go around the country and lie every time you open your mouth? @BarackObama @HillaryClinton where are your morals.
@BarackObama "how is donald going to fix the economy and bring back jobs? does he have a magic wand?" no you economical illiterate, he has WORKED his entire life and understands business, something you HATE... 8 yrs of bs failings and within 9 months BOOMING economy...

. @BarackObama , people don't vote because they don't find leaders they want to support, who fighting for them. Parties ignored the youth & groomed, promoted candidates who fit into the status quo. The solution is not to pressure the voters rather to push for new leadership.
You go CJ...awesome words!! @BarackObama listen to this young man...he knows more than you do and speaks eloquently for us deplorables!! Enough said!!

Why does it feel so comforting to know that President @BarackObama is back? He's making inspirational speeches, & I have missed him so much.
I love when @BarackObama pauses between phrases in his speeches, because he's really thinking about the impact and power his words have.
Alright . @KrisParonto , don't ever let the SOB, . @BarackObama , or the country forget the lies he & HRC told to CYA.
https:// youtu.be/NCA-Mm19fH8 I completely agree with @BarackObama . We need to #vote this November. We lost the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, because there was less than 40% in those #elections . When people turnout @TheDemocrats win. We need a check on @realDonaldTrump . #Dems

Trump hates Obama because Trump can never be the man that Obama is. Obama built his following with love. Trump is full of envy and greed because he cannot fill himself up with love. I miss @BarackObama , his intellect and humor, and most of all, his grace.
@BarackObama is the one guy who can knock Trump off the news cycle. Which of course pisses off Trump to no end! Vote in November!
Can we elect @BarackObama as our next President?
Really ? I think @BarackObama will be doing a few more speeches before November 6th so they got their work cut out for them. No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride. HST
