@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1 campaigned on #ruleoflaw & it will be upheld. The @BarackObama fraud is #FANNIEGATE
Not increasing as much as Obama deficit and natl debt. Money would not need to be spent today if Obama had not given hundreds of billions to our enemies. @BarackObama @POTUS @GOP @VP @WhiteHouse @RncRepublican
@POTUS how does it feel to know over 1/2 the country likes @BarackObama way more than you? @StephenAtHome @Trevornoah @maddow
Just wondering why @BarackObama dont take credits for this...

@BarackObama @HillaryClinton @AmbassadorRice You all lied to America and to the grieving families who lost their loved ones during #Benghazi . A mistake of which can never be undone. We will always remember until justice is finally given for the families. And for America.
Has @BarackObama or @HillaryClinton owned up to the horror they perpetuated in #Benghazi ?

@BarackObama I would like to share with you a book my beloved mother just published on growing up during the Algerian Revolution, terrorism and migrating our family to the United States to seek freedom. http:// bit.ly/Whereisfreedom
@BarackObama
And, @BarackObama did without giving a 1.5 trillion tax cut first.

Perhaps you'd care to share what @BarackObama did as POTUS to address this issue in Chicago.
We reject @BarackObama 's words in Chicago, "We lurched from eras of great Progressive change to periods of retrenchment." We denounce your "Marxist-Stalinist" agenda, period.
. @BarackObama So, the economy skyrockets after @POTUS gets rid of your failed programs, and you have the gall to claim the revival? You're a failed pos... Get in the corner and shut up... Narcissist....
@BarackObama
You aren't good enough to lick @BarackObama 's shoes.
@mike_pence @POTUS @BarackObama @MichelleObama @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @ChelseaClinton @Trevornoah @donlemon
look and learn @BarackObama how it's done
Yes! Benghazi is another @BarackObama @HillaryClinton deep state secret. We deserve to hear the TRUTH, not their standard BS. Why was the ambassador targeted? Why were special ops told to stand down?
"I know there are Republicans who believe government should only perform a few minimal functions but that one of those functions should be making sure nearly 3,000 Americans don't die in a hurricane and its aftermath." @BarackObama <- what he said!!!!
https:// youtu.be/I4TVAIsdJiA @BarackObama @CNN @abcnews @maddow you people have been protecting an illegal alien,Marxist communist that strived to destroy our Country,
Why didn't @BarackObama and Hillary Clinton send reinforcements to Benghazi?
This is the way you are supposed to respond. Thank you @BarackObama for reminding us how a real President is supposed to respond at a time like this.

@USCIS @BarackObama made this mess. @POTUS is cleaning it up! Keep it up P. @realDonaldTrump . deport all of these fake techies, doctor's coming from india. @ICEgov @SushmaSwaraj @narendramodi @timesofindia @76ersGC
@BarackObama did nothing for the economy. All those shovel ready jobs never happened. All those green jobs never materialized. The GDP never got over 3%. He was Malaise Man. Cash for clunkers and gender neutral bathrooms are his only legacies.
@BarackObama I think Obama is confused too..he thinks most Americans are stupid&will buy his line of bullshit..NOT happening any more,"we" Americans are so happy that @potus had a magic wand! Couldn't make a better campaign ad for Repub.,they continue to make fools of themselves!
Before this day ends I must say, I am grateful for @BarackObama for his leadership and unwavering persistence in ensuring the world was rid of the evil that perpetrated the carnage and human loss on that awful day in September 2001. pic.twitter.com/LA6pmeYTDy

If it was @BarackObama , he would have had a more inspiring tweet. @realDonaldTrump , if you have nothing useful to say, please stay off Twitter. Nobody will miss you
@MichelleObama @BarackObama who is @realDonaldTrump , #whoistrump #MakeAmericaLitAgain
Quite the opposite on #Crimea . He has noted that a referendum was held, true, and they voted to join #Russia , also true. This occurred just after @BarackObama , at least verbally, supported a violent coup of #yanukovich in support of his #EU overlords.
Same guys that paid for @BarackObama to go to Harvard
@realDonaldTrump I really hate you @HillaryClinton @BarackObama Thank you To all the first responders Thank you And to all those who passed away on this day 17 years ago, I hope you are resting in peace #NeverForget

No disrespect meant to you @BarackObama but it did change me and a lot of other people I know.
That looks like the biggest crowd that a 9/11 Memorial has ever seen. So bigly. So yuge. Way bigger than @BarackObama when he visited.
@BarackObama je t'aime
No doubt the press has something to do with that. The reality is that we conservatives accepted @BarackObama as our president. We didn't like it, never did! But the liberals went to the streets shouting; "he's not my president." Then the press targeted Trump. Plan B in effect
@ArtifactionGG @BarackObama With cooperation, communication and coordination we can make it happen! #Cardsmith pic.twitter.com/yaDeXhi2Tm
All Trump does is win. That's respect. But its EARNED. He doesn't just talk out of his ass like @BarackObama . @POTUS is a man of ACTION.
@BarackObama You have been the worst president of the USA, particularly I think you are a depraved by allowing the marriage homoxesual. By allowing and not attacking Communism in Venezuela. Shame should give you, for attacking President Trump
@BarackObama So what do you and your brothers, Islamic Terrorists have planned today?

Scrolling through my twitter feed and found these two tweets, which highlight the difference between @realDonaldTrump and @BarackObama perfectly. #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/GpTD0g8QJ1
2500 of them @BarackObama gave permanent residence.
Yes, let us never forget the 4 dead Americans from 9/11/12 whose caskets @HillaryClinton stood in front of and lied to the world about their deaths to protect the political careers of her and @BarackObama . Why don't we talk about those 4 @atrupar -something that needs no context?
@realDonaldTrump This is the face of a buffoon who just won 20 bucks on a scratch off game, not a President whose supposed to be honoring the victims of 9/11. Barack will always beat you, at EVERYTHING. @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/0KJb1zp2VK
Sebastian, I want to know when @realDonaldTrump is going to FORCE @BarackObama TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF A GRAND JURY !
See how many times the cheater in chief at @google went to collude with the @BarackObama White House. 200 times plus.
No.. @BarackObama made this economy to what it is, he is the true president here. Your father is ridding his coattails.
Thank you for your service, Kris. I cannot imagine for a second what you went through. We also appreciate you calling @BarackObama out for his peddling of lies. Lies they created on their own and jailed someone for.
You're very welcome Mike. Glad I can be of service to you! Thankful I served under #PresidentReagan ! I feel sorry for people who had to serve under that LIAR @BarackObama #ObamaLies
Its true!!!!! State to State, Depts with started changing policy and started to apply more accountability across the board from the State all the way down to Employees & Unemployed, including folks on state/federal programs! Since the mid 90's @BarackObama just improved it! A+
@SallyQYates @Comey @petestrzok @BarackObama You tried to overrule the American People by framing @GenFlynn and concocting this fraudulent story about Russian conspiracy to overthrow our duly elected POTUS! I BELIEVE YOU HAVE COMMITTED TREASON AGAINST AMERICA! #Gitmo4Traitors
To humour a deranged incredulous fool is to aid in his influence and grant him authority over that which he seeks to destroy. #Trump is the Inspector Cluzo of Presidents.

@BarackObama Mr Obama. Why aren't the American people allowed to view our advanced technology hidden from us at places like Groom Lake? The TR-3B/Aurora Triangular craft for example. Not all sightings can be fakes. Some of us would love to be a part of it.

How did the always respectful gentleman @BarackObama hold his tongue and not tell @SenateMajLdr to F OFF?
My Daughter does not know him, and she's 25. Stick with @BarackObama
The great Coward-in-Chief @BarackObama made that statement, then spent eight years apologizing for American 'aggression', and a host of other things. He bowed, scraped, and took the floor to demean the US at every chance. History will not be kind to the Piece of crap.
Thank you @BarackObama for your responsible fiscal policies as they built a solid foundation.

America's public investments fell from a high of 3.6% of GDP in 1965 + 1966 to an average of 2.5% of GDP during 3 decades of Reaganomics. After @BarackObama boosted spending, @realDonaldTrump dropped the ball. It's nearing historic lows again as #USA is falling apart. pic.twitter.com/tAbH7Efc7i
