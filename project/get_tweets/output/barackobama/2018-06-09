I wonder if @BarackObama will consider running again.
Kim Jong Un & Trump r more likely to have chemistry bcuz being so much alike. Unlike leaders in G7 who r more like @BarackObama which is why Trump is so bitter to them. Jong Un & Putin know they can punk @POTUS ! @MalcolmNance @CNNSotu @amjoyshow @nytimes pic.twitter.com/qyRZTeWPgi

@BarackObama is the best modern day President in most of our lifetimes! @realDonaldTrump is the WORST! I refer to Trump as the Alien Prez!
@realDonaldTrump I wonder how often @JustinTrudeau talks w/ @BarackObama ... our allies who are respected world leaders know that America no longer has a leader in the WH It has become clear to everyone that Trump represents Putin/Russia NOT the USA Time for him to go #TeamMueller
@BarackObama you forgot to add criminal and loser to your profile, you fucking terrorist.
DJT might mistakenly think the auto bailout was a @BarackObama initiative. But it was launched by Bush 43, and without his help, Chrysler easily would have been lost, if not GM, too.

And again, I have to ask - Where is BHO?? He should be out defending or explaining himself and his traitorous actions against our USA! Treason should be the least of the charges against him and the others up to their neck in crimes. @BarackObama @HillaryClinton

. @BarackObama It is becoming very clear that Trump is serving RUSSIA instead of America. When do we start the impeachment process? America is growing tired of the lies and now the open COLLUSION in plain site! Trump must be held accountable NOW! Enough is Enough!
So will healthcare costs increase more then the 250% under @BarackObama and the unaffordable healthcare act???
Yeah, dude, you won 2 elections. Props. But in just 16 months President Trump has thankfully erased your miserable existence from history. So...you lost! You, @BarackObama are a historical footnote. Like the bubonic plague.

Tonight's CNN's Parts Unknown episode at 8:00 is @Bourdain episode in Hanoi with @BarackObama . Will be watching again, with equal measures of sadness and gratitude for these two leaders.
I said it before our nation elected him, he has all the calling cards of a dictator. He has completely undone all of the good bridge building @BarackObama did with the international community and set us back decades. We MUST vote this guy out when his term is up. #Resist
You are right @BarackObama was best president ever.
Clearly. Time to lock @BarackObama up
Well we can remind him every day that @BarackObama has twice as many Twitter followers than @realDonaldTrump does as the current President.

Obama did an 8 year tour of apologies! Not one question like this ever arose from the Uranium one scandal! In Fact the Media is part of the coverup of the Uranium one deal! Hard Ball questions are never for demoncrats just Trump! I would like to see a reporter ask @BarackObama
@JustinTrudeau sorry that our Pres well...just sorry. We respect and admire you and thank you for being our peaceful neighbor and ally. There is nothing that cannot be worked out peacefully. We miss Pres Obama very much @BarackObama
Jealous the manboy Mac daddy @BarackObama got laughed at & rolled?
Suicide has risen in EVERY American state. Depression & anxiety is an illness that MANY suffer from. Trump...in his quest & NEED to destroy EVERYTHING President @BarackObama did, wants to end coverage of pre- exsisting conditions. Explain that to those with depression & anxiety.

Putin made @BarackObama look bad time and again. That makes you libs crazy, we get it. Should we get into another cold war over it? I dont think so. @POTUS is trying to bring Russia back into the fold of nations. We have used the stick, maybe time for carrot?
For all those who insisted Obama was an "imperial president," a "tyrant," "authoritative," and so much worse,...F-you! Never once, not a single time, did @BarackObama overstep the normal authority of a @potus . His EOs & power plays were w/in bounds. Trump's are not & he must go.

Keep that narrative going Axe. It stings when @realDonaldTrump is right, doesn't it? Crimea was 100% on @BarackObama Just another on a long list of things Trump wouldn't have to worry about it Barry would've DONE HIS JOB.
@JustinTrudeau wasn't the one lying, Trump. It was you. You're a vile, despised and ill-suited, sexual predator, unlike real leaders, such as President @BarackObama , PM Trudeau, and @AngelaMerkeICDU . They should kick YOU out of the G6, just as we intend to, when Mueller is done.

That was Obama's "more flexibility" and you Adam Schiff didn't ask @BarackObama why he was a Putin Puppet.

When @BarackObama was elected president in 2008, he had to clean up in US relations with the outside world. He spent time building personal relationships with other heads of state. He rebuilt the trust of the inhabitants of allied countries. @POTUS did not take much time.....

WOW I'm American and @BarackObama couldn't even give me one million, instead he gave it to terrorists. What a tyrant and criminal. BE GONE
@HillaryClinton and @BarackObama . The biggest bullies to other counties! To get them to fall in line! When are other countries going to say No to the USA! THEY DESTROY COUNTRIERS FOR OIL POPPY SEEDS! WE CREATED #ISIS When will it End???!!!
WOW MSNBC YOU ALL know DAM WELL it WAS @BarackObama & THE DEMOCRATS THAT ESTABLISHED THAT LAW and #POTUS45 has to follow the LAW. So STOP BLAMING TRUMP FOR WHAT YOUR MESIAH OBAMA CREATED. #FakeNews #liar is all MSNBC does.
@BarackObama
And when did it all start Sharon? America digressed as a patriotic nation under the watchful eye of @BarackObama . We had our issues B4 him, but he took us back 2 the 60s. He promised 2 fundamentally change America & that he did. He pitted everyone against everyone. We need God!

When I think of how D. Trump has made his presidency about Obama, honestly I can't help but be convinced he's a shameless racist. Am looking forward to see Obama shred him come next campaign season! @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @DNC @GOP @wapo @nytimes @cnntoday @WhiteHouse RT
Maybe if you and the rest of the media would respect the transfer of power. @BarackObama ruined this country spilling division and creating the negative polarization, he is a total p.o.s
Like a ballot, it doesn't count. Entire populations will be unrepresented. Tax $ & all gov services will be redistributed for 10+ years. This untested question, will be devastating. The census must be challenged in the courts NOW. Can @ACLU help? @BarackObama @PreetBharara
@BarackObama HELP!
Care to comment, @BarackObama ? @ValerieJarrett ? If you were still in power, how much MORE cash would you be sending #Iran ?
@SenFeinstein why didnt you and your so called 38 take a stand when @BarackObama was doing this ? Yeah maybe this is repercussions ecause you actually have to work now! Remember the good ol days when these kids didnt matter to you pic.twitter.com/nPREp4uuTA
YOU were NOT concerned about that when @BarackObama @HillaryClinton were toppling Lybia or trying to fix Israeli and Iraqi elections. Hmmm .... @JohnJHarwood is a loon
We stand humbly on the shoulders of giants - our families, our mentors, our teams - whose sacrifices have made our work possible. Thank you @BarackObama & @MichelleObama for the guidance you offered & for welcoming us into the @ObamaFoundation family. #ObamaFellows @mercy_health pic.twitter.com/UCLkCIPS9g

@BarackObama I, along with so many other Americans, sincerely HOPE that you will respond to Trump's comments at the G-7 Summit in which he blames you for Russia invading Crimea. His comments were outrageous!!!
Survived the Dubya era with Comedy Central, @KeithOlbermann , #JonStewart , &@StephenAtHome. Thrilled to b the @BarackObama years but frustrated over @GOP obstruction. Hopeful for a @HillaryClinton presidency. 2/

Absolutely. He is a sociopath, devoid of any conscience or empathy. And like so many things, we can thank @BarackObama for elevating and rewarding him when he was his chief deportation officer as head of ERO. pic.twitter.com/DGTZhmLodQ
Economy sucked under Obama. @realDonaldTrump reverses BHO's policies. Economy thrives. Liberal media credits... @BarackObama . Sure.

But we also knew he was way better and wanted America to win. Miss @BarackObama apology tours? Me neither.
@Eagles didn't get invited to the White House by Trump. But hey maybe @BarackObama will invite them to Ramadan party.
It is also the vindictiveness and pathological loathing he has for the legacy of @BarackObama
