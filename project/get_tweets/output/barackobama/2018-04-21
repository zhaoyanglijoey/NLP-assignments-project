He had to go cause he knew President @BarackObama was going. Lmao. I would have emphatically told @realDonaldTrump to stay away.
Dude, I hope you were referring to @BarackObama
@VanJones68 what I like to see asked during your carpool are: What was wrong w/ @BarackObama ? What was wrong w/ @HillaryClinton ? What is wrong w/Trump? What do they think about the #birtherism , #Pizzagate or #SethRich ? Corruption? Any proof? Where did they here this? #VanJonesShow
This man is more like the thinking of Banana Republic countries. @BernieSanders would fit right in with their government. So many Jewish people have no clue how hurtful & dangerous these liberals are. They make deals w/ Iran & reward Cuba - @BarackObama did just that. 2/2
as far as the old question "why hasn't he put on a show for us,we paid" now we know they answer. Saying I was under mai I don't think so. I don't walk or work for no one! How many things like cars/cc's has this card paid for?meatwad/nick persons want to know @BarackObama
@BarackObama did show his birth certificate. Where is @realDonaldTrump 's? Hell just his tax returns showing no collusion.
Thank you @BarackObama , you are a kind and caring man. A true gentleman. Rest In Peace Barbara Bush #barbarabushfuneral pic.twitter.com/ibZLJ4Hv9F

@BarackObama Thanks 2 UR legacy, MS13 is running rampant in the land. Ppl R dying, cops R being threatened. THIS is ur ONLY legacy, dude.
I would put a bet on @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS getting a divorce long before the best President and First Lady in history @BarackObama and @MichelleObama ever will
I think @FLOTUS likes @BarackObama
I love the way donald drumpf destroys what little is left of the GOP, after @BarackObama decimated it. Go drumpf! Pee on Mitch and Ryan, they want it. - very very very very very very very baaaaaaadly ....sad
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump had a good time playing golf today while @FLOTUS enjoyed the company of @BarackObama at the funeral of #BarbaraBush .
Peace is possible if people of Israel and Palestine embrace each others as loving human beings while firing the current greedy and ineffective leadership! @BarackObama @VanJones68 @UN @TIME @CNN

You are not going to find that one person. Everything @realDonaldTrump has done thus far has been to undo what @BarackObama accomplished.
And still doing better for The United States of America and The World than @BarackObama did in EIGHT (8) years. God bless @realDonaldTrump , America and our allies. pic.twitter.com/UMNulyMwaU
How can you not be happy around @BarackObama and @MichelleObama with Barack being so damn smart and sexy!!
This is who @BarackObama is at his core. He ignores the rantings of that petulant child in the White House.

@FLOTUS looks genuinely happy in the company of @BarackObama . Total 180 from how she looks at the company of CORRUPT @realDonaldTrump
That's the problem @realDonaldTrump is such a small ignorant little man Like Republicans didn't hate @BarackObama they even told America he wasn't born in the US but he invited his enemies Trump is supposed to represent all Mexicans Blacks Puerto Ricans & Democrats
@BarackObama being so nice to the wife of a man who has insulted him for more than 6 years & who joined her husband's birtherism & @MichelleObama being ok with him doing this reminds me so much of what I miss: Decency, Compassion, Leadership, A President.

You know who never had a guilty conscious or persona? @BarackObama . your polar opposite
I hope she thinks about the generosity @BarackObama is extending to her in this moment and is deeply shamed by her past Birtherism.
@BarackObama being Black is NOT a problem. Obama being the wrong Black president set Blacks back years. We need a woman in the White House. I didn't vote for @HillaryClinton not because she's a woman, but because of her history of corruption. She would have been the wrong woman
I've never seen her smile like that near @realDonaldTrump . I bet the size of @BarackObama inauguration impressed @FLOTUS pic.twitter.com/krAVrxDbRN

@BarackObama is a race-baiter, set race relations back decades, encouraged lawlessness, supported criminals, gave millions to a country that supports terrorism, failed our men in Benghazi. If he'd been white he would have been just as much a failure as an American.

@BarackObama is a Good man !!!
Laughing with @BarackObama . This should send the Trumpians into a slobbering fit.
To loosely quote @goldengateblond - @BarackObama makes Melania happier at a funeral then @realDonaldTrump does every single day.

Which proves that @BarackObama is one of the most graceful and classy dudes ever.
So you think being cognizant of over 25 million people in slavery today is ignorant? If you think Shirley Chisholm is irrelevant now, then think again. She made such huge strides for Blacks & others in this country that she set a stage where @BarackObama could run.

@MelaniaTrump NEVER smiles when she's with @RealDonaldTrump . But sitting beside @BarackObama even at a solemn event like a funeral brings a warm smile to her face. @CNN @MSNBC @NYTimes @WashingtonPost @ABC @CBS pic.twitter.com/6Tv7vCTVOi
I wish I was half the man @BarackObama is..
SUPPPPPPP- @BarackObama - allegedly
I just read an article in @TIME which is likely considered #fakenews . It mentions how Scott Pruitt is reversing a lot of @BarackObama EPA regulations. Hopefully everyone can just do the right thing: pick up trash, recycle what you can, anything will help #EarthDay #everyday

Because @BarackObama is a kind and gracious man.#44
@FLOTUS follows 5 on Twitter. 1 is @BarackObama
@BarackObama actually has VERY BIG hands & is good at playing basketball because he's young, handsome, athletic, and really smart! pic.twitter.com/MNwovexaaN
How could you not smile, when you're in the presence of an angel that walks among us ~ POTUS44 @BarackObama
@JoeBiden can run as President, and @MichelleObama (or @BarackObama ) can run as vice president. There's your 8 more years. Make history. Think outside the box.

More of Trump's tweets about President Obama. Again, thank you @BarackObama for showing such grace and dignity today at the #BarbaraBushFuneral We were not surprised. We miss you. pic.twitter.com/ZqzRGZXB2Z

Missing #BarackObama as I start to listen to the podcast "Making Obama." It's really good. @BarackObama @WBEZ Don't ever forget what Barack taught us (as did #DeloresHuerta and #CesarChavez before him): Yes we can!
I wonder how @FLOTUS feels, not only sitting next to gracious @BarackObama and @MichelleObama , but also @BillClinton and my Pres. @HillaryClinton after smarmy @realDonaldTrump paraded Pres. Clinton's accusers. Karma has to feel like too-tight pantyhose crawling up her ass!!

They primary focus is great, but I also enjoy the attitudes of @MichelleObama , @BillClinton , and @HillaryClinton in relation to @BarackObama and each other. It's a somber occasion, but it's easy to imagine a mini-soap opera here.
@realDonaldTrump can't you act presidential for FIVE MINUTES? Just look at @BarackObama and how happy he makes your wife, and he's not even president anymore. You are an embarrassment. Just resign.
I want Rob Porter fired/removed permanently from state/fed gov for being grossly unfit @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @FBI @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @SenSchumer @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters
Another shout out to @BarackObama for his habitual slacking that allowed china to dominate the sc sea
On the left some of the unhinged, unkind, deplorable and delusional Trump tweets about a fine man, President Obama. On the right, the grace and decency in practice. Thank you @BarackObama for being you. pic.twitter.com/isc4vKv4qj
If there ever was an opportunity presented for @FLOTUS to stick it to her husband she just did. @BarackObama Trump's arch enemy. @POTUS chose to play golf & shrug his obligation as President which is a shameful embassenment for America. @WhiteHouse @nytimes @maddow @JoyAnnReid
Obviously Melania has NO SHAME. Look at who she married/had a baby with, ffs. On the other hand? Not much "HIGHER" can you go than both of the @BarackObama & @MichelleObama went today in that church pew.
Always respectful and dignified @BarackObama showed @FLOTUS what she rarely experiences ,,, Best thing @realDonaldTrump has done ....NOT SHOW UP and kept his mouth and FINGERS QUIET !!!!!
I can see the headlines! @FLOTUS , to move up her ranking to replace @MichelleObama To Go From Being Wife Number Three to Wife Number Two by Partnering Up @BarackObama ! And with that, she is also considering making a run at the #2020elections . Yeah, I can this playing out, nice
In @realDonaldTrump 's insanity-tweeting defense, he took one picture of his wife sizing him up against @BarackObama and lost his ( #StableGenius ) mind...
wrong twitter account. it's @BarackObama

Hope you are also seeing @FLOTUS sitting next to our most admired and respected president @BarackObama - this will only confirm more and more that Melanie has married an embarrassing idiot. Happy golfing
Well look at @BarackObama pardons!!
Ehh @realDonaldTrump it's been AWHILE since I've seen your wife smile, PUBLICLY... bruh EVERY black man knows THAT smile... don't think my boy ain't got the juice. He just got a better one ALREADY. #IsThatYaChick #WeCouldTakeHer @BarackObama - I got ya back pic.twitter.com/AldOVwjj0m
I wonder how she felt sitting next to a real #POTUS @BarackObama
Trumps done so much for America in such a short period of time that it almost makes me wonder what the hell that idiot @BarackObama was doing all those years
With @BarackObama no less.
You know @realDonaldTrump is seething knowing @BarackObama is charming the La Perla panties off of @FLOTUS . pic.twitter.com/4sGSKmnW0v
the memos are with Putin right next to the @BarackObama tapes
Why didn't @BarackObama , A Brother by Another Mother, why didn't he Pardon Johnson?
Would love to know what . @BarackObama told Melania Trump at Funeral Mass today - he was smiling and then she did too #curious
and she's sitting there smiling next to @BarackObama a REAL president.. not just that plays one on twitter..
I'm not an admirer of President @BarackObama . I dislike the man. However, his basic decency has never been an issue.
Find yourself someone who looks at you the way @MELANIATRUMP looks at @BarackObama
The look on Mrs Obama's face! Hold it in, Michelle! @BarackObama tell sis to hold it in! Romans 12:18 New International Version (NIV) 18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
Will @Starbucks give the policeman the same courtesy they're giving the black men? I hear they're giving them restitution by setting them up n their own business . I bet a police officer could use some of that action. That was the yr @BarackObama was hating on cops..figures
