The country needs you back @BarackObama to restore morals and compassion cause this looney is destroying everything you built.
Yes this is Crazy, I mean Obama using the #FISA system to spy on his enemies? Next thing you will say is that he used the #IRS to go after conservatives or spied on Israel for his #IranDeal or spied on reporters. There is no way you can say @BarackObama did these thingys!!!!
So glad your not in office anymore @BarackObama #worstpotusever
After watching the excellent interview of @BarackObama on @DavidLetternan 's new #Neflix show last night, it seemed like it has been 10 years, not 1! What gives...
@narendramodi @NYTimesCohen @paulkrugman @BarackObama i want to say 1 thing which u dont like : the foundation of usa was based on REASON BUT THE REASON WAS ROOTED IN JUSTICE AND THAT JUSTICE HAS ROOTS IN THAT BOOK CALLED THE BIBLE @BillClinton THATS MY BELIEF @HillaryClinton
@realDonaldTrump called #Africa a #Shithole & the #AfricanUnion outraged but @BarackObama invaded #Libya & bombed #Somalia repeatedly with drones but they are still silent. African Union representatives are the real #Shitholes @AU_PSD #Africa #Eritrea #Ethiopia #Sudan #Djibouti pic.twitter.com/F9bESa0nWd
Thanks Pres @BarackObama for our Economy Trump has done NOTHING except be a CORRUPT RACIST LYING TRAITOR who along with @GOP has SHUTDOWN the GOVT @housegop @senategop @vp cant wait to see them all voted out in 2018/2020
You mean like when the GOP blocked @BarackObama at every turn, including his supreme court nominee for a YEAR? The GOP refused to cooperate with Obama on anything at all. He held up the ACA a year trying to negotiate with GOP, when he should have pulled a #GOPTaxScam
Cover the names & it'd be impossible to guess which of these tweets were from former @BarackObama employees, and which one was from the head of @JohnKasich 's super PAC: pic.twitter.com/dp276kGV0j

@gop had one year to pull this together. They have full majority, I blame them. I remember for 8 yrs they blame @BarackObama as leader, so only one word sticks best, "Incompetence"
Sure. Then since the Dems had it and had @BarackObama for 8 years yet they did nothing for the illegals. You people have brought hate to a whole new level.
Soy realmente fan de @BarackObama es genial
Thank you President @BarackObama . Glad you saved the economy. The fraud in the WH now is trying to take credit but Americans know you are responsible for the great success.

Hey @realDonaldTrump , I heard that one time @BarackObama stopped his breath for 20 seconds while making a call in the Oval office. Can you beat Obama by holding your breath for a world-record 30 seconds? You can do it! Go ahead and 'win' it now! #TrumpsShutdown
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @BarackObama The American People will also not forget the wasted time and money you spent on false accusations , lies, bribes, corruption and fraud. You made a big mistake against us. Especially against @realDonaldTrump
The problem for the right is that @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama are not only exceptional, they are frequently the best. Hillary Clinton might have gotten accepted into Yale Law as a side effect of liberal policy, but that had nothing to with her graduating first among many. 18/
America loved president @BarackObama . Never once under investigation either! #tRumpian
@BarackObama It's all coming out now. You used dossier to get FISA order to spy on other party candidate. Get ready for Jail you Traitor POS
@BarackObama got SCORCHED by GOP .... he probably is not eager to jump back in the fray. Cant say I blame him. You always miss the thing you didn't appreciate when you had it!
@BarackObama come back
@WillieNelson will you come to California and tell my mother who I really am she loves you and has for a long time someone other than @BarackObama and his lying illuminati people will never tell her and we have property in the Ozarks do a concert for veterans

Hey, retard! Why Do you RANDOMLY CAPITALIZE words that don't need to be capitalized! And grade school kid can spell better than you, and The Black Man ( @BarackObama ) whose legacy you try to erase, was a better President. Period. And he twice had a larger inauguration audience.

Just watched @DavidLetternan My Next Guest Needs No Introduction on Netflix. First guest @BarackObama . Intelligent, entertaining and informative. As a Canadian, I highly recommend it. Enjoyed it.
Thank you @BarackObama for laying the groundwork for a successful 2018. Hopefully @realDonaldTrump won't be around much longer to screw it up. Happy New Year to all the Obamas. #Resist
Yep, thanks to @BarackObama ...not your treasonous a$$.
@BarackObama should/could have fixed immigration, criminal justice, infrastructure and education instead of trying to do health care
I remember when @BarackObama became president, I ran down the road screaming filled with joy
watching #DavidLetterman interview #BarackObama @BarackObama and i can honestly say i miss him as our president like what has our country come to now #DonaldTrump winning was a complete scam and a joke

@realDonaldTrump DACA must go or we will have more and more Illegal Immigrants using it every new year. @BarackObama over stepped his power by backing illegal immigrants over law abiding citizens

@BarackObama did a wonderful job at the White House,as our President, now its time for him to enjoy life.
Actually the numbers are in on the stock market and you can go to any investment site to see the numbers. Even after coming out of a shitty year @BarackObama S&P gained 35.3% in first year, while your numbers are a sad and small 23.6% gain in your first year! #biggestloser

@MickMulvaneyOMB What did you think about the 2013 shutdown when @BarackObama was President? I'll bet you didn't think that one was "cool". What's different; oh, I bet it was that Obama was Pres in 2013 and now @realDonaldTrump is President . #TrumpShutdown
AEGIS: @BarackObama : Please consider an annex to your presidential library for NYC: Trump will not have a library and his asterisk presidency is a response to your historic and great presidency: Every day he continues as president makes your presidency PHENOMENOLOGICAL. Thanks
For his 2009 inauguration, @BarackObama refused contributions from federal contractors. In 2012, he raised a $1.6Mil total from 23 contractors. In 2017, @realDonaldTrump raised $16.3Mil total from 63 contractors. http:// bit.ly/2DRjAIt
Curious, shouldn't @BarackObama 's profile say "Former-" or "Ex-" "President?" I mean, isn't that misleading, arrogant, and false to claim he's President? @realDonaldTrump @SecretService
Was privileged to see your interview with @Letterman & @BarackObama and learn more of your inspiring story - gentle, humble and so strong.
Well, I've watched his moves for decades and he wins aprx 90+% of his fights. IE He met w/his key-caucus men on the night before @BarackObama took the oath and set up the #Obstruction plan and except for Ted Cruz it all worked.

Thank you @realDonaldTrump for taking measures to actively destroying our relationship with our allies and undoing everything @BarackObama has done. Because of your bigotry, we have 3 more years to look forward to you destroying America.
Au contraire sir. I believe game, set and match for the economy go to @BarackObama .
Was that one of the "sitting duck" deaths caused by the insane @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton administration changes to Rules of Engagement (ROE)? "You're only allowed to fire if being fired upon." Also #Benghazi (see 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi)?
@DemRedistrict @EricHolder @BarackObama @KamalaHarris @JimmyGomezCA @DNC
Thanks @BarackObama !! We owe it all to you!
@BarackObama You made history as the first black President of the United States. However, you did nothing to advance People of color. You did however, do much to advance the agenda and interests of Muslims, not from this country but abroad. What did you exactly accomplish???
Dear god, do I miss voting for that man. Much love, @BarackObama . pic.twitter.com/TDLeRDLNM5

Thank you @BarackObama ..
Since @BarackObama left the entire world is in grave danger, thanks to the Toddler in Chief - the #Dotard @realDonaldTrump .
#release the memo 19 days gives @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton time to pack for prison pic.twitter.com/sYTH0hfRF5
(RE: critical divisions of thought in the US) "we are operating in completely different information universes." - @BarackObama on Netflix's "My Next Guest Needs No Introduction."
What about the FAISA memo? Why are Congressional Democrats quiet. @BarackObama @HilaryClinton are not that honest and truthful either. Liberal media(MSM) report/promote their #NeverTrump views.
Yea thanks @BarackObama , it was your policies on education, training, and employment that created these opportunities!
The United States economy is slow to respond; your recent signing of the tax scam bill has not yet impacted the economy. Therefore thank you, President @BarackObama .
@BarackObama is a guy who fought for what he believed
BRAVO!!!!!! @DiamondandSilk #GodBlessAmerica Home of the Free, bcause of the Brave! #Veterans #Soldiers who keep America Safe! @BarackObama
You advocated a government shutdown when @BarackObama was president, you are a horrible human being.
America values globally under @BarackObama was 48%. America values globally under #ShitholePresident @realDonaldTrump is now at a lowest boiling point of 24%. Can't wait for Trump to be sedated for colonoscopy.
hope u look into the matter soon! @narendramodi @ArvindKejriwal @rahulkanwal @smritiirani @OfficeOfRG @_SoniaGandhi @aajtak @ndtv @ZeeNews @sudhirchaudhary @laluprasadrjd @VasundharaBJP @abpnewstv @BBCWorld @BBC_HaveYourSay @BarackObama @AmitShah @INCIndia @BJP4India @aamir_khan
