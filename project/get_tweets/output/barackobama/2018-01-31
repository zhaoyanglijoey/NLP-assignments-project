Honestly, I think @BarackObama made the US so normally good that some thought BS was giving them a taste of what the 60s were like, but BS doesn't represent the 60s or a time of revolution. He was a side deal then with his views.
The young lady knows how to pick role models. @MichelleObama @BarackObama
I suspected that a small cell in the FBI were dirty before the election. Giuliani admitted it. So, just in case, I fired off a bunch of FOIA's to get the documents identified and hopefully retained, before @BarackObama left. Don't get mad. Get busy. @maddow @Lawrence

Always @BarackObama
Trump can't logically say that he caused the economy to increase and unimplemented to decrease. He's only been if office for a year. @BarackObama was in office for 8 years. But of course, Trump and logic go together as mush as snake and legs.
When exactly was @EricHolder investigating @BarackObama obstruction of justice again... I missed that entire required portion of you making a legitimate comparison.

@JudyWoodruff again tonight, I must correct you and guests. @potus always references WE THE PEOPLE, NOT HIMSELF. that was @BarackObama . He has accomplished so much and tonight you hit him on opoids and infrastructure. He can't do it all in one year.
Actually, we do miss @MichelleObama and @BarackObama because they actually had class unless the current present we have. @FLOTUS I have no qualms with you
the only difference between @realDonaldTrump and @BarackObama on demanding "loyalty" from political appointments in DOJ is that trump is blunt and up front about it; obama did the same stuff albeit more tactfully and deceitfully

The majority of ur twitter followers only follow u to laugh at u. @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton have dedicated real followers.
But she didn't build that, right? Someone else made that happen right? @BarackObama @SenWarren ? If I listen to democrats someone else made this happen like law abiding Americans and immigrants and tax payers who build roads and fire stations. #YouDidntBuildThat
HOW THE FUCK CAN I GET INTO A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHEN IM THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY, HOW THE FUCK CAN I APPRECIATE ANOTHER WHEN MY MIND IS SOMEWHERE ELSE @erna_solberg @BarackObama
"The @TheJusticeDept and the @FBIWFO have been under investigation by this committee for many, many months #FISA #abuse and other matters," @cnnbrk Dam this is heating up @HillaryClinton @BarackObama Russia... my bad Release, release the memo @POTUS GB @foxandfriends pic.twitter.com/7hvny4wHR6
So what? @BarackObama is why they have became Corrupt if they was a Rep? or Dem? they became Corrupt for one party and it was for the Democrat party
Thanks @BarackObama !
These two things are not mutually exclusive. This is like "fact-checking" @BarackObama when he touted econ recovery with a chart showing economic growth since the 1930's.
@greggutfeld Greg,, when someone shouted out '''you lie'' to @BarackObama that was true,,it was about Heath care that Obama was talking on and what he was saying ,, so it was a lie,,, Last night ,,not one word out of @realDonaldTrump mouth was a lie, it was all true,
So why didn't your bill pass when introduced twice during @BarackObama presidency (in 2013 & 2015). @IvankaTrump is working on a proposal. Actions do speak louder than words so give Ivanka a call. Put your $ where your mouth is. Unlike @BarackObama , @POTUS gets things done.
I truly believe Trump thinks @BarackObama was a very bad president. But that is just because he doesn't see any difference between 'bad' and 'black'.

It's hard to imagine another President who will match his compassion & the moral compass that guides his every step .. I do take that because of his success the up and comers in the Democratic Party will most assuredly want to emulate his character closely .. @BarackObama
@BarackObama Psst. Hey, Mr. Obama. How did you like Trump standing up there and taking credit for ALL THE WORK you did (setting the stage for this economic boom, etc. ) last night? Sucks, doesn't it? Hang in there. For Trump pride comes before the...

Hey @POTUS ... #Obama is better than you even over his #SOTU ratings. No matter how hard u try, no mater how much u obsess over him, u will never, ever, ever b better than @BarackObama at anything. U will never b even 1/100th the president, man, husband, father, human he is. #Trump

In a way I feel bad for low-IQ @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama supporters, who may be well-intentioned, but easily brainwashed and led astray, because they have no idea that their heroes are Luciferian psychopaths, and their whole worldviews and paradigms are about to get crushed.

@POTUS @BarackObama thanks for the hookup fam #rattpack
I feel @RepJoeKennedy & @BarackObama sound similar because both understand Dem values and Dem vision.
@BarackObama Was a guy with many words. His words were were wise & he spoke greatly of everyone. He should stand again
Kinda like @EricHolder being @BarackObama wingman

The #Gop killed @BarackObama for criticizing cops. WTF is wrong with them?

Warren you have absolutely lost your mind, you need to get off of the piece pipe. @potus has done more for America in a year than @BarackObama did in 8. That's the problem too, you democrats know he has done a good job and it is killing you.
Remember when Obama read a reply from a tweet from President Trump saying "I may go down as the worst president in US history, but at least I'll go down as a president." He got the first part right. When the memo comes out, Obama might get indicted. @releasethememo , @BarackObama

@realDonaldTrump Don - your #SOTU ratings last night were lower than last year's inaugural address and lower than all of @BarackObama #StateOfTheUnion addresses in his 8 years. Oh, and also...you are going to get impeached and go to jail.
I don't condone a member of Congress N middle of a SOTU2outburst for his/her 15minutes of fame. That said, @BarackObama has been caught N so many lies. I have no health ins, I don't have my Doc, & I've been paying out my $#%$% 4 years now. I'm 64 & not eligible for affordable INS
One leads by example. This young lady was inspired by you. I hope the best for you and @BarackObama is yet to come. I look forward to your leadership going forward. The project in Chicago is inspirational too.
Right now @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama #Democratic supporters are fawning over #GeorgeWBush . There's no difference between a neocon and neoliberal except identity politics.. @TheDemocrats are a major fucking failure party.

Do you ever think its b/c of the peter, GF, Andy text? Asking are you against like them. You know damn well they ,you,dems didn't think, didn't want trump to win.Thought @HillaryClinton Had it in the bag. Even @BarackObama thought that.DAMN RIGHT, I WOULD ASK THE SAME QUESTION.
In 2012 @BarackObama announced he would implement Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an unlawful executive action to effectively legalize the presence of illegal immigrants who had arrived in the United States as children.
