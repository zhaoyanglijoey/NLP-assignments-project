@BarackObama What do you think about this?
@OutFrontCNN @ErinBurnett your conversation with @Ocasio2018 was the best news coverage today. She is the most inspiring political figure since @BarackObama #classact #nov2018
@BarackObama we need your help
So what if @BarackObama is AWOL for the Dems. Dems just need to figure it out if they want to win. And it will take having a spine and growing the cojones to win against Republicans. Obama or HRC or Bernie is no longer the answer. Fight back. Fight dirty.

Should a president under investigation with less than 6 mos. to the next election be able to nominate a SC Justice? Hmmm? What would @SenateMajLdr do? Oh yeah we know. And @BarackObama wasn't even under investigation. Time to play fair right guys?
I miss you @BarackObama
We all wish,but that little turd in the road may be dried up but it won't blow away. @SenMajLdr doesn't care that he politically slapped @BarackObama in the face by ignoring Garland nomination for 18 months out of spite! I DESPISE this McConnell turd! @maddow @Snapandbud @ijefff
Trump & @GOP are So Corrupted it makes me sick ... to add to the long list of things he has said. I Pray Mueller gets this done & get that psycho out of office! @BarackObama step up
#disingenuous it was wrong when @SenateMajLdr made up xcuse 2 block @BarackObama pick 4 SCOTUS. It would b wrong now. The pick is by @POTUS & seldom wld Senate reject every pick 4 next 2.5 years. Our fault 4 not ensuring @HillaryClinton became Prez #ElctionsHaveConsequences
Why would you not stand up for @BarackObama 's choice in 2016? Not that you had to vote for him but to at least give him a hearing to be considered?
#fixbio fix @BarackObama 's bio

So true!! I miss the absolute decency @BarackObama brought to the office. How quickly we fallen into a cesspool of absolute pettiness.
@BarackObama there is a conventions error in your bio. Please fix.
Mr. Nance ur my favorite. U explained everything, in frightening detail in your previous book. McConnell has proven he was just prejudiced towards @BarackObama @SCOTUS nominee, all checks & balances are being destroyed. What can ppl w/ ur experience do to help stop this?
@LauraLoomer @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump I just figured why Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize. When he drew his "Red Line" in Syria, and they stomped over it by using chemical weapons, and he did NOTHING. That's why he earned it, for being chickens**t. And not having a "pair"
@BarackObama weakness and inaction will bite us in the ass for many generations to come. #weresoscrewed #goodbyeroevwade #hellohandmaid
Woohooo finally Hussein @BarackObama is winning at something
wait you mean his name isn't BITCH McConnell? I thought it was when he denied @BarackObama a Supreme court pick.
So not only did #Republicans withhold @BarackObama the right to appoint a justice, they are now going to be allowed ANOTHER appointment!? #whatcountryisthis
What if she were Republican and this was done to @BarackObama I wonder hmm
Hey there, @WilliamAyers . And please convey sincere regards from all of us to your bestie, @BarackObama .
Mcconnell has been the greatest threat to the democracy of the USA since @BarackObama was confirmed, worked to make Pres @BarackObama a 1 term president, put party before country in terms of economy and judiciary. Treasonous Mitch!
Dem leadership, pull yo' minds out of donor 'class' GOP narrative & framing; @donnabrazile just said "McConnell's rule" 4x ("let the people decide") AS IF We The People HAD NOT decided we wanted @BarackObama to choose nominees for SCOTUS seats vacated Jan 20 2009-2017. #thebeat
Dream on @BernieSanders in NO WAY did u win the election . But u did sellout. I understand you were being threatened with a lawsuit against your wife, the @DNC Debbie @DWStweets @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton are terrifying to go up against. In that respect you have my pity.
Why weren't you going wild when the @BarackObama admin was implementing the same policy? Open a book. Get some knowledge 2go w your passion & u won't sound like such an ignorant little baby. Grow up. #maga @DonaldJTrumpJr @WillieGeist @TheFive

You're right. If it's such a problem, why didn't @BarackObama fix it? Why did he have families separated? Why didn't he fix all this "gender unequality?" Must've been Bush's fault.
A majority of WE THE PEOPLE elected @BarackObama . He was not allowed to do his job of electing a justice to the SCOTUS. Since he was obstructed, any nominee OTHER THAN HIS is illegitimate. #RECALLGORSUCH

remind all the Dems screaming "we need to wait until after the Primaries" to fill the vacancy that @BarackObama filled a vacancy in August just b/4 primary so STFU
Say it ain't so @BarackObama not you too
LISTEN UP: @BarackObama on @JerrySeinfeld 's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee is the most interesting, endearing thing I've ever seen. Also both of them are daddies and I'm here for it.
. @SenSchumer , you can demand and keep demanding Congress to abide by the so called 'Biden Rule' all you want, sir. But as the @DNC Party leader and former President of these United States, @BarackObama , once said, "ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!"
These folks still blaming @BarackObama for everything. Y'all did NOT vote for anything except for the presidency prior to this catastrophe. Nunna y'all Americans - myself included ! - was showing up fighting congress etc. whatever to support a damn thing he advocated.

"Justice Kennedy" Just retweet to all saying Republicans should wait until after the election. @BarackObama FILLED A VACANCY IN AUGUST JUST PRIOR TO PRIMARY
I know #sophistry when I see it. if it's about policy, how many @BarackObama administration officials were refused service based upon his abhorrent immigration policies that separated families and deported more people and than all previous presidents combined?
We watch #FakeNews worship the Fraud, @BarackObama for years. And ignore his crimes, and Hillary's crimes.
This standard should have also applied to @BarackObama and his 2016 nominee. #Hypocrisy #SCOTUS #Election2018

Average time to confirm SC Justice after nomination: 25 DAYS. Number of days to Election when @BarackObama nominated Garland: 343. 343-25=318 days before Election. McConnell said his proudest moment was telling Obama to his face that his SC nomination would not get a Senate vote.

@BarackObama QC JD You know what i think it is about? Justice Kennedy is taking leave of the Court for a trial of the reality TV star from NYC and leaving the SCOTUS in the clear as the final court of appeal. Remember Justice Ginsberg has the Russia video from @StephenAtHome .
Someone needs to convince him to stay on until after midterms, though I have a feeling he was already pushed by Repubs to retire now. @SenateDems bring out the big guns and convince him to say6 on. Talk to Ginsburg and Sotomayor and have a round table. Come on. @BarackObama

Where were the liberals when @BarackObama was in office? Democratic people are hypercritical, one way when it's good for them,they don't want peace,they want to complain and justify the wrong things they do in this country. It's really good vs. evil Disgrace to USA!

They never supported him for his policies. They wanted someone to undue @BarackObama legacy. @realDonaldTrump promised them that. That's all that mattered. His supporters will follow him, because he represents the part of them, that they can't show on a daily basis. Bigotry!

You are correct here, nothing here to see. He had been doing it for YEARS before he was on the @realDonaldTrump campaign. Now, if you want something to "see" you should pull your head out of your butt and find out what Strzok is going to admit @BarackObama DOJ/FBI was up to.

Those freaking out over #Trump getting 2 #SCOTUS nominees in 2 years SHOULD HAVE gone after @BarackObama for TWIDDLING HIS THUMBS instead of challenging the GOP IN FEDERAL COURT for refusing to even consider his last nominee, but he was SO SURE #HillaryClinton would win he didn't pic.twitter.com/4hPgQDugom
#FearMonger @MSNBCPolitics Says Trump's going to take rights away from women & gays You would think they were talking about #MuslimSympathizer #TraitorInchief44 @BarackObama , not a man that has MORE than proven he ADORES women & who has never spoken ill of #LGTBQ #PureDEMPanic
Agreed. But why didn't @BarackObama fight harder, louder about this? 17 months into this administration I am growing more disappointed with everything he chose not to fight for. Not all of us can globe trot the stress away or upgrade our Kalorama swimming pools.

Call your senators to hold off the #SupremeCourtJustice vote until after midterms. We can't be hypocrites and vote during an election year. @SenateMajLdr said it during @BarackObama term and it should be the same under @realDonaldTrump . Midterms matter! Vote! #BlueWave2018
@realDonaldTrump is worth less today than when he was elected. Meanwhile @BarackObama was worth $3 mill when elected & is now worth $41 mill, and @BillClinton was worth $500k when elected & is now worth $242 mill. I don't need his tax returns.
@hillaryclinton and @barackobama this is your inevitable fate. The truth will surface. It always does, along with the corpses.
Dems against America & want to abolish @ice and OUR 2A WE must have secure borders and OUR constitutional RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS MUST REMAIN IN TACT They want to complete @BarackObama 's goal; overthrow USA @realDonaldTrump @PressSec

@SenToomey hold off the #SupremeCourtJustice vote until after midterms. We can't be hypocrites and vote during an election year. @SenateMajLdr said it during @BarackObama term and it should be the same under @realDonaldTrump
We learned w/ @BarackObama that voting just for a pretty face who speaks well can destroy our country. Say no to Socialism unless u want to end up like Venezuela. Why do Dems want to be Socialists when that's exactly who is trying to illegally cross our borders and come to US?
Let me quote @BarackObama "elections have consequens" Starting to LIKE that quote!

Hi @BarackObama . I miss you so much
@BarackObama Obama- You and Hillary created ISIS and are responsible for Hundreds of Thousands of horrible deaths! I know your scared right now because they have all the evidence! Prosecution's are coming! Come clean before you're stripped of your Presidency! A First in history!
The majority of Americans voted for @BarackObama to nominate SCOTUS but GOP stole the seat with unconstitutional shenanigans. Today's WH & Congress do not represent the majority of voters, due to election shenanigans. No way you're getting the next seat without #ABetterFight .
I WAS a democrat until @BarackObama screwed everything up . #WalkAwayMovement #WalkAway But if they did half the things @DineshDSouza says they did I never was...
Nominate @BarackObama @renato_mariotti @ErikJones4IL @PreetBharara
And more additions to the follow list. I'd ask for her to prove her multiple degrees but they're probably under seal, you know like @BarackObama
@BarackObama SOS come back!!!!!
Really?! Because @BarackObama fulfilled his but you all stole a seat from him, so we'll be holding the line until midterms. OK Coward? #NoVoteUntilWeVote #NoHearings pic.twitter.com/5OIRahWaNj
The Dems better block till the elections, just like they did to @BarackObama
A year and half in and already @POTUS has reduced #ISIS to nothing more than a footnote in history. Guess @BarackObama is pretty bummed that his little proxy got absolutely destroyed #MAGA
@DNC @TomPerez @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SenSchumer @Bakari_Sellers @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @BernieSanders . DEMs are tolerant to a fault of Sinister Bernie Sanders & his tiny coterie of political terrorists declaring Bernie Won. SCOTUS ?

Ok the other thing is we have not had checks and balances since @BarackObama left office so as bad as it is it is sorta the same? Idk help I'm drowning
@BarackObama was right, @HillaryClinton was right, but we still ended up with Treason Committing Fraud @realDonaldTrump !!
@BarackObama for #SCOTUS !!!
@SenateMajLdr you are an embarrassment to the United States and the people who reside in it. You are corrupt, bigoted and a hypocrite. when you die do you really think you can take all that dirty money with you? You OWE @BarackObama the biggest apology as well as the America

While I watch @SenateMajLdr talk about the next nomination of a supreme court justice after what he said about the nomination of @BarackObama I get angry. I mean, pissed! If you are with @TheDemocrats , you should bring your anger to the #polls this #November ! #Resist #Parkland
President Obama asked you to consider Merrick Garland? @BarackObama
The most silent in all these threats and encouraging of more violence... @BarackObama @MichelleObama @HillaryClinton . So much for #goinghigh .
It's as if Democrats should have listened for the past 5 years of warnings for this very scenario. Are those District & Circuit judges @BarackObama pushed through with 51 votes really worth 2 Supreme Court seats? Does Harry Reid feel one bit of remorse?
Hmmm Pinocchio @SpeakerRyan Sure is funny how the highest Military Spending EVER was in 2010 Under @BarackObama 's Watch & 1 of the lowest ever under the 1st year of UR Dictator Pal @POTUS #Trump 's Watch...

I would just like to thank you and the rest of @BarackObama 's goon squad for coming back and finishing off the Democrat party. #MAGA
@BarackObama definitely needs to come out of his self-imposed hiatus to BASH Mitch McConnell. There is NO ONE better suited for it. Except for maybe that guy Mitch refused to even have a vote on. Anyone know where Merrick Garland is these days?
@BarackObama is Sooooo pissed that he had Justice Scalia poisoned now.

@SenatorCantwell , @PattyMurray , please affirm that you will not confirm or consider any supreme court nominee for Justice Kennedy's open seat, and that you will do everything in your power to prevent same, just as McConnell did during @BarackObama 's presidency.

The more I think about it, the more I am forced to conclude that @BarackObama not acting on the intelligence of Russian interference was a massive failure on his and his subordinates' part.
@BarackObama thanks you
Please stop saying that we should wait until after the election to have a vote on a Kennedy replacement. That only legitimizes the Republican's theft of @BarackObama 's appointment. Don't normalize their unconstitutional behavior.
Foghorn Leghorn @SenateMajLdr rolled the dice and won. Really, the only way he could have lost was in letting @BarackObama 's nominee have a hearing.

@BarackObama should have appointed Garland and let the Supreme court rule on the advise and consent clause. There was no consent, neither was their denial. Worst mistake of his presidency.
Sorry @BarackObama I gotta a little veklempt just then and had to grab a tissue! MICHELLE OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT 2020! Dear, I miss you.

@BarackObama gives deranged lunatic Robert Deniro a medal and then the left goes after @GenFlynn ! Liberalism in a nutshell!
i think that sounds like good ground rules for the congressional and senate democrats (i know only the senate confirms, but) the new Dem majority if/when we ge tit in both houses needs to shut down the trump admin like the GOP did @BarackObama
@BarackObama pulls the nomination of Garland and nominates another radical leftist if @HillaryClinton wins. God knows they had enough cash to make Garland go away happy.
I find it highly suspect you weren't outraged when @BarackObama was in office. Why only now are you upset about this now that Trump is in office? Oh, I know, now illegal immigration is considered racism & inhumane because your party now supports open borders & no immigration laws

The liberals r such idiots. Trump is doing so well. Even when @BarackObama was our president he ruined our country with the things he didn't do, he was a wimp. Now we have a strong president who is making our country great again, And i am a registered democrat but not for long.
Stop coming over illegally, the laws have been the same for many years. Where were you when weasel @BarackObama was President? The parents bringing over children through the desert should be ashamed of themselves. We have to keep America safe
I have a feeling @BarackObama might have smoked an entire pack today when McConnell said the Senate is ready to do its Constitutional duty in confirming Kennedy's successor.

Has anyone checked on @BarackObama today? I'm worried....
Thanks @BarackObama !
@SenateMajLdr nope. Not going to happen. U set the rule with @BarackObama and we r sticking with it. Oh by the way. U SUCK!!! U want civility? There can't be any while the prick trump is your leader and kids are locked in cages and he is palling around with our sworn enemy Putin.

McConnell did not let the judiciary committee hear @BarackObama nominee for SC because elections were to be held in 8 months. Now they are being held in 4 months. The nomination must await mid-term elections!

You are more than a hypocrite, you will reap what you sow if you proceed different from how you demanded the Dems and @BarackObama do when Merrick Garland was nominated. As a career politician I know you have a convoluted rationale for your new position, but we deserve better
@TheJuanWilliams - the most vile president in United State's history is @BarackObama .
You could be the next Martin Luther King! @BarackObama And you are very wrong if you don't think we need you. Your silence is deafening. I know you want to respect the Bush's for respecting you. But hell, man, even the Bush's despise Trump!
Thanks @BarackObama
@BarackObama tried to tell us, but we didn't want to listen..... Elections have consequences #DontBooGoVote
Good man @DickDurbin he wont blindly block new SCt nominee, if someone he thinks qualified. And he reminded us Sen McConnel blocked @BarackObama #SCOTUS vote bc too close to elections & new house & senate should be seated. November is close.
@TheFive - The more I hear @TheJuanWilliams the more RACIST I think he is. - hates @realDonaldTrump - accuses of being worst pres. bcz of his comments. Fails to recall @BarackObama & his rants on Trey, & riots in MO where he jumped to wrong conclusions STHU!

@TheFive someone let @TheJuanWilliams know All the things his liberal friends in Hollywood said were threats against our @POTUS If famous people threatened to blow up the White House when @BarackObama was in there, Juan would be up in arms. The left is just a bunch of hate.
2012:It is terrible that @BarackObama did not appoint an independent counsel to investigate the national security leaks. No accountability.
@BarackObama It would sure be great to hear your voice on today's events. A lot of us who supported you are feeling a little panicked with todays new re: Justice Kennedy.
I look forward to the @SenateDems copying what that piece of human garbage @SenMajLdr did when @BarackObama nominated Garland. His excuse was that the "people should have a say," right Paul?

...As one of the best countries in the world - That was when @BarackObama was in Office. Now, while Trump's here, some people hate America. Now, I'm not blaming Trump completely, the people who write these kind of stuff make their own decisions, but Trump is an influence for...
I want someone to do an entire rewrite of "Baby Come Back" but "Obama come back" and it work somehow. @BarackObama How I wish to God you were here.
You mean you won't fund, Bill Clinton, @BarackObama , @SenFeinstein , @SenSchumer and @SenSanders Border wall. Because these people were adamant about a border wall long before President Trump came to office. The're just angry that they didn't have the political acumen to do it.

Yes, it is quite plain @BarackObama choked. Move on.
I'm wishing @BarackObama had chosen to fight harder. For a lot of things. Same goes for @JoeBiden but he was never in charge, ultimately. It's like Obama knew he'd be ok no matter what. That's all good and well but what about the country? #Seriouslybummed
