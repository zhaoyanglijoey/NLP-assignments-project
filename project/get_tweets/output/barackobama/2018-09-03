@BarackObama
Look, hon, you haven't even reviewed the historically voluminous number of records you already have been given. I know this is tough for you, but to paraphrase the immortal words of @BarackObama , "we won."
Lock her up for what? America has been great. If wasn't for @BarackObama you wouldn't be enjoying the economy that we have now. 45 inherited it..he didn't create or develop it.
@BarackObama Thank you for stepping up publicly with the truth. The more you are out there in the next 60 days, the better Dems will do. We need you, sir, more than ever. This veteran thanks you once again for your continued service to this country.
I bet you feel so fortunate that you inherited a booming economy from @BarackObama . You really should send him a Thank You letter!
Are people still surprised that @realDonaldTrump is a piece of shit and @BarackObama was and still IS a real president???
@BarackObama you suck

WHAT !? @CNN That's not how government works..I'm his Constituent. I don't work for him. HE WORKS FOR ME, YOU, US. I don't recall @BarackObama ordering citizens to just DO WHATEVER HE SAYS. pic.twitter.com/uZHhBJu3zh
@BarackObama has TWICE as many followers as Uncle Donald .... but ssshhhhhhhhh!!!! don't tell him feelings!
Again a reminder: In the last 4 years of @BarackObama , an average of 213 K jobs/mo were added; in the 1st 16 mo of @realDonaldTrump , 189 K jobs/mo added. Under BO, S&P up average of 30.3/mo; under DT, that average is 20.5/mo. Obama had 4 quarters > 4.2%.
@BarackObama is a Muslim who spent 8 years crippling the US from within. He is about as infidel as they come. Will the people ever know?
The break-in was not done under Nixon's instructions. Nixon could only look on in awe & envy at how totally corrupted the intel agencies,DOJ,IRS,etc became under @BarackObama
Funny, @EricHolder says he's @BarackObama 's wingman, and media loved it.
Out of all the former Presidents & First Ladies in a row, the only one I'd eat pizza with is @BarackObama . I'd try & help him out. The rest of the formers seem arrogant & pure strange. The energy between Michelle Obama & worst President ever Bush is weird & weinerish. pic.twitter.com/WPg1dN6rqn

@BarackObama The United States is a REPUBLIC, not democracy. For crying out loud get it right. Good grief! And you were president. What a joke!
@BarackObama We will pelt you with your truths on Authoritarianism. TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR. We know all about your DOJ/FBI/CIA. You lied about everthing and you already broke the code of a past president misspeaking against the office.
at least @realDonaldTrump is out in the open. @BarackObama did everything illegally in secret and we're paying the price for it now.
When I heard @BarackObama say "those in power seek to undermine every institution or norms that gives Democracy meaning" I thought he had finally started being honest about his presidency, his DOJ and his FBI. But apparently he is referring to @realDonaldTrump He is still corrupt
Yes but this weekend our entire nation has been mourning a genuine American war hero @SenJohnMcCain after very moving tributes from @MeghanMcCain @BarackObama #GeorgeWBush .. this was a weekend to remember our greatness, and that is too crushing for this insecure con man handle.
the difference is @BarackObama did everything underhanded and illegally. @realDonaldTrump is voicing the opinion of the country less the radical @dnc .
Integrity and @BarackObama are THE definition of an oxymoron.
That's funny because the only evidence that anyone was in bed with the Russians, is @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton so are just lying for the sake of spreading disinformation or are you just that uninformed?
Listening to fight back podcast & I remembered the day @BarbaraBoxer brought a Senator @BarackObama to a SAN Francisco ballroom in primary. I was there with hundreds. You could hear a pin drop when Barack spoke. I got tears in my eyes. Everyone there knew-that was our next Prez.
With all his comments about evil folks in public office I honestly thought @BarackObama was finally Confessing his sins! He described himself very well. #TheStory
@BarackObama just saw an article that its possible you could run for prime minister of canada. HELP US OUT!!! SOS #obamaforprimeminister2019

Thank you @BarackObama for guiding us out of the GWB/GOP/Lehman Bros recession and solid growth through 2017. No surprise that tRump and Huckabee (Hound) Sanders are taking credit for the entire expansion, but will blame Dems when #GOPTaxScam causes stagnation.
Media for scandals, if a black gets shot by th PD you clam its corrupt, the system is against blacks, The great Divider @BarackObama called them corrupt, But when the @POTUS say the same you turn to the Media The same ones that said, crooked @HillaryClinton Wins. sheep fits
He was a petty, mean old man. Wouldn't respect the Office of Presidency with Trump, but sure kissed a**es of @BarackObama and George W Bush who also disrespected Pres. Trump. I didn't vote for Obama, but respected him as President (only). Big secrets need to be exposed.

Indeed. Thanks, @BarackObama , for setting things right over 8 years. We're all reaping the economic rewards. We all pray @realDonaldTrump 's ignorance and selling us out to Russia isn't the end of the great country you lead. May he resign or get impeached ASAP!
Yes. What we noted is how @BarackObama divided the black community. Color-coding society didn't work with busing or affirmative action. People have a natural tendency to "move." A black man told me, "I worked hard all my life to get out of ghetto. Now they want to bus us back."
@AGJeffBSessions @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan We all knew this who researched him in 2008. @BarackObama was not eligible to play Little League Baseball in the United States w/out a birth certificate. @NancyPelosi committed Election Fraud certifying him to be eligible as President. pic.twitter.com/UwH5to15wF

No. They hated @BarackObama because he was black.
He only knows criminal life. He breathes darkness and guilt. But the American people are more energized than people at his hate-filled rallies. Americans will #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica and place America back on a steady course. Missing the leadership of @BarackObama @MichelleObama
But @BarackObama wouldn't have. And they hated him, anyway.
