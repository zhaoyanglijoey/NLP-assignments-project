you became a complete disappointment during the 8 years @BarackObama was in office. I thought so highly of you until you started sounding like a bitter field house negro that got put back in the field. now you want to have kid gloves with trump. real pathetic of you pic.twitter.com/b5ZbpkV2Bx
@BarackObama We miss you Mr. President Obama.
@SenJohnMcCain @cindymccain @MeghanMcCain Sen McCain, thank U for defending Pres Obama when a critic accused him of being an Arab. U have morals, U set a great example for our country God bless you & your family. @BarackObama #JohnMcCain
83% of that bull market was under OBAMA! Thanks @BarackObama !!!
Strange thing to say to a lifelong #Democrat . You know, the party known having a "herding of cats" problem. & considering @BarackObama won twice, in historically what are considered landslides, and @HillaryClinton got 2nd highest total ever, guess I'll stick to my "small group."
@BarackObama Fri-Yay? Can be if #BarackObama steps up for Chicago
Right now @BarackObama could fill up a stadium if he made a speech.
@BarackObama thoughts about @BetoORourke for 46th?
@BarackObama , This video means so much. If it were shown at your library and if we could look at a @SenJohnMcCain civics course for our schools. I don't know where to begin, maybe you can point us to how to do this ?
Thanks @BarackObama - your economic legacy at least continues to endure! GREAT JOB!!

As much as I disagreed with President @BarackObama he was NEVER "not my president. As immoral as I thought his decisions were at times, I never panicked. Despite most of the press being AWOL. Because of faith in my fellow Americans, not the government, and even more in God.

I care if @POTUS has had a crime spree; I care if @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton had a crime spree. Oh that is right, they have but @AGJeffBSessions cannot see beyond @POTUS appointment of him to head @TheJusticeDept . What happened before he has no interest in enforcing.
In the 2008 election, Nebraska split the electoral vote for the first time in history; @BarackObama received enough votes to win district 2. McCain received 4 electoral votes, Obama received 1. I live in District 2 My vote counted for the first time EVERY. VOTE. MATTERS!
I hate to make comparisons but I feel the same type of hope and inspiration that @BarackObama evoked early on. I hope the @DNC gives him a prominent speaking role for 2020 convention. He has "it". The complete real deal.
Government using taxpayer dollars to choose winners and losers is straight out of the @BarackObama and Establishment economic playbook. #DoneVotingRepublican #Unfollow

@TiffanyDCross did you @JimBrownNFL32 is at again saying he is supporting agent/orange AKA ( @realDonaldTrump ) in 2020. Tiffany this is very sad. Sounds like he just wants to be in the limelight. Does this not surprise you? Remember he bashed @BarackObama when he was POTUS.
Trump, @SenateMajLdr 's ability to appoint Kavanaugh to the SCOTUS while @BarackObama couldn't even get Merrick Garland meetings ( after 44 even got approval from @SenateMajLdr of Garland) is the epitomy of white male privilege.
My chin is on my chest. America & the intelligence agencies had a rocky start & certainly have made huge mistakes, but like @BarackObama said, we are 'going for a more perfect union' ... every day we get up and try to follow what we preach. To attack our own??? #hardball #inners

Didn't Mad Maxine lie & coerce @BarackObama to bail out her husband's bank. Can we impeach Mad Maxine for misusing Congressional funds and campaign funds by having her family members on the payroll? Mad Maxine is still the most corrupt member of Congress. #CensureMaxineWaters
So beautiful. I miss you @BarackObama I miss your caring soul leading the USA Thank you for your service. We are better because of it.

Such sad news about John McCain. His greatness was shown in his mutual respect with @BarackObama . The two encapsulated what politics should be about - two decent people with good ideas debating with intelligence to explain why they should be in charge of the big decisions.

So, he didn't surf into the White House on @BarackObama 's coattails? Huh. I thought the Dow was at 7949.09 on 1/20/2009, and by 1/20/2017 it had rose to 19827.25. Must have been a pipe dream.

It started in 2009. Thanks @BarackObama !
If trump came in after bush we all would've commit suicide by now.... Thanks to @BarackObama we have a thread to hang on
or another minion (Trump can give them some advice through the glass at Sing Sing). MARK IT. @BarackObama @MichelleObama @JohnBrennan @HamiltonMusical @Lin_Manuel @MBMBaM @PodSaveAmerica @JeffBezos @0Markzuckerberg
Great Point!!! I'd forgotten all about @BarackObama millions spent to keep his background totally secret. Stormy Daniels may or may not be lying, but BHO is certainly concealing something big.
Rafael, go back to Canada! Remeber when @BarackObama insulted your wife?? ... neither do I
The Trump Organization will be bankrupted and shuttered. All their golf courses and resorts will be sold off. The Trumps will go down as the... @BarackObama @MichelleObama @JohnBrennan @HamiltonMusical @Lin_Manuel @MBMBaM @PodSaveAmerica @JeffBezos @0Markzuckerberg
@BarackObama Policy debate, a child's safety measures, 2 years to opening of Tokyo Paralympic Games, food is also in indigo blue!
Thanks @BarackObama !!!
Along side the @BarackObama voters!
I WAS RIGHT, HUH? I predicted this THE DAY Mueller was appointed. Donald Trump is going to prison for the rest of his life THE MINUTE he steps... @BarackObama @MichelleObama @JohnBrennan @HamiltonMusical @Lin_Manuel @MBMBaM @PodSaveAmerica @JeffBezos @0Markzuckerberg
@BarackObama hello Mr ex-Pres. the wife and I are still big fans. The way I see the battle to get uncle Don outta the White House is the Joe, young Kennedy and yourself as sec state. Put quite simply, the best is yet to come....
Where's @RealDonaldTrump 's tweet about Hawaii facing a hurricane today...how it's such a low rated "country" anyway? Not to mention how they issue "fake" birth certificates! @BarackObama @GOP @TheDemocrats
Thanks @BarackObama
Are people still scared to call Fox News a racist news station? Remember they loved birtherism against @BarackObama
Unless you include @BarackObama .

@SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr will never let that happen unless the president name were @BarackObama or @HillaryClinton
he is a great man. because he did what he said. he is not lier ... about #Iran #China #Mexico #Job #EU #UN #USARMY #Syria #Russia #America needs a president like him, #Obama was a asshole because he sold us in 2009 to Mullahs and gave them 150 billion $. shame on @BarackObama
So DonaldTrump is a better president than @BarackObama , he didn't get help from the Russian's to be the president
Thanks @BarackObama ! Now Ivanka, get your pop, the adulterer, to release his tax returns. Oops. His CFO will give us what we need. #immunity Also, stop making your garbage in #china
Imagine if during the @BarackObama Presidency, it was discovered that a major news organization had a special safe dedicated to hiding and burying stories that Obama didn't want to be made public! JUST IMAGINE HOW QUICKLY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPEACHED!
If any one treated an @BarackObama office like this the media would be outraged & demand an apology, or called racist & sexist. If you invite someone on your show let them talk. Where did the basic human & social etiquette go?

You remember that one time when @BarackObama used Grey Poupon in his burger and @SeanHannity committed a 45 minute segment to it? I do. #PouponHannity
Still waiting for @Acosta to give an example of how tough he was on @BarackObama . pic.twitter.com/OlZDnkIUaK
I respect him as well. #McCain already asked @BarackObama to speak at his funeral. That is a person of character. Fuck em, Koko Talk about immature-
Also someone who referred to @BarackObama as "that one" in 2008 and really started this divide & hate in America. Also someone who gave the world @SarahPalinUSA of "I can see Russia from Alaska" fame.
Thank u @BarackObama
@BarackObama caused all these. He was the one who invited northern Politicians to the #WhiteHouse for a plan of how to oust #GoodluckJonathan , he wanted people America can control, he knew northerners are easy to convince, now see the disaster he imposed on us. Shame on America!!
You are right, that collapse happened during your term with @BarackObama . Thank you for realizing this nation will heal during this term with @POTUS in the following 6.5 years, all you need to do is hide under a rock.
thank you for your great work on the economy @BarackObama

Of course #MSM will not cover. This looks bad for their beloved Obama. How about it @BarackObama what do you have to say about your failure of Obama Care. See... he is hiding and being quiet. I know give him a chance.

Has @realDonaldTrump blamed @HilaryClinton or @BarackObama for it yet? #sarcasm
Thanks @BarackObama Unforunately, @realDonaldTrump is well on his way to destroying things again, like the #CorruptGOP always does. pic.twitter.com/hYhu9UFoMW
@SenJohnMcCain should be recognized as one of the greatest servants to USA to never be president. It is unfortunate he had to run against legacy W. Bush and then again against his aftermath. I'm confident @BarackObama will do this hero justice, when the time comes. @chrislhayes
@ChrisCuomo ok your ignorance is really showing. The @dnc @hillaryclinton @BarackObama all the #HollywoodElites #LyingLiberalMedia tried to stop @realDonaldTrump from becoming @POTUS here was outcome. Not fair #STFU pic.twitter.com/zTjAwEy79m
During the 2008 Presidential campaign, @SenJohnMcCain WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY ONE, to ATTACK the CHARACTER of his opponent, then Senator @BarackObama ! It literally brought me to tears!! Counters Obama 'Arab' Question https:// youtu.be/jrnRU3ocIH4 via @YouTube
But you DID postponed, @BarackObama 's nominee, right? Hypocrite.
Important: The bull market started 3,453 days ago. 9.1 years total. Of that time Trump has only been in office the last 581 days. Facts matter, not alternate ones. Thank you @BarackObama ! These fools sure like twisting facts!
Thanks to @BarackObama
Because in today's political climate I wonder Tommy boy was an "early supporter" of @BarackObama ? Because if he was clearly it would mean Barack endorses this type of #SexualAssault ...Right @jaketapper @brianstelter @ChrisCuomo @chrislhayes @maddow @kasie @JoeNBC @maggieNYT
Our Economy is setting records on virtually every front - Probably the best our country has ever done. Thanks @BarackObama !!! Tremendous value created since his Election. But since my election the World is laughing at us again! Companies are Fleeing the U.S.A.
@JesseBWatters How is @realDonaldTrump arranging to bury something embarrassing before the election any different that @BarackObama quashing the photo of him and Louis Farrakhan before his election?
Blame it on President @BarackObama
Only thing is; we'll never be corrupt enough to stoop to these low tactics. Even corrupt @BarackObama finished out his terms. Look how well that worked out, though.
@BarackObama , defined incredible. The country is built of millions, he is only one to fight for us. Nobody does define him, nor ever will they. He fought for us, does anybody else? No, it all is for power, for the rest.

With the release of the family statement on John McCain President @BarackObama or President @HillaryClinton would have thanked him for his service and sent wishes to his family. Wanna bet #CrookedDonald doesn't mention it?
Thank you @BarackObama !!!

@BarackObama Sir, A fine and honorable man, who worked for you passed yesterday. Mr. George Sheldon saved my daughter's life. He loved children. Miami Herald has details. Just thought you should know. Miss you so much.

Schiff ur a dark and terrible man! Arrest @HillaryClinton @BarackObama and his pack of criminals!
A continuation of the Obama presidency. We should be thanking @BarackObama
OH @strandbookstore : When I get sad, I just watch videos of @BarackObama .
I miss our last real President @BarackObama You were simply the best.. coherent sentences, no scandals, no crimes just class, morals and intelligence #bringObamaBackAgain
@BarackObama I miss you big guy
Yes! We were barely afloat with @BarackObama . You let the Dems have control and we are back where we started and worse
Thank you @BarackObama
@BarackObama was the worst president ever and the one who wrote the MOST unconstitutional executive orders of any. What does that say about his view of our constitution? That he's anti individualism and pro government. Like all his establishment.
Thanks @BarackObama !
As a #bigly fan, I can hear @AndTheBandAides doing Trump singing "You Were On My Mind" to @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton https:// youtu.be/7LEhF0IQju8 "When I woke up this morning You were on my mind And you were on my mind I got troubles, whoa-oh I got worries, whoa-oh"
So Much Service by #JohnMcCain . I will ALWAYS remember him grabbing da Mic to REJECT the racism directed towards @BarackObama . #HONOR
@BarackObama deserves the most credit for getting it started. #Obama
#FlashbackFriday when we had a President with integrity! @BarackObama #Integrity pic.twitter.com/yeTiekvdXH
@BarackObama was yet another #neocon war criminal President who surely disappointed many (including me) so why would anyone vote for his wife who must surely be tarred with the same brush. #US (and to a lesser exent #UK ) #Exceptionalism & #Warmongering must be eradicated.
Even @BarackObama was able to make it to the Care Bears Birthday Party! pic.twitter.com/q7TW0Z2TxM
Worth remembering, amidst National Enquirer headlines: The @latimes kept the Rashid Khalidi tape hidden in 2008 so that @BarackObama could become president.
@BarackObama Oh for an honorable President. Your leadership set the bar that Trump cannot reach. Thank you! The events of the last few days give me hope because the wheels of justice are turning slowly ever so near crime in high places.
Thanks @BarackObama !
Dear . @MichelleObama and . @BarackObama Looking thru some of @PeteSouza amazing photos of your very missed time in the White House I realized I am missing Bo and Sunny. Any chance you have some recent photos of the 'kids' your could share? Greatly appreciated.
Devoid of any logic. Candidates have never produced their college transcripts, YET the omniscient FemFighter KNOWS from where @BarackObama filed his application? @realDonaldTrump 's transcripts? He can't speak English. MOST importantly, what's he hiding in his Tax Returns?
Despite all the obstruction from the @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP , @BarackObama administration succeeded. Now the #GOP and @realDonaldTrump are taking credit for the economy. You are gutting ACA (Obamacare) and you gave welfare ( #TaxReform ) to the rich.
#Communist @BarackObama sure is #flexible
PS.... @BarackObama is not president anymore so we dont have to pretend this is OK...
Maybe the soaring economy from @BarackObama will help you buy some treats in the prison canteen to make friends with the other ladies. #MAGA ! #TrumpResign pic.twitter.com/dPZ3iXizY5
