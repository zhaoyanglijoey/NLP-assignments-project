Um @LesleyRStahl it was @BarackObama who separated children from their families at the border, here's the proof. R.I.P. to your logic. pic.twitter.com/qBZySJ6ej0
. @potus @realDonaldTrump LIES, about family separation that he enforced, NAFTA, economy (so strong DUE TO @BarackObama ). @LesleyRStahl looking like a patsy. It is not same as #Obama on family separation. And if it is,, then you have FAILED mightily.
@LesleyRStahl What a disrespectful interview with @realDonaldTrump on @60Minutes . Imagine if reporters took the same tone with @BarackObama . You conducted an interrogation, not an interview. This is shameful and irresponsible bias.
Did Lesley Stahl ever grilled @BarackObama like she's doing to @realDonaldTrump ? Yeah I didn't think so either. #DoubleStandards #60Mins

The @CBSNews @60Minutes segment on @realDonaldTrump is a joke. The media is still trying to push some sort of Russia collusion. They should be investigating the DNC. Never have I seen an interview like this with former President @BarackObama her bias is stunning. #FakeNews
Wish she was that hard with @BarackObama
I wish #lesleystahl was this hard with @BarackObama
@BarackObama giving out pillows and blankets LMFAO! Soft!

yes, after his meeting with @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton some cypher accounts grew and silence was made
Thank you @BarackObama . I'm proud to say I voted twice for you. Your words ring true and are so needed at this time in our history.
@NBCNews is a joke. Go back to reporting on celebrities and sports like you did for the eight years of Obama's administration. If you reported how @BarackObama was actually destroying and dividing America like you say @realDonaldTrump is, then you might have some credibility.
Just noticed that @FLOTUS is only following 6 people on Twitter and one of them is @BarackObama ..... (Btw the best president of all time, may I add) but bit of a blow to her husband @realDonaldTrump lol. pic.twitter.com/lSoukbATIN
I'm so sick of hearing people complain about Trump not releasing his tax returns. Yet, @BarackObama had all his crap sealed. Despicable at best. Put up or shut up!!!
I love @BetoORourke I respond to him as I did to @BarackObama but we really need a female #POTUS
@BarackObama did not had spine and history speaks for itself now.
I don't think' they'll ever be another one like him, damn I miss having a real compassionate caring well spoken human being' like @BarackObama . America needs a great leader again! @BetoORourke @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden @CoryBooker wouldn't it be great to have #Obama as vice-pres pic.twitter.com/utKubnpSQS

You have a very short memory. The economy is no better than it was under @BarackObama as far as job creation wage growth and GDP, the only true measures of an economy and no where close to as good as under @BillCinton that AVERAGED a 4% GDP all eight years.
@HillaryClinton Democrats would be thrilled to see you together with @BarackObama again at a rally Madam Hillary. Can this be possible as the midterm elections are around the corner? #HillaryObamaMidtermRally2018
@BarackObama your LORD(S) ask me to leave you alone ... what do you get ? Being the devils right hand
@barackobama DIDN'T DO CRAP for Brunson, or anyone else in AMERICA. Why doesn't he take his big eared self on and stop haunting America. @realDonaldTrump has done more for America than that self serving PO . Why doesn't he go devour his country like is did OURS.
So Says the @TheDemocrats Who FORCED @BarackObama Care on USA :/

@BarackObama We need you stumping for our candidates!

Ha, hardly. Stop watching @FoxNews fox and get to know what's going on in the real world. When you see the world protesting the ass-clown @realDonaldTrump , you know that was @BarackObama 's legacy at work.
Reverse? @BarackObama is the one who set it in motion. Need I remind you that tariffs and confused rhetoric has sent the stock market tumbling of late?
@realDonaldTrump is the @BarackObama eraser!
So wonderful they got to meet President Moon and his wife, so precious. I wish @BTS_twt could also meet @BarackObama (he inspired Mic Drop) but politically maybe not, idk, I'm just thinking out loud. Sorry if saying this offended anyone.

@BarackObama was a terrible president and he got a second disastrous term. Trump has the economy rolling!!!

Hi @BarackObama hope ur having a good day! Miss u!!
It's sad to think someone would disgrace an American President like this. You might have your disagreements with @realDonaldTrump which is fine but this is just nasty. I wonder how people would feel if this was President @BarackObama 's face on toilet paper???? pic.twitter.com/67aFWVKeRe
The candidate that has the best chance of winning is the one who motivates the base. @BarackObama or @HillaryClinton Who did the base love more? How did it turn out?

@BarackObama really????
The unemployment rate for Black or African American fell 9% when @BarackObama was Potus. Under @realDonaldTrump is dropped 1.8%. What numbers are you looking at?

Despite the media blitz, immense celebrity status & rubbing shoulders with big-name celebrities, @BarackObama left a weak platform for the democrats to win an easy election. Democrats need to reinvent themselves ASAP for #Elections2020 @SenWarren @SenSanders @TheDemocrats
It seems like everything he tweeted about @BarackObama has come back to bite him on the arse.

@BarackObama had ppl who loved to stay in power. Way beyond the term time. @realDonaldTrump shows his cabinet is different. They come and go showing position of power does not stay and linger. @FoxNews
Dinesh was put injustly by @BarackObama who did so many more of the same things,but fake news closed their eyes.His pardon is legit !!!
Just viewed @BarackObama speech loved it, articulate, sense of humour and so intellectual whereas the current @POTUS in comparison is a vindictive spiteful boring moron who nominated an alleged sex offender to the highest court namely @BrettKavanaugh WTF is happening to USA

@carlymoore_ yoooo u know my homeboy @BarackObama follow u?!
Dems need to do two things - sort their messaging out at every level and second realize their media strategies are too Mad Men era and need to be overhauled. Stunned by the level of ineptness across @TheDemocrats - @BarackObama team got it but not enough of them now to staff races
@BarackObama :was nothing but a SMOOTH operator. Only benefited himself. BAD FOR AMERICA //youtu.be/P3hY1eagq88
There is nothing good happening for him to take credit for. @BarackObama has always run from the problem. He has no solution, just hate for #America
Yet Beyonce and Jay-Z visiting President @BarackObama got their knickers in a twist...go figure...
Are you sure? So far his supporters have demonstrated a decided lack of critical thinking skills and a willingness to blame everything on the minority party, the former candidate, or @POTUS44 @BarackObama .
Really....He placed liars cheaters on his Cabinet...I think @BarackObama wins the war on embarrassing moments in the OO

So you will be apologising to @BarackObama then? That's great!
Did you hate @BarackObama , @freddyatton for kids in cages? Separation of families? Tell me @freddyatton , are you an honest person? You better not say yes because this poll proves not!
Eight years of @BarackObama 's lawlessness has cauged rage in alot of Americans. Dirt bike riders have now taken over the streets in D,C and are wreaking havoc with drivers in their cars and people on their streets.
didnt the ACA website crash in its first week costing tax payers billions @BarackObama Care was Never Affordable and was always a failure
@BarackObama you was the best president ever !
@realDonaldTrump is paying for it out of his personal campaign while @BarackObama was rein-burst by the @DNC . Big difference.
Charlie I'm a huge @POTUS supporter but lets be honest about the economy. @BarackObama took over an economy in ruins after 8 years of #BushCheney . Remember the financial crash, the housing crisis, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, TARP, etc.? That wasn't Obama's fault.
The politics of splitting hair And convenient wedge issues And fear to make you illogical. Typical republican strategy. @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @BarackObama

almost - but alas! unlike @BarackObama who wanted them to move here and take Americans jobs - @POTUS is creating opportunities for them in their homeland. Where they should stay and succeed. Stop the invasion of USA with silly everybody gets citizenship Oprah type hype.
Not good enough David. We need more from you and @BarackObama than just voting. We need anger and protest. Lay it on the line.
Success Shaming is now acceptable within liberals - is anybody attacking @BarackObama or @MichelleObama for their estate planning? I'm sure, they are not paying all the taxes they could pay. They - like all millionaires - use tax planning systems (all legal) to keep more money.
The problem @BarackObama with ruling with a pen and a cell phone is that eventually someone else comes along with another pen and a cell phone. Bye Bye Obama legacy.
@BarackObama intuitively it was clear they forced you to sign in those horrendous executive orders.
You'll never leave @BarackObama alone, will you? He's not even President anymore!! OH! You mean Donald Trump?? Yeah... I'm sorry... You wrote "The President" so that threw me off. He's not a President. He's a criminal who stole the White House.
@BarackObama I know chances are slim, but if you any free time in the February, particularly the 4th Sunday, the Greater Little Zion Baptist Church in Fairfax, VA is having it's Black History Program and it would be a huge honor if you came. #ForTheCulture #BlackExcellence

@realDonaldTrump the Jobs President WINNING!!! @BarackObama The MOBS President WHINING!!! @HillaryClinton Nobody's President DRINKING!!!!
out of those two, it has to be Obama. @realdonaldtrump would have folded up like a lawn chair if he had inherited the mess that @BarackObama walked into. Trump was handed a healthy economy and a majority congress and still has accomplished very little.
@BarackObama is an inept fool. @realDonaldTrump is an effective leader.
