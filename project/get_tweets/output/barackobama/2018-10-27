No longer controlled by the racist demac-Rats!free at last!@realDonaldTrump made it happen !eat your heart out @BarackObama you lost and we won! #MAGA pic.twitter.com/tD7fDPWeQP
@barackobama Barack was born a b457ard and he's living down to the title. .
I know @realDonaldTrump could never have empathy, a heart or show compassion, care and love like President @BarackObama but instead of him going to that rally he should've been in Pittsburgh showing some kind of care & love for those who lost loved ones but that's just me.
@BarackObama Thank you, Mr. President. You served your time, and you've earned the right to your peace and days with your family, but you continue to speak the truth and fight the good fight.
FYI: When we say "Where We Go One We Go All"....... You are Not included @BarackObama !!! I think GITMO is just about ready for you now.x Trump will Win (legitimately again:) then your time is up!!! #WWG1WGA #QAnon #MAGA &
@BarackObama calls on Americans "to fight the rise of anti-Semitism" after synagogue shooting http:// hill.cm/nOpobHp pic.twitter.com/4GAvtYEXLT
I am so sick of @BarackObama ! He is a DISGRACE!
@BarackObama Do you ever wonder why you have almost twice the amount of followers as @realDonaldTrump and Twitter now says most of his are fake?
Dear @BarackObama , Perhaps former Presidents could together make a short video w/some calming, unifying, healing, bipartisan words to Americans (and the world) to introduce the balm of true Presidential Leadership into this unfortunate immoral vacuum.
This man... @BarackObama makes our American forefathers smile with pride...
How does it make you feel that @BarackObama has almost double the amount of followers you have?
@BarackObama NEVER lies!! pic.twitter.com/gxuO2DCFJT
Cuz Trump is loving it.....even made a joje sbout it at his HATE RALLY in Illinois @Comey @EricHolder @BarackObama Voting will NOT STOP THIS.
@BarackObama ... drooled over himself no less than 98 times... during his last spouting... that was once every 24.21 seconds He finished by saying... "Look I've got salad dressing on MY shirt." Salad dressing...right... more like DROOL!
Can't you run again????? @BarackObama
Who do you think has been stepping up as a leader at a time when our president is unable to do so? Here's some for me: @JohnBrennan @donlemon @ChrisCuomo @AdamSchiff @washingtonpost @CNN @nytimes @BarackObama @JoeBiden And @VP came through today.
Do you wonder the reason this man Berry aka @BarackObama would be concerned with today's news? What when were the reason?
If anything, the more I hear @BarackObama speak, the more entrenched and supportive I am of @POTUS and his desire to undo everything Obama did.
Yeah, because the corrupt former liar in chief used the @FBI and @TheJusticeDept as his own hit squad. @BarackObama was and remains a stain on this nation.
Truth comes out Donald Trump is unfit President of the #UnitedStatesOfAmerica Trump MUST NOT BLAME #Democrats #Twitter #socialmedia #news , or anything, because it's all Donald Trump's FAULT. THEREFORE, we Americans, people of color, students of color listen @BarackObama #VoteDem pic.twitter.com/QSsYHMIuCL
It's funny, isn't it, how every violent act was blamed on @BarackObama by the right wing media during his tenure as our president, yet @realDonaldTrump is completely blameless to them. A victim, even.
From the phony @BarackObama whose picture celebrating with anti-Semite Louis Farakhan was suppressed: We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. pic.twitter.com/cIWsvrcQWb
If your heart is hurting & you need something Presidential... @BarackObama has you covered.
@BarackObama who sold out America
Ladies & Gentlemen....The (REAL) President of the United States....acting presidential, empathetic, measured & like a grown up!! Thank you sir! @BarackObama #MyPresident #PittsburghStrong pic.twitter.com/lYHTGZupGx
@realDonaldTrump When are you going to arrest @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @georgesoros and the rest of the traitors to America, democracy, and freedom? #LockThemUp #TheStorm #WalkAway #WWG1WGA pic.twitter.com/uVt5mr1FiL
@BarackObama vs @realDonaldTrump ( @POTUS ) pic.twitter.com/8HiVq9La18
I remember @BarackObama Said "They come with knives We come with guns" "We talk to these people..So I know who's ass to kick" "The Cops acted Stupidly" I don't recall Conservatives,supporters of Trump acting up,BS Riots,shaming ppl at supper,bombs,politicians encouraging violence
It's rich for the guy who's job as senator (paid by taxpayers) didn't show up to vote on important legislation 174 + times but he's encouraging other people to do so! Honesty, integrity, ethics, morality are deficient in democrat circles. @BarackObama @DNC @GOP @CBS @FoxNews
@BarackObama Watching this video, I shed a tear, because I realized how much you and your decent nature are missed. How President Obama handles hecklers https:// youtu.be/IKqhyzvBQM4 via @YouTube
@BarackObama MUSLIM PIG
@BarackObama America knows just how corrupt your administration was! We are glad your are out of the White House!
@Potus44 was an actual president who was able to show compassion during times like today. Not so with #Dumpy . He chose a hate rally over consoling victims families. #MobBoss could never be @BarackObama . We all miss compassion from the heart not a TelePrompTer.
He sang "Amazing Grace." Thank you, @BarackObama .
Thank you for being OUR president @BarackObama
Well now! @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Every Tweet I attempt to Retweet TWITTER STATES TWEETS HAVE BEEN DELETED Cheers! I am currently in TWITTER TWILIGHT ZONE.. Must have pissed off @jack and hooray! Obama FYI @BarackObama WORST PRESIDENT EVER
Science is computer not changing the country @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama
God I miss @BarackObama never thought that I would look at the Bush administration as reasonable.... They seem like the good ole days now. Wow is the bar been set low now
THIS. The amount of semantics some news reporters even have gone through trying not to say it over this last week or two (even today!) is truly astounding. @BarackObama managed to say it today at least in his tweet...

Cry me a river, 45. A president named @BarackObama created a health care plan to provide quality #Healthcare for millions of uninsured Americans, but 'cuz he was him & the "haters" were out to get him, he faced birther vitriol for 8 yrs & rec'd a #pipebomb in the mail this wk.
Who transfered me to USA? Is this a joke? @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama
Did you say the same thing about @BarackObama while people were shooting others because of hate?? #VoteRed #WalkAway #goaway pic.twitter.com/MUB5fyR0Qa
@BarackObama Obozo, indictments for those on your administration are a-coming!!! I pray you are one of those indicted. Worst. President. Ever.
@BarackObama is a man of dignity & eloquence. Trump violates his standards (limited, though they are), faster than he can lower them!
The secret to the success of the 2020 democratic nominee will be a positive 3 word slogan eg. #YesWeCan Barack Obama @BarackObama #GrabAnOar Jason Kander @JasonKander #BringItHome Andrew Gillum @AndrewGillum Those are the ones I can think of right now. Retweet & add your own!
Does your heart go out to the family of @HonorBrianTerry who was killed while protecting our birder by #FastandFurious guns sold by @EricHolder and covered up by @BarackObama ?
@BarackObama
Sadly, I couldn't hear anything. However, I've read @BarackObama 's statement and I whole heartedly agree. Sorry for being so anal, but that's not such a bad thing.
In what way, you mean @BarackObama @RepMaxineWaters @RepAlGreen @keithellison Support for Jewish hater @LouisFarrakhan ? Yes, I agree. pic.twitter.com/0uyBQQzUbM

I got news for @BarackObama . There is NO decent, honest, lawful politics in the Democratic party.
This was how @BarackObama led. I sure miss sanity pic.twitter.com/hsKoQEMjja
Shooter was just like Barack Obama - hated the Jews and Israel Israel. You're right, I like your logic better! @BarackObama sorry bro! Looks like this one's on you according to your supporters.
