Wow. Finally. Now will all the Democrats in our Congress who cozy up to him disavow him? I doubt it. The Dems are becoming more and more anti-Semitic, like @BarackObama .
@BarackObama @PutinRF_Eng
And @BarackObama gave them billion$$$ more to do more damage. Great job dip shit!!
This is a funny post. Fortunately for everyone the #racecard left when @BarackObama Hussein left office.
@BarackObama my all time favorite episode of ABPU...RIP @Bourdain
It is a good thing...Funny how stupid people don't realize we've been ripped off from almost every country we do business with..We are not the worlds ATM...Yes, I'm glad he won't bend over like @BarackObama did the 8 years in office...learn something before running your mouth
Strange that @BarackObama , the best president in my lifetime, could successfully kill Osama Bin Laden but, apparently, cannot successfully follow me, imo
You dare to say that to the Constitutionalists of America who lived through the unmitigated gaul and illegal behavior of . @BarackObama ??? #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp #FakeNews . @CNN
@BarackObama should invite the NBA champions to his place. I'm sure they would like to meet a real POTUS.
@cavs or @warriors winner and other Sports Champion , I think you all should visit @BarackObama and #43 until jackass is out of office.
@BarackObama we will remember you as the president that almost turned us into a third world country
To just hear his voice brought joy & light;-Every Sunday Anthony brought us the world--very Bittersweet moment when I recall him asking @BarackObama something like-"is everything going to be ok";-RIP, my Friend @TheLastWord @andersoncooper
I'm crying for both of you. @BarackObama We miss you. 65% of us don't want a cartoon president!
7 night shifts down. 5 night shifts to go. #SoBlessed #Yolo #Bae @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @Pontifex
I liked it better when Canada and the United States had @JustinTrudeau and @BarackObama . I miss those days.
Thanks @BarackObama for the good economy @realDonaldTrump can lie all he wants about the economy but we all know who's really responsible for it pic.twitter.com/Md1PrR8rIn
I feel like the day I meet @BarackObama I might cry
For kicks the team that wins should go to @BarackObama house for a BBQ and a pickup game.
I so love this episode This was a classic @BarackObama @Bourdain you will be sadly missed. SIP
@BarackObama it a happy life to remember our African friends, families and all the great things in our past... the steps to our routs is great but hard
@BarackObama WE MISS AND LOVE YOU, President O RIP Tony You'll be missed. pic.twitter.com/YnalBJyBHJ
@BarackObama We miss you in office. Can you convince Congress to change the Constitution to allow you to come back and then beat @realDonaldTrump in 2020? You're the best President we've had in decades. :(
Thank you Chuckie boy for continuing to spread the lies. You must be trying to take the title Liar In Chief from @BarackObama , good job Chuckie, good job....
Do you trust @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @dennisrodman or @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @JohnKerry to get peace in NK? Duh, those MAGA! @BarackObama and crew failed!
You're confused Sue. Your guy (the traitor @BarackObama ) needed a script.

I miss you @BarackObama
@BarackObama I look forward to an email from you. Nancy Balik at baliknancy@yahoo.com The office email is down.
@BarackObama @brhodes @TVietor08 @jonfavs @JoeBiden Comment?
No, I meant @BarackObama .
Out to dinner and @BarackObama casually walks in with his crew. The restaurant clapped. THANK YOU I CANT BELIEVE THIS
I miss @BarackObama and @MichelleObama sooo much.
We had @BarackObama once. Now we have nothing.
@BarackObama Antarctica
The traitor @BarackObama didn't want a good economy. That went against his agenda. Remember, "new normal" and "those jobs of the past are just not going to come back"? I do.
Dear @BarackObama . Our dear friend Pamela was unfairly suspended from Twitter I don't ask you to quote this tweet, but just a fav as a support. We miss her so much If you do it, I swear to vote democrat as soon as I have my citizenship. thanks #RendezNousPamelaChougne #Please
They win because of you. They didn't win when @BarackObama was president. You're such a better president...

@BarackObama the shadowhunters fandom needs your help, our favorite show got canceled and it's really important to us that someone saves it #SaveShadowhunters #SaveTheShadowWorld
Can we go back to a much simple time? Back before the world was so crazy and racist?! Can we have @BarackObama back now?!
just Like @BarackObama Too Funny for your Time? To Witty?
EXACTLY!!! That's why @BarackObama leaned so heavily on the word "fair"(became a drinking word for me during his speeches ) Everyone envisions something unique when they think about what is "fair"
Who's it gonna be? Our short list includes @BarackObama @Oprah @chucknorris and Dumbledore. http:// ow.ly/wC8v30kooUg
While I'm not a biggest fan of @BarackObama 's political legacy, can ya'll just take a moment to recognize this post isn't politcal, it is about the senseless loss of Anthony Bourdain. Please if you are suffering from depression, let someone know. Your life is worth it.
@BarackObama Mr. President you should throw a cookout and invite the @warriors and @Eagles !
Corrupt Obama...Shame on you. @BarackObama
@BarackObama Since the great orange one won't let invite them to the white house, will you invite the Warriors to your house after they win ANOTHER championship?
@realDonaldTrump added a huge corporate tax cut to the good economy @BarackObama handed him... Trump has put the economy in danger with Tariffs and bank deregulation which will cause a massive recession in 2020... #anotherbailout #SSmedicaidbankrupt
Did you bang @BarackObama too?
Why didn't you do something? you told Crimea/Ukraine if they got rid of nukes we'd protect them! You sir and then senator @BarackObama let them down! Time to #stepaside and let #grownups fix this @realDonaldTrump @potus @vp @StateDept
Thanks for teeing it up @BarackObama
@Barackobama May 10, 1998
Miss him already @BarackObama
@BarackObama shameful ! Shame shame shame ... xxl @netflix
@BarackObama Sir, we need you to come back...your country needs you to give us Hope again. #44forever
@BarackObama God if only we could put you back in the White House but after 8 amazing years I'm sure it put a toll on you and Michelle
Great news! Thank you to @POTUS for securing so many jobs for Hampton Roads! @BarackObama told us he had our back and was legit full of it. We will never forget the word #sequester that he taught us all too well. Obama lied to the 757 and used us ALL like pawns.
@dennisrodman has done more for American-Korean peace than @BarackObama , @GeorgeWBush , or @BillClinton combined! There, I said it. #Korean #Summit #NorthKorea
Seriously @SenMajLdr ??? Merrick Garland ring a bell? How about all the obstructing you did during the @BarackObama administration?
NAVY FOREVER! Thank you to @POTUS for securing so many jobs for Hampton Roads! @BarackObama told us he had our back and was legit full of it. We will never forget the word #sequester that he taught us all too well. Obama lied to the 757 and used us ALL like pawns.
What an amazing post, i hear, so here it is once more... Yes @BarackObama 's legacy is exquisite, classic and he was the best #president in our world history. Amen. pic.twitter.com/xipUsXzzp7
You first. Admit that @BarackObama picked up the economy from the ditch on the side of the road, where Bush and the @GOP left it at the end of 2007.
@BarackObama truth... pic.twitter.com/boDYkc97fV
@WAVY_News NEW SHIPYARD WORK!Thank you to @POTUS for securing so many jobs for Hampton Roads! @BarackObama told us he had our back and was legit full of it. We will never forget the word #sequester that he taught us all too well. Obama lied to the 757 and used us ALL like pawns.

Iran benefited in many ways during @BarackObama time usurping in our White House. A "lost drone" no assistance to the protesters in Iran when first elected, the Nuclear deal and the boatload of cash. They had a true friend for 8 miserable years.
I have to thank @BarackObama . I would not have survived the summer of 2014 had I not been able to get health ins. I did all the right things, reached out, had loved ones, but without sufficient and compassionate medical care, I would not have survived myself. #SuicidePrevention
I like how Anthony Bourdain humbled @BarackObama and had him sit lower than him on a stool as they ate noodles in the middle of Vietnam of all places since Barack thought he was above the law.
Looking at the #G7 and Mr. Trump's methodology, I can't help to think what I'd give to have @BarackObama back as our neighbour's leader.

@BarackObama When historians write a book about Obama, there will be no stories about cherry trees, being Self taught in a log cabin. THE chapters on the early years will be omitted. However it will be questioned on how the AMERICAN PEOPLE were so easily manipulated & deceived
. @BarackObama was liberal enough to drop more bombs than @GeorgeWBush But not enough to push for Medicare for all when both houses of Congress were D #nobelpeaceprize #DemExit

Hey #teddybear slow your roll, @BarackObama had over 1900 commutations and pardons
It's in the gracious and beautiful way people come together to make a difference for each other. That's @BarackObama legacy. He will be long remembered for the amazing president, husband, father, teacher, son, uncle, grandson and gracious human being. What else ya got?
Was just rewatching the episode of Parts Unknown he did with @BarackObama (Season 8, ep 1) on @Netflix . Better see it quick b/c it looks like the series is only on there just one more week (til 6/15)
@BarackObama Great Mr. President, you are down to earth and some of us appreciate your humility and love for all is what you cherish most. Bourdain experienced that as well, he can rest in peace.

How can ObamaCare even be an issue when @BarackObama is documented usurper of the United States Constitution? Ignoring his exposed history is no excuse for allowing him to escape our laws. @TheJusticeDept & our @FBI is embarrassing our blind Lady Justice.
Quick question... Constitutionally, what are the duties of the president? @BarackObama
I miss you too @BarackObama
@BarackObama gave them $150B US Tax Payer Dollars...why?
Dude, @BarackObama is paying his respect. Go play with your basket of #Deplorables .
The United Nations Secretary General should immediately send a commission to the wings that can be found in the meeting with the people. @manzoorpashteen @PakhtunR @AWGoraya @salmanmasood @Aliwazirna41 @BarackObama
President @BarackObama you said you would still actively participate in helping to stop any policy changes you felt would dramatically hurt the American people. Please call us to the streets to protest these insane changes. https:// nyti.ms/2JnJoOd
So @BarackObama was legitimate too? #nevertoolatetosayyouresorry
Alice Johnson's family asked @barackobama to pardon her three times. Sorry, no, I have some real criminals to pardon -- 300+ and a few terrorists as well. But @realDonaldTrump is the racist? Please people, wake up. pic.twitter.com/WZDQUz0upj
@BarackObama I will miss him. Taught us a lot about culture and others lifetimes. RIP
