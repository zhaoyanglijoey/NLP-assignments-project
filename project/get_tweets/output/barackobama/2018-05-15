@BarackObama I am passionately pro-life, disagree with you on many fronts (passionately) However, I passionately MISS YOU. Our country has become that seedy convenience store on the corner that has the dirty, foul smelling restroom, and the clerk with snot dripping from his nose.

It's a pretty sad state of affairs that I feel like I can't follow the President or administration officials on #SocialMedia . I could always follow W. and @BarackObama , but it's frightening how hateful the current #POTUS & his supporters can be.

We have proof that @BarackObama had surveillance on @realDonaldTrump as early as 2013 and shared classified information with Eric @schneiderman . Eric Schneiderman sued Trump literally 2 days after the Obama/Schneiderman meeting. Corrupt as the day is long these people.

@BarackObama I hope that the law suit that is going to be filed against Trump is not a threat. I hope it happens. We can see now that the American people have a price for Trump. I think he has sold them out for much lower. Heck maybe even for a compliment to boost his ego.

Because @BarackObama had 8 years to solve this problem and only emboldened NK and Iran? There is zero doubt @POTUS knows 10x more about foreign policy than that bloviating community organizer.

Are you on drugs? Seriously, lay off the mushrooms. @realDonaldTrump has accomplished more in a year then @BarackObama did in eight. Any anything he has yet to accomplish is only due to your obstruction. Get a grip cry baby #swamp
Hear #poet @ProfessorEA read a powerful #poem at @BarackObama 's inauguration in 2009: https:// youtu.be/_vLBnFk-OFc BHS is excited to welcome her & fellow celebrated poet @Deardarkness for a fascinating conversation TOMORROW night. Don't miss it! http:// bit.ly/2Hl9mB0

How EFFING surprising (said no one ever). Drumph purposely causes chaos upon chaos so we won't notice all the true evil he's doing. More than anything, I hate what he's done to @BarackObama whom I love & miss so much. Obama did so much good. Drumph? The opposite.
You mean @BarackObama should return his Nobel Peace Prize for starting a war instead of ending one.
Under cover of late responses. #Fishnets place, Sundowner caught with jumbuck, in tucker bag, would have thrown himself in Billabong. If matriarch hadn't provided apron to cover under, during @BarackObama investigation. #DictatorTonyBlair , removed guilty link,from circulation
Love @POTUS more each day. I can't remember feeling this for any politician. He's not a politician. He's my President. You can piss/moan,but guess what?he's @BarackObama @HillaryClinton President too! I'm loving it! #qanon #GreatAwakening #TrustGod pic.twitter.com/YFXyl1orNf
This tweet should have gotten them suspended @Twitter @TwitterSupport . Why are they not shadow banned. Referring to lillimere. Is it because one of their followers is @BarackObama ? CC: @FoxNews pic.twitter.com/pAas5TJvn9
Who could see @BarackObama , barring a national emergency, allowing @MichelleObama to go through surgery and recovery without him being there? #trump #FLOTUS
That would be like me trolling all over the world illegally w/no clearance--where are Kushs' cuffs& indictments? @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG
. @HawleyMO is to the left of @BarackObama on gun control which makes him not much different than @CoryBooker or @clairecmc I'm with @AP4Liberty

God Bless @realDonaldTrump the media will do and say anything to boost their hate agenda against Trump. I mean he succeeded in doing what @BarackObama & his predecessors promised to do but they are spreading propaganda about Israel just to lynch him. Pathetic!!
"Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek." Via @BarackObama #TuesdayMotivation
@BarackObama FYI Antonio Villaraigosa flyers for Governor make it look like you endorse him for CA Governor. Teachers endorsed Gavin Newsom. Flyers from Reed Hastings, Eli Broad and Michael Bloomberg.
@GeorgeWBush__ @BillClinton @BarackObama as you can see it ONLY took 26 years for a President to keep his promises unlike you TRAITORS! #MAGA Thank you for your commitment to hard work and honesty @realDonaldTrump

. @chucktodd on . @MSNBC acts like some Dems calling for impeachment could be anti-American. Are you kidding me Todd? If . @BarackObama did only 1 of the hundreds of actions like . @realDonaldTrump did the whole . @GOP would be up in arms yelling #impeachment HYPOCRISY at its finest.
@GOP are complicit with Papaya Pol Pot regime's corruption. Their true colors are now clear to all: GOP Party & Power over Country. The Constitutional obscenity of stealing @BarackObama 's SCOTUS pick revealed the depth of @GOP hypocrisy & decrepitude. Vote out all GOP!
What's it gonna take @ConawayTX11 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP I know I asked one n person last yr Watch Video what do the all say? Bbut @BarackObama @HillaryClinton #ByTheirFruitYouWillRecognizeThem GoodvsEvil As @MichaelAvenatti says #Basta https:// youtu.be/vq_EKSx0mR4

Hey @ShaunKing has @BarackObama come out against the acts of Israel yesterday as of yet?....Im asking this in all seriousness.
Please don't forget that your hero, @BarackObama stated he would move the embassy to Jerusalem too....would you have felt the same way then? Loser
How about forming a coalition to stop the election hacking Obama? @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG
No other president wanted to solve the NK crisis we have now possibly for this reason and more: @BarackObama and others didn't wanna look like a fool and embarrass themselves like Trump did. Trump is too gullible. #KimJongUn seen right threw him. #NobelPeacePrize revoked!
. @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton greatest achievements Made war fashionable made dems lose their critical thinking skills bc their king/queen are perfect gave our economy to the banks/monopolies gave us trump
On days like these is when I miss @BarackObama the most
