@BarackObama did you ever think KU would be in the final four?
What the hell would @GOP have done if @StormyDaniels was talking about @BarackObama during his admin? Exactly.
The president supported by the leaders of #evangelical America, who attacked scandal-free @BarackObama as if he was the anti-Christ, had a porn star spank him then told her she reminded him of his daughter. #StormyDanielsDay #NotMyJesus
@BarackObama why do you follow @pissass ?
@Barackobama May 11, 1998
@BarackObama well I took advice from my Dad in the 50's. He said college championships are hard due to these are young kids & it is the team who plays the hardest to win even as good as another team is. So he said Jackie wait till the finals to pick your team.
That's true, Mr. President @BarackObama , but what about the Jayhawks? Rock Chalk!!
@BarackObama shut up!!! You are no longer relevant!
. @barackobama @potus44 didn't have a porn star problem. #60Minutes
But do you think @BarackObama would have used tariff war in this situation?
Pres @BarackObama praises the March for Our Lives student organizers: "This was all because of the courage, and effort of a handful of 15-, 16-year olds." (via ABC) pic.twitter.com/9RBgBbGNo7
We WERE marching when Clinton, Bush and Obama was president. When we did march, it didn't make a change. I remember when we tried to impeach @BarackObama and nothing happened.
Just saw "13 Hours" @BarackObama @HillaryClinton How could you? Whores!
@BarackObama The courageous kids marching yesterday were raised under your Presidency. They are a part of your legacy that will live on for *many* years to come. Thank you for being such a good example to them and to us all.
@BarackObama @JoeBiden What say you???? pic.twitter.com/SpB589zTI4
That's compassion @BarackObama .
Do you think alleging that @BarackObama is a Pedophile may end up with the same results?? You don't think your tweets through enough. And as you may or may not be able to tell I'm not here to make friends. #DonTheCon #MAGAts #AsDumbAsABot #Pay4PLAYmates #BoughtBot

I miss @BarackObama ... he has the best humor
Boy, if @BarackObama had one of the 100,000 accusations Trump has, I wonder how the media/Republicans/people would treat him? #Ijs #StormyDanielsDay
@CNN @AnaCabrera @CNNnewsroom @AmyKremer Economically @realDonaldTrump is terrible.If left to @BarackObama it would have been continuing higher.Cities are turning to ghost towns. Larger cities stepping back, not growing.Not to mention @realDonaldTrump breaching marriage contract.

Hey @BarackObama , how do you feel about this...???
@Twitter @BarackObama #60minutes Altho I used 2b a fan of @realDonaldTrump b4 he ran, he has bcom greatest personification of #WallSt meets #KStreet /WashDC, &the Libs pathetic attempts 2fool us that theyre any diff. We hav2 change conversations frm Dems vs Repubs 2 Us vs Them!..
u cant b serious..at least we have reason 4 it, he did this 2 himself, this wasnt conditioned over time, or delivered by partisan outlets 2 make us feel this way, unlike the right towards @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama who didnt deserve 2b treated the way theyve been treated pic.twitter.com/Z9XOUH2yms

In regards to my last post, I refuse to believe that @BarackObama is a real human. But rather a collective hallucination

Back in 2008, one of the best moments of my life happened. It was at a political rally in my city known as Columbia, Missouri. I was behind the railing where the candidates would walk in to give their speech. I shook hands with the man who became the 44th president @BarackObama
I see @BarackObama talking about #MarchMadness and congratulating @RamblersMBB like a normal human being... then his successor spouts this nonsense. I'm glad I'm not the insane one here for being baffled by this...I'd love to ask him "why are you the way that you are?"
@BarackObama seriously, it's your fault! your killing me!
@BarackObama @JoeBiden @MichelleObama Need to help GET OUT THE VOTE for for 2018. Dems NEED to take over the HOUSE and SENATE!!

Nice plug for @BarackObama . Thanks, Tomi! Sure miss having a real president!
Question: Where was #MarchForOurLives at when #SandyHook happened under @BarackObama ? Was it because he was a democrat? The liberal biased in this country is beyond sickening and the brainwashing just keeps happening.
Omg god help us all #WakeUpAmerica #WeThePeople MUST AND WILL #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #GreatAwakening @BarackObama
I wish @BarackObama could have been president forever...
@BarackObama My Brother's Keeper Initiative & Urban Prep High Schools nationwide would be a good place to start cultivating the million #BarackObamas -
How true, Wendy! But it would have been wishful thinking-Obama never would have had a mistress. We once had a president, @BarackObama who was a family man with dignity, class and good morals. Those days are gone. We have trash in the White House now, in more ways than one.
As the @GOP & 45's supporters criticize #MSD students, it's more noteworthy that former President @BarackObama & Mrs. @MichelleObama had tweeted support and encouragement to the @AMarch4OurLives . On Palm Sunday, @Pontifex encouraged young people to keep speaking truth to power.
@BarackObama Read about your Japanese Trip. You are a good man. Your heart is in the right place and you do your best to make the world a better place.

@BarackObama You are a Muslim and a traitor.
. @barackobama was the most progressive president since JFK & FDR. How effective was he against guns via Congress? After #Dunblane private handguns were banned in mainland Britain. To not fade away as others before you, start a new conversation w/the American people not Congress.

@BarackObama Are you still watching, Mr. President? I'm hoping Kansas can pull this out. I love that you do a bracket
@realDonaldTrump is just trying to figure out a way to blame @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton before he lets putin flip the switch.
Just a reminder that President @BarackObama went two terms without a scandal. #StormyDanielsDay
the drama of it all once you notice that @FLOTUS is following @realDonaldTrump , @POTUS , @VP , @SecondLady ... and motherfucking @BarackObama

@BarackObama did a great job at gutting the VA.
@barackobama The Clown!
When the media came at @MichelleObama @BarackObama always covered & stood up for her. One reason the media feels so comfortable disrespecting Melania is b/c of her husband's lack of respect for her.
