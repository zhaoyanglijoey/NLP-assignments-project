And while you are bending over thanking a man who is taking credit for which @BarackObama did most of the work, let us pause and take a moment to look at some of @realDonaldTrump 's more notorious accomplishments. pic.twitter.com/50lZ9nR0gl
Thank you @BarackObama ! That "Obama Bump" is chugging away! But your Unfunded Tax Cuts only led to stagnant wages, Countless Stock Buybacks that Inflate Value with ZERO REAL Market Gains, a Student Loan Bubble & Stale housing Starts, and with less regulation = imminent CRASH!!!
Yes! Maybe look at our previous president @BarackObama what a disgrace!
Thank you President @BarackObama
Yeah thanks for rolling over @BarackObama budget so it can .

Not because of you. You picked up where President @BarackObama left.
When @JamesClapper (DNI) and @JohnBrennan (CIA) discovered that ADM Mike Rogers (NSA) had reported their activities to then President-Elect @realDonaldTrump , they immediately went to @BarackObama and asked that Rogers be fired.

Thank you @BarackObama for leading this country out of the worst recession since the great depression, A recession created by the gop.
Why not when @BarackObama was party to the soft coup against you?
@nytimes Your article is misleading. In the last 4 years of @BarackObama , an average of 213 K jobs/mo were added; in the 1st 16 mo of @realDonaldTrump , 189 K jobs/mo added. Under BO, S&P up average of 30.3/mo; under DT, that average is 20.5/mo. Economy just continuing to improve
Thanks @BarackObama can see the republican's are being snakes still
Both @MSNBC & @cnn have mentioned #impeach in the past month more than they mentioned #RadicalIslam since @BarackObama was elected. Still haven't found either mention #rape & @BillClinton in the same sentence. #Presstitutes #FakeNewsMedia #MAGA

@BarackObama & Trump are both corporatist neoliberal globalists. So are @@MMFlint , Robert @RBReich , Hillary Clinton, & the whole Democratic & Republican Parties. In Canada, Conservatives, Liberals, NDP & Greens are all neoliberal. Get it?
Would've been a far better America and less racial tension had senator @SenJohnMcCain been elected! I don't agree on all his politics but he is a good man. I respect McCain not because of him standing up for @BarackObama ! I respect McCain for being a kind man.

MAGA crowd was @BarackObama crowd before Trump. You realize that? Same people who hoped for change w/Obama, but got none, then voted for Trump. A lot of them were also Bernie supporters. So, you're smearing anyone who wants change from the neoliberal agenda that you promote.
@BarackObama Presidency Was A Big Mistake, VOTERS didn't do their Homework/Research on this IMPOSTOR. Obama = DEVIL, THAT'S WHY THERE WAS PEDOPHILES/SPIRIT COOKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. SPREAD THE WORD. VOTE RED, VOTE REPUBLICAN
@POTUS told the truth when he said @BarackObama had ordred Trump Towers to be wire-tapped. Former NSA Dir. ADM Mike Rogers made an unofficial visit to @realDonaldTrump in Nov. 2016 (shortly after the election) to brief & alert him to these actions by the @FBI , @DNC & Fusion GPS.
US healthcare is already a fascist mess of excessive government regulation. @BarackObama tried to make healthcare an entirely government business and failed disastrously on every promise he made.
Why do you think @realDonaldTrump is pressuring him so hard? Sessions hired John Huber to investigate all things Clinton and dossier because he recused himself. Not a word. John Huber was appointed by @BarackObama
@JohnBrennan hey Brennan you moron, you forgot the biggest disaster in American history.... @BarackObama
I miss @BarackObama
I create statues of @BarackObama in my toilet
Thank you @BarackObama
Thank you @BarackObama . A real POTUS.
Just remember #Outsiders , @BarackObama said 'you can't wave a magic wand, those jobs are gone' however @realDonaldTrump did exactly that and the jobs that once left the #USA are actually returning and flourishing again.. go figure #AusPoll
Thank you @BarackObama
Thanks again @BarackObama ! Your recovery keeps chugging along. At least until @realDonaldTrump screws it up.

I did notice John's eulogy will be by @BarackObama . I don't know if John was feeling very well recently, Cancer treatment is harsh! John vs Obama in the 2008 elections. Understanding someone in a similar situation to yours is easier. John and Trump. Not much interaction.
Let's say @BarackObama hauled a very heavy luggage from the basement of a 50 storey building & drops it at the door of the penthouse suit,all Trump had to do was get the luggage from the door to the living room.Who would u say did all the work ?Fools like @GOP would say Trump
I forgave @SenJohnMcCain 's foibles when he stepped up as A Caring Human Being... in defense of Pres @BarackObama , with that poor ignorant (stupid) Older Woman calling him an Arab. Go with Peace & Love in your Heart, John.
@realDonaldTrump can only claim 20 months of the bull market. The remainder belongs to @BarackObama who brought it out of a deep recession to the road to recovery.

#Democrats talking about deficit? Ask @BarackObama how he managed to mess up the USA healthcare system while adding trillions to our deficit
@BarackObama bowed to them, then apologized to them for America being brutes and mean. Are you kidding. Do you know any facts. Probably not. He also allowed brutal dictators and terrorists to continue their ways around the world. Terrorism gained strength while he was in office.
@BarackObama currently the right wing elements are sowing division among the people of South Africa i miss the voice of reasoning from the proponents of democracy like @BarackObama

The main thing is that @BarackObama wasn't the right color, in the eyes of the #ReTHUGlucan party, so they can never, ever think of him as anything but the devil. Feels good to be so full of racism and bigotry, right @realDonaldTrump ? #TrumpRussia #MuellerTimeIsNear
A strong economy thanks to @BarackObama . Remember it took 4-6 years for Bush to blow through the surplus Clinton left him. If trump stays full term, it will spell disaster for our economy. We need to get him out with a Democrat conquered congress after 2018 midterms. pic.twitter.com/DjWzWlcZZ9

absolute, unquestionable dedication to this country! I did not vote for your for President, I voted for @BarackObama & one of the deciding factors in that was I just COULD NOT vote for @SarahPalinUSA to be VP! In my view, she might have been as bad, or almost as bad as....
This started in 2010 under Obama... Trump is presiding over President Obama's record run and has only been around for a little over a year and a half of it. So most of this is high praise for President Obama by the GOP. thanks! And thank you President Obama!! @BarackObama

Obama proudly embraced Reagan. You know that, right? That's why Dr. @CornelWest referred to Obama as a Rockefeller Republican. @BarackObama was a good friend to Wall Street. So, I don't understand why you're defending him. Dem=GOP. Got that?
That's like your hero Ruth Bader Ginsburg after Scalia was killed, and you wanted to rush to give the seat to the evil @BarackObama going on what a "good friend" Scalia was to her. @USSupremeCourt should not have allowed this to happen to Scalia. Yeah, that's right.

The economy is worse than it was under @BarackObama . fewer jobs are being created, wages have fallen. That is the truth. Even his spectacular GDP growth was better under @BarackObama . He has had more people plead guilty or be indicted than Obama, I'll give you that.

John McCain has already stated publicly that DT is not to come to his funeral. It would be the height of poor manners if any member of the Trump crime family attends. @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton will represent the people of the US when the sad comes. They are legitimate.
Accurate numbers, eh? Well, the record-breaking bull market took place thusly; 83% prior to Jan 2017, 17% subsequent to @realdonaldtRUmp assuming office. BTW President @BarackObama was born in Hawaii. Even your "dear leader" gave up on that one.
@SenJohnMcCain Actually had respect for @BarackObama despite disagreement on policy.
@BarackObama Fue.muy.Buen presidente.y.puedey.gana...
If you are a big @BarackObama supporter then you probably do not believe the dem party is corrupt & you probably believe russia duped us.
The actual results on the hourly rates of the US workforce are declining wages as inflation outpaces wages And monthly job creation that is lagging behind @BarackObama job growth

Watching 13 Hours Secret Soldiers of Benghazi on FX. Reminds me of what a disgrace @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton are, and what heros @KrisParonto , Woods, Doherty & the other soldiers are. Obama left them to die with no support. F16 QRF told to stand down, no Gunships or Soldiers

@BarackObama @ObamaNews The we tortured some folks in the US after 9/11 truth because they published the Mar 11, 2011 #costliest natural disaster ever epicenter 1000x in 11 languages before it cost a quarter trillion @"June 15, 1896" epicenter so Dec 26, 2004 looked more natural
What about all of @BarackObama 's White House meetings with Mark Zuckerberg and #Facebook ?
Thanks, @BarackObama
Hope @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama are watching 13 Hours on FX today! I am........ #neverforgetBenghazi
They imported all these refugees and now these refugees will rule over them! Unbelievable! Thanks to @BarackObama and to the globalist @GeorgeWBush

A bit late on your blab. @BarackObama isn't in office anymore.
Thanks to @BarackObama handing off a healthy economy on 2016. Please stop telling lies.
What the woman meant to say was that @BarackObama was a #Muslim not an #Arab ; however she was too ignorant to know that the majority of Muslims are NOT Arab. #JohnMcCain should not be celebrated for being decent, it should be expected from every elected representative of the US.
