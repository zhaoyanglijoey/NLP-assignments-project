When is @realDonaldTrump going to apologize to @BarackObama and the family of @SenJohnMcCain
@Barackobama May 10, 1998
@BarackObama hi I miss you plz come back
it's not even Trump. it's since the GOP started progressively taking over governors, senate, house and the Presidency because @Barackobama started empowering silicon valley socialists. Extremely Liberal = Socialist tendencies. America cannot stand socialism, hates it! wake up.
i love @BarackObama

Please compare the starting line for both Presidents. @BarackObama inherited a Republican mess, @realDonaldTrump inherited a growing economy. I hope for Americans he does better with this inheritance than he did with his personal inheritance.
@BarackObama we miss you
Watching @Jeopardy and the answer was @BarackObama and shed a tear. When I hear his name, I still stop and cry that he is not the President. How can this Country have climbed so high and then fallen so far with @realDonaldTrump ?
SURE! Right after . @BarackObama releases his school records.

Now that's what I'm talking about. But as a POC I didn't speak up loudly till @BarackObama was elected. Living under a cloud, much like you. And this is how POWER controls the narrative. But no more.

information and communications. Including many of wikia leaks from #Vault7 information dump last around 2017. Which led to us knowing that #HillaryAndBarry knew of the hacks in the servers, on the #DNC party from both #China (potentially), and #Russia . Because @BarackObama spoke
Your side did this to President @BarackObama , Hillary Clinton, Senator Warren, etc. I completely agree this is unacceptable. Please clean your own house first then come complaining if the other side is following your lead.
Do they have rabies? Mob mentality/group think alone isn't the only thing going on here.Hereby requesting @BarackObama , @HillaryClinton , @MaxineWaters , @chuckschumer , @timkaine to speak out against this & calm these people down since you started & encouraged this. It's unhealthy.

#TheFive #MondayMotivation #DemocratsAreEvil #WalkAway #DemocratsAreViolent #WakeUpAmerica Remember when @BarackObama told his supporters to "Get in their faces" of their relatives at Thanksgiving Dinner ...... THIS IS THE VIOLENT NATURE OF THE LEFT ! pic.twitter.com/oqBoUVJRBw
Thx to @DOJgov & @RobertMueIIer for proving beyond all doubt that @DNC , @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama all colluded w/ @KremlinRussia_E albeit unsuccessfully. VOTE REPUBLICAN!
You can not be for real. Attack on school lunches?? Making USDA lunches better to include veggies is an attack? OK. @BarackObama didn't do a very good job destroying the middle class: here we are. "PC" just means taking others' feelings into consideration: we teach children that.
@BarackObama Check out a new non-political book on race that doesn't turn to the left or the right. Search Amazon for -- Off the Race Track Simms. Thanks.
Hey @JZarif , F*k you and your European BBFs, come on then.... you never said how much that #JCPOA cost Iranian people to get it agreed, you said you were going to tell all.....but you never did. Just tell us what was @JohnKerry & @BarackObama 's cut, come on let's have it! #Iran
@BarackObama will you and all the other world influencers please speak up on the impeding #ClimateCrisis . We are nearly out of time
OK, new argument...2. I am a veteran and I am so happy that @POTUS signed the Veteran's act allowing people at the VA to get fired, under @BarackObama (and Bush/Clinton/etc) they had to die or retire. 3. Where is your outrage @keithellison - Need more info on #1 please #MAGA
@SenateGOP @SenateDems @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton @BarackObama i`m just..................................................................SKorean make me crazy.
If the Democratic Establishment wants to unify the resistance, then: @HillaryClinton will campaign with @SenSanders all over the country @BarackObama will endorse @Ocasio2018 and other young progressives "Shut up and vote" is not a winning message. Symbols of unity are needed.

@DanaPerino @JesseBWatters The division of the country has existed since @BarackObama was Pres. Difference is now @realDonaldTrump is President & the media is creating a narrative that the division has happened since 2016 election. Media didn't report until met the narrative.

@TheFive Please tell @TheJuanWilliams that the division exploded when @BarackObama told the Cambridge, MA Police acted stupidly which was a stupid comment to make. @greggutfeld @DanaPerino @jesse_b_waters
As you can see @BarackObama track record is what @realDonaldTrump is continuing. @BarackObama was fixing the problem Bush created. Unemployment predictions all indicate will go up before 2020 elections when @realDonaldTrump policy take effect. pic.twitter.com/Ej0OMGBnIX
@TheJuanWilliams @BarackObama MR. WILLIAMS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN DIVIDE UNTIL OBAMA GOT ELECTED. SORRY BUT HE WAS A COP-HATING RACIST. AND THAT'S HOW YOU TALK TOO. REWRITING HISTORY? BOY DID YOU GET SMACKED DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE A TOKEN ON THE FIVE.
I remember @BarackObama took his bust out of the #whotehouse and @realDonaldTrump brought it back
For those that don't know much about #ValerieJarret let's go back to this article in 2008 that exposed her as the "slumlord millionaire" and her ties to @BarackObama What happened to all that money? @JudicialWatch was on it then and some of us tried to warn. @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/YChPNu5nPS
Only because GWB, & @BarackObama Treasury printed so much.......
This video might be rare, but if you read @BarackObama 's first autobiography, he is quite candid about such incidents as a teenager. In 2006 he released an audio-book version for which he won a Grammy! Maybe you need to read, listen & travel more - particularly outside the USA.
We survived 8 long years of an American hater named Hussein. If a white guy had done 1/2 the mess @BarackObama did, he'd been drawn & quartered. Only thing saved him he hid behind "don't challenge me or you'll be called RACIST". I'm black & no one can call me racist against BHO.
Most divisive president ever @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/1qyrJODRw5
You can thank @TheDemocrats @RepMaxineWaters @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris @BarackObama @SenSchumer @pelosi for the shooting of Republicans, the harassing of Republicans. This is going to stop with only removing the Democrats from any political office.
I HIGHLY recommend @GenFlynn book #FieldOfFight . He has 33 yrs. of Military Intelligence. @BarackObama was openly hostile towards Israel, while @realDonaldTrump proclaimed Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. @POTUS listened to our BRILLIANT military leaders such as @GenFlynn pic.twitter.com/FdLtydLNcH
@LadiesGOP Even @David_Cameron asked @BarackObama to have now @SenKamalaHarris shut these people down. However, the CEO (a British expat) is part of the untouchable California Democrat donor class; therefore nothing was done. Feel free to investigate. http:// chn.ge/2BTUurl
30 year plan? So you're saying that your savior @BarackObama was in on it too? Thats funny.
When #ColinPowell sees his retirement saving fund increases 10 folds this past 2 years, he needs to call Trump and thank him on booming economy and low taxes. Trump is definitely #AmericaFirst = We the (American) people" President. Unlike me..me..me @BarackObama
Nevermind the @UFC . I'd pay to see @BarackObama go 3 rds with @realDonaldTrump .
I miss you @BarackObama !! Come back to us!!! pic.twitter.com/CbYiNP5rjV
Don't have to imagine, that's what we had with Obama. Thank God We the American People voted for Donald Trump!!! History will not be kind to @BarackObama or @HillaryClinton I am thinking. #MAGA #RedTsunami2018
And one of the biggest that brought us back to where we are today is @BarackObama

Yes. Take that @BarackObama !

And you takink you got a lot off big solutions during 8 years of @BarackObama and @GovMarkDayton ? There's diff between speach and actually delivering what you speak.

Can we all just agree there's only one reason Trumpsters believe @BarackObama was the worst president ever. Whether you know it or not...it's race. Even if you hated the ACA the bought is out of the depths of the rescession, plain and simple.
@BarackObama MJ or Lebron?
Oh my goodness to have a NO drama, real #President again! #President @BarackObama for a THIRD term please, #America
why did @BarackObama run for a second term when he could not deliver hope and change.. ? he got used to the tax payer paid affluence and is still enjoying it and will do so for the rest of his life.. same goes for other living POTUSes.. except Jimmy..
BTW This is Berta Griffin's facebook page where she shows the @BarackObama endorsement. Don't know more than that.

Oh BTW here is @BarackObama s handle... Got any Class A stuff on how the man was born in Kenya, would be an awesome follow up to your Warren tweet.....

Russia is benefiting greatly because of the Republican's trade war. They have increased their exports to China since it started. So Putin is benefiting from Trump's decisions on trade. @GermanyDiplo @francediplo_EN @BarackObama @jeanmarcayrault

? He didn't take the reigns of the sinking ship! @BarackObama did. While I'm no liberal, credit for this burgeoning economy begins with him. Problem is, nobody wants to deal with what's KEEPING it going...TRILLION $ deficits! #unsustainable
Again- remember how controversial @BarackObama was with his Dijon mustard requests and tan suits? God I miss him and @MichelleObama

This means that a conglomeration of IMUS child sex offenders, most of them black men or black FTM transgenders such as Eric Abdulazeez, controlled @barackobama and his former @whitehouse sub-office. To answer the question as to which black folks were in power recently.
This has to burn @BarackObama .
@MitchMcConnell would not even meet with President @BarackObama nomination. And today hes flippimg, he will for traitor Trump. They call ptotesters the Mob when its the republicans who is screwing americans EVERY chance they get.
Towards the end, @barackobama Esme was under the thumb of Eric Abdulazeez. Between April 2013 until August 2018, Abdulazeez generally called the shots and @barackobama followed. That meant that the real power in the black Arab community was IMUS Network.
