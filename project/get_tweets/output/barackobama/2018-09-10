Well, almost. More accurately, it's like @BarackObama kept the lid turning for 8 years. He reversed years of clockwise torque under Bush II so as to leave his successor with one task...lift.
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama In 2016 Obama said, "Trump would need a majic wand to get 4% GDP growth". GOT NEWS FOR YA OBAMA, LAST QTR. PRESIDENT TRUMP USED HIS BRAINS TO GET 4.2% GDP GROWTH!!! YOU OBAMA, WAS THE FIRST PRES. TO NOT GET 3% SINCE HOOVER!
@BarackObama I remember when you said this. So does the rest of the world......
We know @BarackObama lied about his status to go to Occidental claiming he was a foreign student.
@BarackObama Started It.
It is hysterical that you feel the need to have adulation...you will NEVER be as good as him...he has you beat on EVERY front, popular, charismatic, genuine, trustworthy, honorable. You are pond scum. @BarackObama we love him.
@BarackObama abracadabra brotha sucka.
The comments being directed at @realDonaldTrump are nothing compared to the racist, bigoted, lies that the @GOP directed at @BarackObama during his presidency. Trump remains a #SerialLiar and is a disgrace to our nation.

I do not think that when President Trump promised to "Make America Great Again" he was referring to the disastrous @BarackObama years! pic.twitter.com/v55jjC031S
apparently Chuck.. not true... have you listened to @BarackObama lately... HE is the reason for the booming economy, for NKorea coming to the table, for the demise of ISIS, ,... and he calls @realDonaldTrump a narcissist..

Because of @BarackObama ... You just took credit for his work. Your legacy will go down as the worst presidency ever who divided our country. Congratulations!
@BarackObama I wish you where still the President of the United States. Trump has messed up so many things. Including our health care. Now people like myself that live with chronic pain. Have been cut off of the medication that helped us have some quality of life.
When exactly did @BarackObama said this? Provide the source. Had you inherited the economy Obama inherited from Bush we would all be on soup lines.
Makes me want to scream - but as @BarackObama would say - "don't scream - vote!"
@BarackObama is a total zero. Not one accomplishment in eight years worth note. Biggest empty suit in history of the office .
Love love love @BarackObama . An inspiring individual like-minded people aspire to. His kind and thoughtful and he cares for all Americans. His giving Americans HOPE again!
@BarackObama stated as fact on video, fact check if you wish, there was no way of creating jobs unless @POTUS had a magic wand, now the jobs are there, he is trying to jump on the #TrumpTrain and make it his own, @BarackObama had nothing to do with the economy of 2018 fact.
Yeah #DictatorO @BarackObama never pushed division and hate, right? The left is so divisive, hateful and racist beyond belief while accusing others of the same. You are a sad little man.

Here's what @BarackObama did to get the economy booming, credit was frozen so he gave out loans and grants as part of the recovery act this was not a 1 year thing they were handed out over years to help the economy @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @wsj @cnbc @nytimes @history @BreitbartNews

@BarackObama blamed Bush for the economy he "inherited". Will he now attempt to take credit for @realDonaldTrump economy for the rest of Trump's term. Pathetically Sad! @charliekirk11
It will be as though @BarackObama never existed....glorious!
#911Neverforget brought to you by #islam the religion of #tolerance and #peace as said by @BarackObama and George Bush
The bottom line is @BarackObama was President when Americans died at Bengazhi, because he abandoned them. He wants to rewrite history. He lied about the attack and did nothing to rescue those Americans.Their blood will forever be on his hands.He was Commander in Chief of America
I guess @BarackObama got under ur thin skin after his speech last week!

So Barack Obama wants to open up a Benghazi Can of Worms ? @BarackObama He better be prepared to get hit with both barrels !
Same economic trends as @BarackObama then gave rich poeple a shit ton of money. They and Them appriciate it I'm sure.

Only thing @BarackObama did was purposely limit growth of the economy in his 2cnd term, setting the stage for @realDonaldTrump to come in and fix it. Once he did, the economy roared to where it could have been with someone that encouraged American exceptionalism, not trashed it

@BarackObama You are a real piece of shit. Always knew it. How dare you insult the memories of lost lost in Benghazi.
Do research. For the most part, 45 is taking credit for a lot of President Obama's achievements. I dread seeing what will happen as 45 continues to screw with everything. Look back to the end of Bush Junior's term. @BarackObama is #1
Why be so petty and deceptive about everything? Admit the truth: @BarackObama had 76 straight months of growth and four times had better months and your best. More jobs were gained in his last 19 months than your 1st 19. Those are facts, not petty lies of an insecure fool.
I did. I thanked him for showing America what #Democrats do to our economy and having voters switch to a successful businessman who knew what to do. But we needed a socialist to destroy us before people figured it out. Thanks @BarackObama , you da beta male.
Thanks! Man, I still miss @BarackObama .
What you did was take great @BarackObama economic plan with steady growth then steal 1.5 Trillion from US Treasury creating a debt that is by CBO score a death nell in 2028! Now @HouseGOP @SenateGOP want to rob Social Security Medicare to pay it down before USA money is worthless
Thank you for making that happen @BarackObama

Read your own tweet. 95 consecutive months! Trump has been in office 20 months. Do the math (though obviously you suck at math). That means the first 75 months was under @BarackObama Can you at least admit that and stop lying to the people. pic.twitter.com/dObDJErfjq
This utterly ignored the facts. @BarackObama 's administration saved us from a possible depression (from Bush's economic actions). By the end of Obama's time in office, the economy was doing really well. That is plenty of data available if you just cared to avail yourself of it.
Thanks @BarackObama .
