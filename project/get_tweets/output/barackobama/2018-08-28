Pretty much, yes. But they want government to fix what ails them. You know the @realDonaldTrump "You won't be ignored!" speech. Oh, @BarackObama was the same; a classier dude, but still a nanny.

I served in the Army under Obama @MarkDice I was a liberal back than. I even followed Young Turks. Now that I'm out and I was shown just how God awful he was as a president, I still took pride in knowing I still served him honorably. Too bad @BarackObama never served me the same.
@BarackObama is the only president since Nixon who didn't face an independent investigation. @realDonaldTrump http:// read.bi/2yJ95nW via @businessinsider

Watching #thirteenhours and remembering how much of a piece of shit @BarackObama , @HillaryClinton , @JoeBiden and everyone in that administration was and still are. Letting Americans die because they didn't want to let know that they had a secret @CIA base in #Benghazi . Fuck you.
Thanks @BarackObama
@BarackObama Why Barack did you leave the greatest president ever leave him in such a mess?

Yeah, you're right... @BarackObama and @BillClinton and @43georgebush did screw things up with getting #NAFTA going. But thank Heaven that your and my @POTUS .... @realDonaldTrump killed NAFTA. But don't worry, job creation and placements are going up @DenaliSun. So is the S&P 500
@BarackObama was a terrible President but I think #JohnMcCain would have been worse. We probably avoided at least one War by not electing him.
Add @ChelseaClinton , a GWB daughters and a @BarackObama daughter in there and you would have a completely worthless panel. Good luck & good ridience.
Interesting so how do you feel about @POTUS now In Contrast to those remarks with @BarackObama ?
1/2 Wow. Thanks to @NMAAHC insta, I learned that on this day, slavery was abolished in the UK, Emmett Till was brutally murdered & @BarackObama accepted the Dem nomination for POTUS.
The #Iran revolutionary regime is counting on change in #USA that will bring them someone like @BarackObama who illegally financed their terrorist revolution with 100s of millions in cash Meanwhile #Europe will help them survive the @realDonaldTrump time
Also #OTD in 2008, @BarackObama became the first African-American presidential nominee from a major political party.

you have confirmed numerous unqualified ultra conservative judges after sitting on @BarackObama 's qualified pick. if #jfk had to write profiles in courage today he couldn't find anyone to write about (including you).
@BarackObama thank you for all the inspiration you have given me throughout your years in office. You gave me the courage to stand up to those in charge over my city and run for mayor. I have faith in myself and I am the underdog but I will always look to you for guidance.

@BarackObama How do you think the Federal governments role in pursuing equality is working? Talk about Civil Rights, Students with exceptionalities, Title IX, and education for minorities,
So even in terms of access to black people @realDonaldTrump beats @BarackObama Who was the Palestinian/Iranian/ISIS rep, flag burning, race baiting, anti-Semite, from the US. that attempted to turn us into a Chicom/Russia quasi-socialist police state by undermining doj integrity
Also guess @espn forgot that @BarackObama is half white and and his white establishment half shown thoroughly during the entirety of his time in office, aside from when he was campaigning.. only time any black people that weren't establishment had access to him

@BarackObama litteraly set back race relations by decades. Racial tensions in this country went back to what they were in the late 70's under Obama, and they are only now begining to get better. Therefore, you must be thanking Obama for giving Trump such a low bar to surpass.

I remember when loser @BarackObama tried to secure the Olympics...
@realDonaldTrump inherited his wealth from Daddy Fred, went bankrupt & got #Putin & #TrumpRussia to bail him out. @realDonaldTrump inherited his economy from Daddy @BarackObama , is working on bankrupting it & will go to #Putin & #TrumpRussia for a bailout. #ObamaIsTrumpsDaddy
Don't forget @BarackObama follows your other account too. Its been a fun day for you Johnna superstar
Did you ask him for @BarackObama birth certificate? (sarcasm)
Thanks @BarackObama
I didn't see @BarackObama do anything to try and censor the movement determined to prove he was born in Kenya; the movement that you proudly supported. You have to accept both good and speech thrown your way. If it's all bad, maybe you're the problem. #History #FreePress #freeUSA
I never put anything past @BarackObama .....he is never to be trusted! I hope this isn't true, but would not be surprised if it was..

I have had a few @SolorioHS alums contact me today to ask about our visit from @BarackObama . They were so hyped & even more proud to have attended Solorio. Of course the $2 mil donation was huge, but so are the ripples from taking the effort to visit & validate the community.
This is the issue @Schwarzenegger and @BarackObama are lending their considerable experience and visibility to. #Gerrymandering is unfair, and every state needs to address it. Fix this, and more balanced election results will be the result.
Thank you @BarackObama
So, I came home from work put on #Netflix and seen #Barry 'great,' I thought, a Barry White biopic. (I failed to read/watch the synopsis/trailer and just pressed play.) I can honestly say this was so inspiring @BarackObama you are an amazing person and have come so far.

Right? Imagration, homelessness and gun control have been haunting us for decades, when if ever will @TheDemocrats @BarackObama have an actual plan that both sides can agree on to fix it? #demexitnow voting in a two party system is the definition of mental retardation.
Happy 4th anniversary to my favorite tan suit of all time worn by @BarackObama ! pic.twitter.com/kNlApWDZaT
@BarackObama oh boy. @realDonaldTrump just took his suite jacket off in your home. He is staying. Worried? Of course you are. There is NO ESCAPE for you. No easy way out for you, will not be allowed.
Thanks @BarackObama ! Long before @POTUS came in.
Exactly bro, it was obj, Gej and @atiku that welcomed @BarackObama to the villa.....but the people visiting Nigeria now are fake because of @MBuhari , even the real @realDonaldTrump that @Mbuhari visited was fake.......
You will be going to prison with your husband @BarackObama . Bitch.

Hey BS Pritzker. Only following till November when you Get an ILLINOIS ATOMIC WEDGIE @HillaryClinton @BarackObama & YOU SUCK
@AbeShinzo @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @JustinTrudeau @theresa_may @EmmanuelMacron @ChinaEmbOttawa Senior U.S. officials expressed irritation that Japan was not forthright about the meeting, despite Washington's near-constant updates to Tokyo on its dealings.
But I will guess @BarackObama will be there.
The people who don't know & understand what went on Against @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton & #cabal #DeepState are willfully ignorant. This non justice must be Rectified & Now. There's more than enough evidence & #Patriots to see through the trials.
@AbeShinzo @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @JustinTrudeau @theresa_may @EmmanuelMacron @ChinaEmbOttawa Japan and North Korea had a "secret" meeting in Vietnam in July without informing the United States, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.
The one that will solidify the wall between law and order that was broken by @BarackObama lawless judges.
Looky Looky When Are The Liberals Gonna Get It? You Have Been Scammed By The Democratic Party.This Ass Is A Fraud. @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/8XTeNDuMU1
Thank you, @BarackObama
@BarackObama @Pontifex Imagine God as Tarzan from Tarzania. Son of Man. The Disney movie. Phil Collins sings it.
#ijs #NAFTA existed before #DonaldTrump just like the rising economy and low unemployment. But way to follow @BarackObama lead @realDonaldTrump I didn't think you had it in you #kudos #MakeTrumpObamaAgain
Tiger Woods was spot on. I didn't agree with @BarackObama on anything but I always respected his position as POTUS
How do I join black twitter? @BarackObama @FloydMayweather
Kolbe Blume is on the @NAFSA staff now?? How cool is that!! We have always had the most awesome staff! And I totally miss @BarackObama as President.

I understand that #RBG used to be @BarackObama 's fitness coach.
@BarackObama built this economy out of the ruble #GDubyaShrub left him in the wake of massive tax cuts for the Rich, 2 wars (1 a war of conquest), & the economic devastation that came from deregulating the financial sector. @realDonaldTrump threatens that stability w/his Tariffs.
Horrific and we sit in silence... @BarackObama is this the progress you referred to while visiting?
