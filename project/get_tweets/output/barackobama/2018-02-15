@JoeBiden please run for president and please bring our world back to sanity and protect us from the harm @realDonaldTrump has brought upon us. We need you. We need @MichelleObama and @BarackObama please.

@BarackObama HE stood up and HES the one that was being a leader at the time when America really needed a leader and when families were crying and wondering what was gonna happen to their children PRESIDENT OBAMA was the one that stood up and all you can do is tweet????-
@BarackObama You must depart or be departed.
You're a complete and total douche bag. Blame students and not your ego of undoing everything @BarackObama did to protect such tragedies. This is what happens when you reverse a bill that banned mentally ill ppl from being able to legally purchase guns. #yousuckballs
2/2 @BarackObama @SenBobCasey @BarbraStreisand @sunny :OUR FUTURE MERCILESSLY LOST TO GREED IGNORANCE&REFUSAL TO PROTECT US RATHER THAN NRA!
@BarackObama said by the gun runner of fast and furious who gave weapons to Mexico drug cartel to kill our DEA agents. Where is does his loyalty point to.

@BarackObama You, Mr. President (and the Mrs.) continue to have a tremendous impact on our youth. For that, I am grateful.
@BarackObama The school was a gun-free zone. What good does it do?..I got an idea, why don't we go back to put the insane in institutions?
How a real president acts in the face or terror and tragedy. Thank you @BarackObama god we miss you. Best president of my lifetime.
when I see news articles that start with "former president @BarackObama " in the title I'm like "NO BRING HIM BACK TO ME"
Okay Obama love the gray @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/E6E86QOa2b

@BarackObama Mr.Obama I have an idea on how to stop the future shootings but I don't know who to talk to about it? Any ideas? Thank You Sir

Well he did beat @HillaryClinton and 16 @GOP establishment candidates in the primary, passed a huge tax bill and has continued to be TeflonDon since his approval rating is higher than @BarackObama at this time in his presidency sooo not quite the waste u say #MAGA
No. Failure was @BarackObama 's DACA executive action in the first place.
@barackobama ....,please go the hell away. You had 8 years to do something, not a damn thing done by you. 14 mass shootings during you 8 yrs and you gave 24 speeches condemning them but did nothing. So go the hell away and stay quite

@BarackObama you have no idea what most Americans want.

Didn't you have eight years to do something? (More if you include your time in the Senate) @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/iPVkt2qlon
S/O to @BarackObama
@davidaxelrod Mr Axelrod, please stop saying how frustrated Obama was about gun control. To be frustrated is to be weak. One admits powerlessness when they say they are frustrated. I don't see @BarackObama as having been weak.
@realDonaldTrump yo dumb ass, have you noticed the amount of individuals that like your tweets. Compare that to the amount of likes @BarackObama gets for his tweets and he's not even POTUS. Any sane individual doesn't give a shit what you have to say
Isn't it time....about time....these troubled individuals can't keep using AR-15's to slaughter fellow classmates. It's ENOUGH! @realDonaldTrump , @BarackObama @Oregonian @CBSThisMorning
People still afraid @BarackObama is coming to take their guns. So they stock up after a shooting.
Why do Democrats block access to mental records? And then complain when the insane get guns. Name a law that would've stopped this. You know that #GunControl is a giant lie! #GunReformNow #NicholasCruz @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/iAtEGbhqYM

@BarackObama , the biggest coward to ever occupy the WH. He couldn't tell the truth if his life depended on it. Pure slime.
Democrats and other mental defectives shouldn't be allowed to own guns @BarackObama , @NancyPelosi , @EricHolder , @HillaryClinton -- not even the mental defectives you provided guns to in Benghazi, Afghanistan or Mexico. #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
You forgot ignorant. Go and hide in your safe space when you encounter facts you don't like. Name a law that would've stopped this. You know that #GunControl is a giant lie!

Assume 120,000 schools $40k salary for military vet to patrol $4.8 billion to cover this. 300million Americans. $16 Can you afford 4 cups of coffee or $16 to help minimize deaths of kids? @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama #Violence
@CNN where was your outrage and blame at @BarackObama when all hose other #MassShootings happened?? How can you blame @realDonaldTrump now that he is president?? Sickening #MediaBias #FloridaSchoolShooting
Obama is just one big pile of manure. @BarackObama
So you would choose to essentially make it tougher for law abiding citizens to protect themselves, because remember, criminals dont follow the law. But of course you would, you're @BarackObama & this is more of the #backwardassery we've come to expect from you. Crawl under a rock pic.twitter.com/XXYlJn73c7

I miss the world we had when my biggest worries where if @MichelleObama would run for office and whether or not the kittens would be happy to see me. I miss @BarackObama please rescue us
Listening to President @BarackObama say he sent a letter to Harold Washington's office asking for a job after he (Washington) was elected Mayor of Chicago.... #MakingObama pic.twitter.com/wNzilnedzw
what #America exactly need about security ? a GREAT WALL or "a common-sense gun safety laws" as former president @BarackObama says ? pic.twitter.com/frRuI1ZlJ7
@BarackObama - if strict gun laws worked you wouldn't have record setting murders in Chicago. Mass shootings are the outcome of liberal policies that have eliminated personal responsibility, justified thug violence calling it "social justice" and made America morally bankrupt.
We miss you so much, @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton
#GunControlNow ! ! take away ALL @BarackObama & @MichelleObama @SecretService AWAY! His WALL too! #IllegalAliens #BuildThatWall #MAGAForAll !

@realDonaldTrump is literally just undoing things because @BarackObama did them.
It's easy, just arrest @BillClinton @BarackObama @johnpodesta @georgesoros Kim Jong-un and all their big time buddies (long list) and wah-lah, 99% of human trafficking would end!!!!! #MAGA #WeThePeople #ObamaGate #GreatAwakening #Treason #FakeNews #WEKNOW
You should have thank the #NRA for giving America so much opportunity to grief @BarackObama @HouseGOP @SarahPalinUSA @washingtonpost
Well I like seeing the Democrats protecting @realDonaldTrump as they did with @BarackObama by not passing anything the President would Veto. However, they are denying Dreamers a pathway to citizenship by voting against a bill Trump would sign. Democrats are no help to Dreamers
Hey @BarackObama Just shut up about Gun control pal You ran guns to Mexican drug cartels Remember Fast and Furious
None of this is OK and is illegal as hell @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @maziehirono @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJoeKennedy @SenSchumer @SenBooker
Trump could win over a lot of people by doing something @BarackObama never did, which is, actually issuing an executive order on gun restrictions; but that's not gonna happen 'cause he values NRA money more than human life.
The FBI (Federal Bureau of Incompetence) knew about this last year, they were warned & did nothing? Why? Bc they were 2 busy doing @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton dirty deeds planting a Russia collusion theory that doesn't exist except from the demoRats
2/2 @BarackObama @SenBobCasey @BarbraStreisand @sunny :when is"he"going to MAN-UP&address the REAL PROBLEM -NEEDLESS ACCESSIBILITY TO GUNS!

@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @SenateDems @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse @the House of Representatives any answers?
And #KaHa @KamalaHarris and #Lying @BarackObama wants to blame guns..
Well unless you are @BarackObama then you get to go what ever you want and sadly everyone agrees.
Enough with blaming teachers, other students, families, #Clinton , and @BarackObama . Make your voice heard through #Votes , #Boycotts , and #Donations for #GunControl . Enough with #EmptyPlatitudes and #FakeCondolences . If you voted for #Trump , U R #Responsible . Period. pic.twitter.com/huRsz7jg1Z
@BarackObama Please focus on your upcoming criminal trial for felony misdeeds as President. Stop lecturing. PS: Your official portrait is a joke.
@BarackObama thanks President Obama for your courage in speaking up about guns, something your successor is unable to do. We miss you more than I can say.
Too bad we don't have a president. On #PresidentsDay we can all fondly think of @BarackObama and wish he were still President
No we don't HAVE TO pass #DACA ! That was a @BarackObama illegal temporary act encouraging illegals to break the law! How about looking out for the LEGAL Americans that put you in office! @chuckschumer @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenWarren @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
.. and @BarackObama and @BillClinton lets keep perspective
