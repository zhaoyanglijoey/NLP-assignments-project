Sounds great. Maybe @BarackObama would like to join us lol
@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama tweeted kind words to the March on Washington today. Yet nothing from you. Waiting for you kind words for this cause
Today was Hope and Change 2.0. Today showed what happens when a generation grows up under a great leader - @BarackObama .
Really what did the @NRA do after #SandyHook to ensure it would never happen again? When did they meet with @BarackObama to move forward after a classroom of 1st graders was slaughtered?
President @BarackObama & VP @JoeBiden will always be my heros, but @repjohnlewis is a tireless rock star for social change. He is our Ghandi, a national treasure showing us how to bend the long arc of the universe toward moral justice! @indivisibleccpa @CCAG_District6 pic.twitter.com/RQrmNuHC7R
Miss them every day! @BarackObama @MichelleObama #NeverAgain #EnoughIsEnough #enough #VoteThemOut
Random observation. Weather you love or hate. @realDonaldTrump he acts like a parent rather than. @BarackObama who treated you like a friend. People need parenting standard. pic.twitter.com/AyRuSkpo3T
Man i miss @BarackObama Thank you sir.
@BarackObama You made them believe w your words of encouragement, faith & hope Mr President & beautiful 1st lady Thank you.
I wonder if @BarackObama loaned his soft shoes to the event. We all know he never used them while I office. #neoliberalismsucks #notademocrat
Well Trump is at a disadvantage because unlike @BarackObama he is not a real or legitimate @POTUS
@BarackObama tweets from the heart and it shows. @realDonaldTrump is trying to compensate as he has no heart.
"Killer Mike" #MarchForOurLives White Democrat massa's attack black rapper!

If @BarackObama were still president, we'd all be speaking Chinese. Just be grateful democracy has been secured. Gun rights are a small price to pay for freedom

This is false. Gun violence is at an all-time low. You lie worse than @BarackObama
What does it feel like being the most loved man in the world @BarackObama ?
Ask republicans. @NPR @nprpolitics @NewsHour @NextGenAmerica @WiseWmnTogether @PodSaveAmerica @ABC @BarackObama @cnnbrk @HillaryClinton @maddow @TomSteyer @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
I would like to point out that @BarackObama signed two gun laws. Both EXPANDED the rights of gun owners. Because #Theyareallthesame . #DemExit #GreenEnter @GreenPartyUS #singlepayer #FucktheNRA #BlueLivesMurder
@BarackObama - this Loyola story is amazing, you feeling it?
@BarackObama try prison reform
Thank-you @BarackObama . With this Administration and this Congress, it's waffling and Brinks Trucks. @NRA is working overtime. Insulting they would make claim that if shooter stopped nobody would know these kids. No way to stop shooters with HC weapons. That is the point.
@BarackObama Bro stay strong and connected. You owe Lincoln University a visit.
I miss having a president who makes me proud and a First Lady who cares about education! @MichelleObama @BarackObama #teachersandgunsdontmix pic.twitter.com/dUniCZcvNm
A nation that can elect @BarackObama at the 44th President of the United States, a nation that can elect @realDonaldTrump as the 45th President, is a nation where anything can happen. #MarchForOurLives #Enough
@BarackObama
@BarackObama These young folks are moving forward wit h change. As Dr Kings grand child says, enough is enough.
No, this looks more like @BarackObama inauguration,
We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity - @BarackObama
@BarackObama Hi Mr president. Nothing but scandal since you left the white House. Gets worse every day. Trump is not a good role model for kids or husbands. What next?
@BarackObama
Attention @JodyWilliams97 @BarackObama @NobelWomen @NobelPeaceOslo @NobelPrize @HHDalaiLama Please consider nominating @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 and #March4OurLives for The Nobel Peace Prize
Thank you @BarackObama
OMFG stop @BarackObama
One of these accounts is not like the other. Hmm, I wonder what it could be. @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump https://twitter.com/barrieblonde/status/977691733252190208/photo/1 pic.twitter.com/qcZmmb8JcW pic.twitter.com/DJR1laTGAu
Jesus Christ... look who's talking about obsession ... who in their right mind says Michelle booty is gorgeous ...Attention @BarackObama this woman is in love with your husband.. and so obsessed with him that she commented a tweet i posted 6 months ago! pic.twitter.com/f387kg5Tdu
If @BarackObama was in office you better believe @Emma4Change would be sitting in the White House right now. #MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/FSa8LNX3oD
I want to meet @BarackObama so I can blink "Please help us," in Morse Code as I laugh crazily on the verge of tears while aggressively shaking his hand with two hands. That would be neat.

Thanks you for shaking my hand and I got you ...in 2012 I have been blessed to work . @BarackObama
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek. -- @BarackObama , 2008 #MarchForOurLives
Have you been to Monument Valley,Utah? Reminder,Zinke/Trump want to drill & mine it @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @SenFeinstein @SenFranken @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @SenSchumer
Did you notice @BarackObama and @MichelleObama sent a handwritten note to Parkland students and today Barack made a statement. Nothing from the imbecile in the Oval hiding in Florida.
I see you on TV shows too. @BarackObama
@BarackObama can you follow me ?
We know this @RamblersMBB team is making the best President ever @BarackObama very proud right now. #Marchmadness #LOYCHIvsKSU

Do you have a fan in Brazil? Why do you see Brazil around the world on newsreels too? @BarackObama #news
Blah, blah, blah....... @BarackObama
@BarackObama come through lord America needs you pic.twitter.com/rznc83BmHM

@BarackObama
@BarackObama @JoeBiden and @JohnKerry trued to destroy our country. Now it's our turn to take our country back!!! #corruptadministration
You want to keep talking shit but what did you do about the mass shooting is Mr @BarackObama ? You either need to shut the hell up and quit degrading our President or hope best for our Country. I'm done with your my shit don't stink attitude
You made a great story. @BarackObama
@BarackObama We support you barack obama, are you a great president, can you follow me? I'm from Brazil, I love you
@BarackObama or @Beyonce
They should have done this alone time ago after Trump became the President. They are loser just like @BarackObama
Geez, you'd think they could have found a picture of Franklin wearing that hat from the @BarackObama 's inauguration, so John wouldn't get all the attention.
@NRA @SpeakerRyan @BarackObama This is insane!! We have 340 million people in the USA and we have 350 million guns in the streets. HOW WHY?
Why just the @GOP ? @TheDemocrats had the WH and Congress. The only gun laws @BarackObama signed EXPANDED the rights of gun owners. Because #Theyareallthesame . #DemExit #GreenEnter @GreenPartyUS #singlepayer #FucktheNRA #BlueLivesMurder
You can't just change the names - it doesn't make any sense - unless of course English is not your native language. I've never heard @BarackObama or HRC say "low functioning" about anyone. #MAGAT #BoughtBot #PutinsParrot #PutinsPuppet #REPTARD
I can be the @BarackObama trade statements to important off for the golf of a sphere to the truth is on the last comments.
@BarackObama I though you did a good job as President. Maybe you didn't accomplish all the change we wanted, but you respected rule of law. Idiot Trump is out of control and the GOP has abandoned their posts. Do I wish Obama was back in the WH! You can say "I told you so!"
Man, you have some serious delusions. Seek help. Medication & therapy. BTW ya'll claimed @BarackObama was coming for your guns starting 10 years ago--if he is, he's working mighty damn slowly. Hang in, he'll get to you one day.
@BarackObama #HOPE #YesWeCan pic.twitter.com/6hYVcsSVzK
But, in all fairness, @BarackObama inherited an economic disaster and @realDonaldTrump only had to ride 44's coattails and not f@#k it up.
This is the support current Pesident should be showing. Thanks @BarackObama for doing the job he's not capable of
@VanJones68 these kids brought me to tears. They recognize that race is a factor and they are willing to stick up for each other. @BarackObama you gave us hope. You set this in motion. Thank u, thank u, thank u
@BarackObama good day
I hope people in your district get involved with @BarackObama and @EricHolder and the @DemRedistrict effort! https:// democraticredistricting.com /
Just like @BarackObama you too were President and did nothing...now you say things that feel good but mean nothing. You too need to just go away!
Can you imagine these marches happening today occurring under @BarackObama and the previous Whitehouse? He'd be saying "HOW CAN WE HELP?" While I'm sure @realDonaldTrump and the current administration is screaming, "How can we stop this?" #ImpeachTrump
