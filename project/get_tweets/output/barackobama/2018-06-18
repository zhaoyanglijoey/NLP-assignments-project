@GeorgeWBush__ @BillClinton @BarackObama Dear Mr. Presidents If they were ever a time in our nation's history now is the time, band together help your country to apply the 25th amendment. Trump needs to be removed from office to save the democracy. Please we are begging you?
But it was okay when it was going on under @BarackObama

Unfortunately @realDonaldTrump is the POTUS yet #Badgrandpa continues to reference @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton . It sure seems as if senility is close to totally setting in.
@BarackObama Obama lied on Iran and attempted to undermine United States policy by funneling billions through the Euro. Now, Congress may be coming after him. You were the worst POS for this country. Traitor! @MichelleObama
To be fair, during Obama's second term it became one of the highlighted topics of Obama's presidency. I believe Vice News did a segment on the increased deportation trend that was developing around the States. The difference is that generally people LIKE @BarackObama personally.
@BarackObama did this during his administration and actually put the children in cages. Where was @NancyPelosi outrage then?
@BarackObama @MichelleObama
@BarackObama Mr President, allow me to shamessly suggest my book, Dangling Propositions, as summer reading for you. This is my shot in the dark attempt to spur sales of my rather uncoventional, slender book, a challenge to perception as your presidency was.
You sure sound like a young @BarackObama HOPE
@BarackObama
I have been there as a US citizen and my son was sent home to Africa to get a visa. Victims of slave masters. When will you be standing up 4 blacks kids currently separated from their parents by CPS? @DNC @GOP @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @Variety @foxandfriends @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/ntmOaQH2G4
Thanks @BarackObama
The Dems are trying to use the children as a reason not to pass any immigration reform then trying to say @potus is using them as leverage. This only became an issue when an @BarackObama era photo surfaced. @RepCuellar admitted that the obama admin kept it quiet #BuildThatWall
Oh and you to @BarackObama
Where was this truth for the 8 years of your husband @BarackObama 's presidency... He certainly over-promised & under-performed! I hope with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump at the helm, #Congress will finally address this mess decades in the making! #IllegalAliens r not #USCitizens #MAGA
Really?? Why were the Dems quiet when @barackObama and @GeorgeBush committed human rights abuses?? Forget about that you hypocrite?

@BarackObama 1/3 Sir, I have a request. I come to you because you made me believe in hope. You made me learn what America really can be. I am trying to start a protest against this maltreatment of children at the border. May I ask you to help me spread the word? As a ministress
If you understand anything about economics, you would know that @BarackObama made it worse. Yes, Bush started it, but BARRY messed it up.
RETWEET @Obama @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @MichelleObama @BarackObama @Laurawbush @GeorgeWBush_43 ALL FORMER PRESIDENTS NEED 2 FIRMLY CONDEMN TRUMP POLICY OF SEPARATION. Give a press briefing about their own policies when they were president. All 1st Ladies condemned this

@BarackObama Thank you for having moral values. You created peace and would have never allowed this child abuse on your watch. #heartbrokenforthesefamilies
Now it's time for @BillClinton @BarackObama @CarterLibrary @TheBushCenter and @GeorgeHWBush to issue joint statement #WhereAreTheChildren
Recently, of course, things are worsened by Trump's rhetoric& #tariffs , but it pains me greatly that just generally since JAN 2017 I've seen fewer Canadian bands in NYC, like maybe the touring incentives&motivators have changed. Definitely more #CANRock here during @BarackObama !
Good question. Why not ask @BarackObama he could tell you.
For every child we release from the "detention center," we should put one @BarackObama administration official there. You can volunteer. We can have @ChelseaClinton join you so you're not separated from your child.

Today I watched an old @BarackObama interview where he said he had hope for the future. I wanted to cry.

Then yell at @BarackObama it was his policy
@BarackObama Americans really need to hear from you. We need your wisdom & voice of hope. We need you 2 set the record straight on fake policy separating kids & parents. Please inspire us with your unwavering faith in humanity to keep fighting this evil. #WhereAreTheChildren
This policy was in place during the @BarackObama admin, the Bush admin. @POTUS wants to deal with this but the Democrats only want to obstruct.
@BarackObama @marthamaccallum @seanhannity @GohenM . Now Obama is weighing in on the children at the boarder where he and his buddy Bush caused this issue. How about the kids in Appalachia with no dental care, no health care, no food?? Oh I see, the migrants are first. Hypocrites
Your husband, @BarackObama , did the same thing in 2014 with the influx of migrants from Central America seeking asylum. Ask him.
Enforcing U.S. law is a choice? What is this @BarackObama "s administration?
The former presidents really need to address this in a joint statement. @realDonaldTrump & @GOP are tearing down the basic foundations of decency of this country. These are not normal times & cant be treated as such. @BillClinton @TheBushCenter @BarackObama
3 guesses @DineshDSouza The first 2 don't count and it rhymes with @BarackObama ! @realDonaldTrump

Totally @realDonaldTrump fault by following a law that George W. Bush signed and @BarackObama continued. The @DNC conspicuously didn't care about separating immigrant families when Obama did it. Political expediency is a hell of a drug. Don't worry, we'll fix it Dems.

Hey @aliasvaughn , There hasn't been a law that @BarackObama or @TheDemocrats have passed that Trump won't overturn or just simply not enforce (Obamacare). Why is this one the exception to the rule?
Why is your news broadcast lying? There has been no new legislation regarding immigration since Trump took office. Democrats, particularly @SenSchumer @SenSchumer2 has OBSTRUCTED every attempt at change. The current laws were signed under @BarackObama . LIARS!

@BarackObama I have a question for you. I recently got recorded sealed and for the past 10 years I have been in any trouble, also I have earn BA and going for my Master, so you think I can get a FOID CARD?
Its weird that i didnt see any pictures from The @nytimes of the immigrant children @BarackObama held in cages back in 2014. Actually i did see them, but not until 2018, and they were blamed on trump. I think thats weird. Dont u think thats weird?
Unsurprisingly Kasie is engaged in pure PARTISAN PROPAGANDA HERE! You know how I can tell? ZERO OUTRAGE when @BarackObama implemented this EXACT SAME POLICY from 2009 until 2014. FRAUD! It's what Kasie does. You are FAKE NEWS.
I really wish it did. The truth is that your party needs these million illegals to come back to power. The truth is that not once have the words "merit" and "immigration" been used in the same sentence during 8 @BarackObama years. The truth is that these kids are props for you.
@KamalaHarris Funny you didn't feel this when @BarackObama did the same thing.
This is 2018, not 2016. @realDonaldTrump is the presidnet not @BarackObama . Time to focus on the present and not the past.
If you do only one thing today, think about the policies of @BillClinton and @BarackOBama and wonder why you didn't care then.

the Obamas went radio silent since leaving stage right @BarackObama if u want to make a good Legacy for urself then protect those kids, toddlers ... oh u can't can u sugar daddy says no doesn't he #tytlive
@BarackObama showed strength & resolve against brutal dictator who starved, tortured, murdered family & own people to keep his grip on power. We don't negotiate with tyrants. We also don't thank cowards trying 2 ingratiate themselves for them for hotel deals & want 'gratitude".
Wrong! It is everything about immigration! Slick Willy @BillClinton started this policy when he was president. Obummer @BarackObama exacerbated it. The dems which is under your control refused then and now to fix it. No more illegals. They all should be sent back. Kids and adults
@davidaxelrod suddenly has grown a heart, after he and @BarackObama are out of Whitehouse. They had nothing to say about #OttoWarmbier or murder of Benghazi patriots...wait they did...lies. David you are such a hypocrite. Please go away. Please take your family on vacation
REMOVE TRUMP--Charge him w/ crimes against humanity @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG @UNHumanRights @SenJeffMerkley @Plaid_Bezos @JohnBrennan @Evan_McMullin @EricHolder @MalcolmNance @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @algore @laurawbush @madeleine @JustinTrudeau
Where was your outrage when @BarackObama was putting immigrant children in cages? Answer? Or are you going to continue to be a hypocrite?
@BarackObama America is in dire need of Direction and is falling apart. What are you prepared to do other than have a TV show in show us pics of your vacations?
What was your response when the kids were in cages under @BarackObama Hussein in 2014? These photos were passed off and blamed on @POTUS which was not accurate.
via @slpng_giants MT @SusannaWhitman BECAUSE there are #humanrights guaranteed world over, thankfully. So these people do have rights. You don't have to be a citizen to have human rights thats global. YES and USA EVEN Used to Honor Them. @maddow @RVAwonk @SenWarren @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/ODGCdYlrsC
Oddly this didn't bother you or @BarackObama doing it for 8 years. pic.twitter.com/IiknEATEXL
Who created the law and the cages was @BarackObama MANY YEARS ago! Who deported 2.800.000 people and separated children from their families in 8 years of government? why you and the media never said anything about it? Why you blame on Trump? #Hypocritals pic.twitter.com/JFBfBctRmf
Ms. Obama, with great respect, we need you and @BarackObama to help organize a way to stop this horror.
@BarackObama sir why can't we charge @realDonaldTrump with world Human rights violations and local child abuse at the state level...along with everyone willing to do the work These are concentration camps...there is no war with these people...Where's the UN?? can they charge him
@politico trying to make like its not a Democratic policy that was meant to keep children safe... @realDonaldTrump just trying to enforce laws unlike his predecessor @BarackObama who selectively enforced whatever he wanted pic.twitter.com/0DrtbXUZlU

FFS! This is truly sad - she's obviously suffering from dementia. Facts show that #Trump has golfed more in his first 2 yrs, than @BarackObama did during his 1st term!
You are just envious of @BarackObama . Get over the fact his inauguration party was bigger than yours. pic.twitter.com/kMTf08T0Em
@BarackObama missing you...
All five living First Ladies have spoken out against the forces separation of children from their parents at border crossings. Pretty sure that means Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and @BarackObama are against it as well.
Trump-like actions @realDonaldTrump could take for #ImmigrantChildren 1. Refuse to sign any legislation until the House and Senate bring comprehensive immigration reform to his desk. 2. Blame @BarackObama for not fixing this problem, and then stop separating children from parents
REMOVE TRUMP @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJoeKennedy @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG @UN @SenJeffMerkley @UNHumanRights
@MSNBC @maddow @Lawrence @TheRevAl @BarackObama @davidhogg111 @SecTomPerez @keithellison @SenSanders @CoryBooker @chuckschumer @SenKamalaHarris @AriMelber We must have ONE strong Dem to beat Trump & the cowardly Repubs to restore our USA to power & pride!
@BarackObama where is The Man Behind Jeff sessions and Donald Trump's and secretary Nielsen's internment camps America is waiting to hear from you pic.twitter.com/879fTY5Csb
We must surrender Our rights to an all powerful sovereign. @BarackObama said so. @realDonaldTrump @foxnews @SenateMajLdr @TGowdySC @tweetcongress now bow down to the #builderburg group. https:// youtu.be/44kW03sfKrI
Not only that: this policy originated with @BillClinton and @BarackObama . If one didn't care then, they can't be indignant now.
Stop telling me to " #TrustSessions " whose going after cannabis,bitcoin prices& tuna manufacturers while treasonist pedophile sickos like @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @johnpodesta @BarackObama gallavant around the globe 4 TWO yrs! @POTUS @CraigRSawyer @Fulcrum__News @PrisonPlanet
@BarackObama please Mr. President speak out on the horrific and inhumane actions being visited upon these poor children and their parents. I feel like your words would go along way to helping us mobilize and embolden our efforts to help change what is happening
@BarackObama would be nice to see you give an interview or press conference about the child abuse being commited by the US government.
Didn't seem to bother you when @BarackObama did it. #Hypocrisy #Hypocrites
As a senator, your husband @BarackObama blocked bipartisan legislation that would have changed immigration policy because he wanted the issue for his presidential run. Go away.
Instead of rhetoric, former First Ladies & former Presidents, need to walk into these detention centers, walk the children out and reunite them with their parents. Let @DHSgov and @ICEgov try to stop them. @MichelleObama @laurawbush @BarackObama @GeorgeHWBush
But alas, @BarackObama was nothing but the worst president in American history if not a downright traitor due to his dealings w/ #Iran .
@GeorgeHWBush @BarackObama @BillClinton @jimmycarter2017 @laurawbush @HillaryClinton @MichelleObama the First Ladies are more presidential than all the presidents combined...wake up! Say something...ANYTHING. This is not the America you have led... Stop trump
You seem to forget @BarackObama was doing the SAME thing to the poor children. Blame the parents for forcing their children thru that just to get welfare! BTW why are you here talking politics this is a SPACE FORCE topic!
If u was gonna break the laws in a foreign country/land whould u bring ur children- @realDonaldTrump ? Ask yourself what would @BarackObama Do?
I am not sure @BarackObama knows who he is obviously he thinks that he is the Baphomet pic.twitter.com/VH5XSexMIk

. @BarackObama Please comment on how you feel about your words and image appearing on the wall of a detention center, used to endorse imprisonment of children.
Not only that: this originated with @BillClinton and @BarackObama . If one wasn't care then, one can't be indignant now.

Hey evangelicals. His words not mine. Leviticus 19:34 The Foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt I am the Lord your God @JoelOsteen @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @MSNBC N E one?
Was it OK when @BillClinton and @BarackObama were OK with it? Or is it just not OK now, because @realDonaldTrump is President? I checked out @YouTube and couldn't find any old videos of you not being OK with those two former Presidents. Hmmmmmm... curious
That's exactly what trump and his deplorables have been hoping for especially @BarackObama . With him being black he will be the only one that trump would comment about and President Obama knows this
Time for Trump to be removed @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJoeKennedy @BarackObama @SenJeffMerkley @UNHumanRights

@BarackObama Did when he was running. Sounds familiar. https:// youtu.be/12e6uKM8iZQ
This is child abuse and kidnapping. I am calling on all living former presidents to use their influence on both sides of the aisle to stop this abomination. We are no better than Nazi Germany. @BarackObama @GeorgeHWBush @georgewalkerbush @BillClinton @realDonaldTrump
