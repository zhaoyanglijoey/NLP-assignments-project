The Republicans and their supporters are okay with criminal behaviour as long as they can get their policies implemented. In other words, rolling back anything @BarackObama did. No need to ponder why none are doing due diligence, vetting, or oversight. @crookedmedia
@BarackObama #clapbackking
LMAO you maga's only response is to go after @BarackObama You can do better then that Must ask Did you ever serve? Ever been in a VAMC? Ever had their services? I am 80% disabled and I know what's best for me and hopefully those who served And I don't support a 4X draft dodger
@BarackObama No Scandals Huh? Creating ISIS Illegal DACA Illegal Wiretapping Illegally spied on Americans Gave $1.5 billion to enemies Weaponized FBI, CIA, IRS Lied about Obamacare Lied about the Benghazi attack Lied about Fast and Furious
Yes! @BarackObama was a complete Disaster as President and history will prove be had nobody to blame it on.
Yeah, I remember when @BarackObama went around apologizing and bowing to everyone, telling them what a horrible country we were. Now we have a REAL President!!

THIS is what a REAL president looks like. Empathetic intelligent Funny Compassionate Inspiring Empathetic Honest You WILL NEVER be my PRESIDENT. Ever. I hate what you done to this country and everything America is about. @BarackObama I miss you. pic.twitter.com/ZvB5Qkm9w1
@BarackObama Hey Pres. Obama! I believe the tribal Us vs. Them rhetoric is the primary reason for societal dysfunction, so am doing a podcast to view life from someone else's perspective (engender empathy). I'm in DC May 1-10; have time for an interview?
I am sure @BarackObama thinks it is okay. He would send them millions of dollars and ask nothing in return. It is difficult for some people(mostly dems) to wrap their heads around the right way of doing things after enduring 8 years of Obama admin.
@lala @chrissylampkin @TheEllenShow @TheTalkCBS @MichelleObama @BarackObama please share this video. This cruelty has to stop! https:// instagram.com/p/BiCtUvDhB5M/

Did you stand up to @BarackObama when he was trying to push his socialism agenda?
@BarackObama . Whats going on with this President you have go back to the office for a minute until we can find a suitable candidate its a must
So, what about when #LoisLerner took the 5th? Does that mean she's guilty? If so, that means your #Messiah , . @BarackObama DID turn the . @IRSnews into a weapon against #Conservative oraganizations. Thanks for once again proveing youre a #Lieuser @tedlieu

OK, @PeteSouza , you know what to do. We need photos of @BarackObama playing with kids in the Oval Office. Let the trolling begin...
yo im tired of the @BarackObama hate because he didn't do for the black community he was the PRESIDENT not the president of the black community he did a good job as the first black president so we can have another one who might choose to focus on black issues.
Like I said, in seven years from now when @realDonaldTrump has had the same amount of time to correct things @BarackObama destroyed, we will talk.
Nowadays, it's the idea that only their idea matters and anything else is wrong. Not even any idea, really. Take "Obamacare", an idea @BarackObama appropriated from Mitt Romney and improved upon. This was not an original liberal idea, it was a good idea improved upon.
And I bet @BarackObama sent her a nice birthday present, picked together with @MichelleObama , sorry nothing creepy, not everyone is like you.
https:// youtu.be/MJ6rFVhiMX8 WOW! This just plain blows the lid off of the deep state! @realDonaldTrump is aware of this momo! I advise everyone to watch this video! @HillaryClinton @BarackObama should be and will be brought up on high treason! This is #ObamaGate !
Wait until the DOJ gets through with @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton , then tell me that again. It's coming like a big red wave! It's gonna wash all the crap out of DC and there is plenty of it! They will be indicted! #DrainTheSwamp
I miss you @BarackObama

Really appreciate the necessary conversation happening at #2018CCER @metronyu thanks to @ESINYC for giving @NYCSchools teachers a place to communicate about race, language, culture. Tonight, we are discussing code-switching. Thinking of people like #jayz and @BarackObama
@BarackObama I am so excited that you're coming to Porto! Any chance you'll be meeting up with local Americans? ;) If you need a tour guide, let me know!
Hell no @BarackObama has already done enough damage to this country.
it was very convenient that James Comey employed the "not to my recollection" multiple times, funny how he can specifically remember certain conversations but then can't remember such important details. wonder is he, @HillaryClinton @BarackObama appearing b4 Mueller

It's very complicated depending on what country you're talking about, they're all similar but NOT the same. You can't use a cookie-cutter strategy. @POTUS knows this. @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama were the #AmateurHour shit-show. The real adults are in control now. Worry not!
You really should find better sources to cite. You progressives would rather see this country fail than see Trump succeed. That is sad. As horrible and ratchet @BarackObama was, never did I want him to not succeed. #theconservativerevolution #truthhurts #trump2020

Where was all this political awareness of corruption when @BarackObama bara was in office?
Well, that's a first. Interesting, my white friends don't think that's the case at all. They think I'm daft for caring about stupid stuff like injustice, #BLM , #TakeaKnee , believing @BarackObama was the greatest president ever. Who knew suggesting punctuation was offensive?

@BarackObama pic.twitter.com/f4S3dLFjAW
I'm sure Merrick Garland and @BarackObama would agree with stupid ass statement. Maybe if @realDonaldTrump and team would vet properly, or submit qualified candidates things would go quicker. For example...Dr. #Jackson ...lol
@BarackObama as a dedicated public servant, please apologize to @kanyewest for calling him a "jackass" so he can stop this nonsense.

Fact of the matter is @realDonaldTrump has a 4.1%, the unemployment rate is at a 16-plus-year low, which continues an 8-year trend from 10.0% at the worst point of the Great Recession during the @BarackObama administration.

Just watched David Letterman interview @BarackObama on @NetflixUK , and I can honestly say I can't think of another president or world-leader who consistently says so very many things that I agree with. What a sensible, thoughtful person.
Unfollowing @KAYNEIWEST cuz like I don't need advice from a trump "supporter". Just to make it clear...I HATE DONALD TRUMP.WANNA KNOW WHY? 1)HE'S DUMB 2) HE'S RACIST 3) I WISH @BarackObama WAS STILL PRESIDENT 4) I SUPPORT @HillaryClinton 5) I HATE HIM
@SenWarren appears confused. The 'most corrupt administration' so far is the @BarackObama administration. #Trump has a long way to go just to get to 1/8th of the past 8 years. She simply throws stuff out without facts.
Two peas in a pod #CorruptCopComey @Comey @BarackObama
All this bullshit that we're going through right now is to protect @BarackObama Obama.
Look at that @BarackObama ! This image alone highlights how inept you were as a president. Around this same point of your presidency, you were supplying/arming/training ISIS mercanries.
Remember the "There's my African-American over there!" Let's not forget his racist speech at rallies since 2015. Let's not forget the racist birther movement to undermine our outstanding first Black President @BarackObama

@BarackObama stupid you not potus any more be gone
OMG. Even @realDonaldTrump slipped and admitted the @BarackObama is POTUS #FoxAndFriends #impeach45
.. 'I've only seen that in the media.' Talking points used by @BarackObama as @POTUS when he played dumb about corruption in his Administration that he was well aware of or he was just stupid. @brithume @MZHemingway @stephenfhayes @FoxNews @CNNPolitics
Maybe @BarackObama should have invested his time better, maybe working to improve Chicago instead of waltzing thru concerts while Chicago Rotted away. JS
Because @BarackObama already knew about it?? Sounds about right.

Of course @BarackObama bloody well knew what was going on along with @JoeBiden and his entire team.

In all honesty the best person to ask is @BarackObama , he got to pick and choose which one was more beneficial every step of his life!
I couldn't agree more!! How in the world was @BarackObama able to employ him!?! Didn't @BarackObama vet the doctor before he hired him!?! When will @BarackObama comment on his hiring of the doctor!?!
@BarackObama was a joke: a very bad joke!
After 8 years under @BarackObama , the community organizer was successful at organizing black folks deeper down into the democrat plantation of lies for the continuance of govt reliance and the belief of victimhood. #AwakeningNow
Sorry Sean but the jobs numbers and growth is down to the things @BarackObama did in his term. The stocks are now starting to slide down.. thanks to @realDonaldTrump #bbcqt

At 4:35 pm today on the @RodArquette Show: @jimantle of the @dcexaminer on his piece asking why @POTUS can't simply end DACA they way @BarackObama began it, without congressional approval
Legislative body creates and makes changes to the law not the president. @realDonaldTrump does not over reach like @BarackObama did on DACA
I agree @BarackObama was all those
@johnlegend can you specify one policy @realDonaldTrump has implemented that is against people of color? Furthermore, would you say people of color are better of now then they were 8 yrs ago due to @BarackObama policy? The race baiting from your party has been exposed #maga
How so? I "asked" to list the lies. You came up with ZERO of any consequence. I listed THREE WHOPPERS from The Left's HERO @BarackObama . You do the same for Trump. THREE BIG LIES, PROVEN ONES. Go on.
For me its Joe. Used to watch regularly. No more. Joe renounced the Republican party but old allegiances die hard Listen to the disdain in his voice when discussing "the Democrats" or @BarackObama Still repeating the same ole, "Democrats have no message" What's @GOP 's message?
You all should go grab a drink with @BarackObama & @MichelleObama instead
How about you name one GOOD thing...& do not try to steal @BarackObama 's credit. We won't let you!
White People died under @BarackObama Remember he went golfing. #Benghazi
America loves @BarackObama
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump is just getting bit cranky and tired so maybe its time for grandpa to move. I think senate should try to negotiate on a deal where oldman gets State of Hawaii and @BarackObama would be abolished to Kenya. That would be fair price for USA! #nurses
