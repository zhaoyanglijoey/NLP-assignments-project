. @BarackObama and @joebiden made a surprise visit to @dogtagbakery in Georgetown on Monday. The latest story in our What Works Next series features millennial-run programs like Dog Tag Bakery that are serving veterans across the country. @Dogtagbakery https:// politi.co/2LMV81a pic.twitter.com/UN32dcai28
@BarackObama was never a friend of the military. I am blessed to have not had to serve under his regime.
Please come back!!!!! Please!!!! @BarackObama
Many people believe it's a cover up, because it's nonsense! Meddaling in elections- going on 4eva! Ask @BarackObama what he did to Israeli/Chinese elections? Waste of TAXPAYER'S dollars
Always, always... @BarackObama and @JoeBiden ALWAYS!!!
I literally thought, "Wow. She is beautiful." That's an amazing color on her. @MichelleObama @BarackObama
I miss you, @BarackObama !
I love how folks @jaketapper didn't want @BarackObama @JoeBiden when they had him and now want him to come to the rescue. Go troll that *%!$%* at Fox News. Life of a black man, Jake. Life of a black man.
I have a dream! Please look at the attached pic. Joining the party and promoting progressives #FBRparty . Please: 1 Like 2 Retweet or Reply 3 Follow I follow you back. @krassenstein @TalbertSwan @TheUSASingers @EdKrassen @BarackObama @morningmika @JoeNBC @TalbertSwan pic.twitter.com/ArRmbqDmYz
@BarackObama @JoeBiden we miss you guys!!
#ItsNotMagicIts - OK I lied, they are magic and this video of Obama and Biden makes me really happy!! @BarackObama and @JoeBiden , we miss you. Thank you for - being good human beings that America can be proud of. pic.twitter.com/pTE9Tc5P75
@BarackObama @JoeBiden oh please let this be the first photo op of the Biden/Obama 2020 campaign!!!!

@BarackObama
Anybody know where @CNN was when @BarackObama said the same thing? #WalkAway
Give the man a break @jaketapper .. Iike the man @BarackObama himself said.. His administration was scandal free ! pic.twitter.com/3g60rP4GEy
@BarackObama was the worst in the history of America. Don't cut him slack with any qualifying language.
@jaketapper Is it okay that @BarackObama and @JoeBiden ate lunch today together, or is that too superficial to report on?
Can @BarackObama run as VP in 2020?
The dons an odd chap but is @BarackObama still working on Guantanamo his 1st thing. It said he was 10 million better off after the game show @realDonaldTrump has his own rules to the game but we may have an end in sight Beam me up WW3 @jeremycorbyn 4UK
@JoeBiden @BarackObama
I really truly miss them, I think the whole world and most of all the country miss them both @JoeBiden @BarackObama
@JoeBiden @BarackObama
@jaketapper needs to pay closer attention to the news. @BarackObama is no longer @potus . If Jake wants to be the work ethic police he might want to have a chat with the guy who spends 5 days a week sending the country to hell and every weekend golfing.
@BarackObama @JoeBiden @nytimes Gentlemen, maybe you can answer this burning question that many have? At what point does a #patriot stand up and say enough of #TrumpTreason grab a fire arm & head down to DC to confront the #TRAITOR in the @WhiteHouse ? As our ancestors did?
InTheLandOfStupid is more like it. Their last day in office is fortunately in rearview mirror. @BarackObama used his @DOJ @FBI to surveil the opposition party using fascist police state tactics and u r either ok w that or dumb as a post. #WalkAway #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Really interesting chat about the @BarackObama Mandala lecture. Obama openly talks about what Chomsky has said for decades. Its pretty incredible. @RonPlacone @jimmy_dore @grahamelwood @miserablelib @HumanistReport @KyleKulinski https:// youtu.be/jH1mOgjUqxk
God I miss them @BarackObama @JoeBiden pleeeeeeeease come back!! pic.twitter.com/b4uK66JFXH

You're right, no one is above the law. Time to arrest #CrookedHillary and @BarackObama for their many crimes. And #FakeNews , you helped Bill Clinton get away with rape. Screw you CNN.
@BarackObama @JoeBiden #MissThem
Please come back!!!! @BarackObama @JoeBiden
Glad @POTUS44 @BarackObama @TheDemocrats n @KamalaHarris put the #bankers n jail!!! Oh @stevenmnuchin1 is still #free #NVM . @cenkuygur @JayarJackson @johniadarola @AnaKasparian @jimmy_dore @miserablelib @RonPlacone @angela_rye @VanJones68 @Ocasio2018 @SenSanders #RegulateTheBanks
I miss President @BarackObama and Vice President @JoeBiden every single moment that trump is in The People's White House. From the best of the best to the absolute worst. Jesus take the wheel and drive us out of the mess we're in.
Great Move O' You Probably Picked Up Quite A Few Votes With That One! Thanks @BarackObama !
HONEST QUESTION: CAN @JoeBiden RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020 AND @BarackObama AS HIS VP??
@BarackObama I don't want my tax dollars supporting killers. Police departments.
We are thankful for our military and those who serve to protect our NATION (bc we have borders). We are thankful to our @POTUS and his administration for all they do to correct the wrongs imposed by @BarackObama 's regime and @HillaryClinton 's evil intent.
If we send "North Korea" 150 billion in unmarked dollars and Euros I'm sure they'll be our friends.. right @BarackObama ?
@BarackObama policemen are nothing but murderers/killers. Shooting their guns with innocent people around & unarmed black men. How do we Defund the POLICE DEPARTMENT?
Move to the US, we have plenty of great jobs. Healthcare is a little pricey since the @BarackObama presidency, but thanks to @realDonaldTrump we are no longer forced to have it. #Winning
Sigh, I miss seeing them everyday. @BarackObama @JoeBiden
The GOP appears to be the party in trouble but sure, lets blame @BarackObama
i have never missed a human being i have known in real life as much as i miss @BarackObama
I had a dream last night that thrilled me 2 my bones. { And it wasn't wet } I dreamed that N the November elections we took the Senate & the House away from the Republicans. And, in 2020 @JoeBiden ran 4 president, & @BarackObama was his vice-president. Trump was in Leavenworth.
This looks like a winning 2020 ticket. That's what I'm thinking, @JoeBiden @BarackObama
Did @BarackObama and @JoeBiden approve it?
@BarackObama YOUR PLAN TO DESTROY TRUMP IS BACK FIRING ON YOU AND YOUR ADMIN. IF ANYTHING, ALL YOU DID WAS GUARANTEE TRUMP ANOTHER 4 YEARS IN THE WH. THANKS FOR ALL YOU DID, AND FOR OPENING OUR EYES TO THE CRIMES OF THE DEM. PARTY. YOU ALL SUCK DICK!! pic.twitter.com/lNKhdus99h
id it, @tammyrosescott ! I miss @BarackObama and @JoeBiden so much!
I miss you @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/MwuKJQDqqL
The epic reunion of @JoeBiden & @BarackObama has inspired to set up an epic reunion of my own! We're going to need all hands on deck to elect @DanK ! That said, see you on the doors @Jonpine24 @loneillNH @natefitzhenry & @YoKinsman ?? #CrushCityReunion #StateStreet #HartThumb
This visit is pandering and sadly disingenuous and a #cheapphotoop probably made @BarackObama ill since he despises our military
You said it, @tammyrosescott ! I miss @BarackObama and @JoeBiden so much!!!
So? @BarackObama still gotta get his party on. Sorry @jaketapper pic.twitter.com/CKJmc0ydPr
Remember how horribly our last legitimate, democratically elected @POTUS44 @BarackObama was treated and criticized, because he was willing to meet with the Iranians without preset conditions? Suddenly, with @realDonaldTrump as our first non- @POTUS it seems ok. #TrumpGOPHypocrisy
TRUMP'S ASKED IF HE HAS A RED LINE ON BORDER FUNDING TAKES A SWIPE AT OB... https:// youtu.be/U4QKLAEKBUw ...... #FailedBarackObama @BarackObama
How about @KamalaHarris for Prez and @BarackObama for VP? Biden for Sect of State.
2012:The difference between @MittRomney and @BarackObama 's campaign promises to @Israel is that Mitt will actually keep all of his.
Two awesome guys. Miss them. @BarackObama @JoeBiden
@BarackObama @JoeBiden I love these men! I wish they would come back! Please for all that remains good in America...Please (I'm on my knees) please come back!
@BarackObama And If Owner Or Responsible Person Die Of That Entity The Enforcement Done By UN Because That Entity Is Passed By UN And Development Also Checked By ICJ Of The Nation....! It's Very Simple To Understand...!
Dear @BarackObama , I miss you! -Democracy
@BarackObama Fennel salad is actually pretty good.
Uncle Joe: The double-undone top buttons have become a post-White House staple for @BarackObama , but why are you wearing a Maga hat? pic.twitter.com/KmNHOsfib3
Thank you @BarackObama
I sure do miss those guys! To deal with the anger, disillusionment, and anguish about the current state of our federal government, I watch videos of @BarackObama . Perhaps this #November2018 American will reclaim some of its government. #VOTE as if our well-being depends on it.
So you people already planning on blaming Trump's crash on @BarackObama ?? Just wow!!
I agree @Trevornoah #AnneLowery the #Government needs to give everyone money for UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME. $500-1000 per yr = 3.9 trillion per GDP. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama just cut a low tax from state tax, carbon tax etc. @FoxNews @CNN @TheView Now that's news
My President and Vice President. We miss our last true leadership @BarackObama @JoeBiden
So, the cutest thing happened. Former dynamic duo @BarackObama and @JoeBiden met for lunch. It was epic. https:// buff.ly/2OtbDhn pic.twitter.com/J1JxmgJRpX

Love. So nice to see sanity, class and intelligence again. @BarackObama @JoeBiden
Such welcome images and news! Thanks @BarackObama and @VP44
The 4.1% is a small bump in what has been a steady linear rise in the GDP since @BarackObama turned the economy around in 2010. If you can hold on to that number for the next 3 quarters then maybe you have done something but I think next quarter is going to be well below 4%
Seeing @BarackObama & @JoeBiden , out together, smiling, relaxed. Made me so happy. Then it was gone, replaced by Trump's latest lie
@JoeBiden @BarackObama , come back! Please save us!

You know not of what you speak....we support @realDonaldTrump because he loves this country and capitalism unlike freeloading parasites like @BarackObama and his minions

Is this true? @BarackObama
Yummy ! Ham and gruyere on shallot-jam ciabatta, a slice of mint-basil blueberry cake, brownies and coffee. How does president @BarackObama stay so thin ? I really adore and miss them both -- @BarackObama @JoeBiden -- so much !!!!!
I want a reality show that has @BarackObama and @JoeBiden just driving around in an RV. If anything, just to drive Der Trumpenfuhrer insane due to their crazy high ratings it would receive. #MakeItHappen

@BarackObama Follow me
I love it @BarackObama @JoeBiden
@BarackObama a true leader of the Free world, get back here please. Hehe enjoy yourself with that beautiful family. @JoeBiden don't you need a vice president???
Jay just happen to be in town the same day Nunes is. I love it! and the Tan Suit, is this a nod to @BarackObama ?
Where's the picture where @BarackObama gives medals to ALL OF HOLLYWEIRD!!! LoL
Also reminds me that for the LIFE of me 14 years after I first heard his name, I couldn't name one "personal lawyer" for @BarackObama . Ty Cobb and John Dowd should be clinking glasses of Macallan at Capital Grille every night and thanking their lucky stars that they're out.
I MISS YOU @BarackObama @JoeBiden !!! pic.twitter.com/OUOFcAu2rJ
These particular homeless fella's were HUNGRY and needed access to food. We need to find ways to feed the homeless... like these two...plus two or three ...or three million others. @JoeBiden @BarackObama
Trying to fit into @BarackObama portrait?
. @BarackObama gave health care to millions of Americans. In return he lost mid election. Now people ask him to save them from @realDonaldTrump ? Sometimes I feel the Americans deserve trump.

.@Jamyawh. Somehow, every day to pose for pictures but the camera down @BarackObama 's $3. AMAZING! @CNN is all negative.
Italy's Prime Minister Conte respects our president, like the rest of the world leaders! That's because they know he is courageous & fearless & everyone respects a leader like that! Finally, we have a president we can be proud of! @GOP @DNC @SenSchumer @BarackObama @NBC @ABC @CBS
@JoeBiden & @BarackObama need their own comedy special. Please #Netflix ... tanks
Usually, this is wat is done right? Both sides coming to the table either for diplomacy, to bring their list of demands, or strategically to size each other up. @BarackObama did it. I guess the real prob is @realDonaldTrump can't b trusted to do any of those correctly
Why Sanctions in the First Place? @UNSC must bring to justice all those who falsely accused, voted & abstained to sanction #Eritrea all must compensate the nation of @BarackObama @AmbassadorRice @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn @CohenOnAfrica @eliasamare pic.twitter.com/ihAE6AlcWc
I love it @BarackObama @JoeBiden
@jaketapper you are wrong as two left shoes. There was no precipitous decline of the @DNC during @BarackObama two terms. But rather the party and the Obama Administration suffered from a continued attack by the #media and the GOP.
@BarackObama we miss you, please come back pic.twitter.com/JEGmYRgCA0

I would love to have these two gentlemen @BarackObama @JoeBiden back in office!
center of my chest just seized. The heartache in just watching these great guys. You know how much we miss you @BarackObama and @JoeBiden , right
Damnit! I literally got teary-eyed watching the vid of @BarackObama and @JoeBiden at @DogTagBakery . I miss the dynamic duo.
@BarackObama I will completely mathematically prove my 2 universe creations by news at 9 a.m., 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.
Hey @jaketapper , @BarackObama went and got some cake and brownies today. You gonna be pissy with him over eating dessert too?

@BarackObama & @JoeBiden of course!
Shout out to @BarackObama on National Whistlebower Day. You and your administration undermining the freedom of the press by applying the Espionage Act on whistleblowers more than every other presidency combined should get the shameful acknowledgement that is deserved

Hypothetically, if @JoeBiden runs and wins the @TheDemocrats nomination in 2020, can he select @BarackObama as his runnning mate?

I would love to vote @JoeBiden for president, with @BarackObama as VP! In a HOT minute. Pretty sure I'm not alone!
Well thank goodness @BarackObama had the vision to start inspiring and teach young people, to embrace politics and develop their skills.
I miss them!!! @BarackObama @JoeBiden
@BarackObama didn't do that.
@cvpayne just curious @BarackObama @ValerieJarrett @HillaryClinton @DNC @TheDemocrats label 2008 the GREAT RECESSION was it really a Great Recession?? Interesting no one mentions @SenSchumer role in CA INDY MAC LIE ??
Damn I miss those two! @BarackObama @JoeBiden
@SpecialReport Didn't catch the chuckle head that said DJT would legitimize Iran like w/NoKo if he met with them. Didn't @BarackObama do that by signing the terrible Iran nuclear deal and topped it off by negotiating w/terrorists a second time by paying billions $ for hostages?
Ban him @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @MichelleObama @MELANIATRUMP
Words cannot describe how much I miss these two. @BarackObama @JoeBiden #TrueLegends #Love #POTUS #VP #America
Even as President @BarackObama could slip out and buy burgers for the gang. @realDonaldTrump can't walk among the public because Americans DO NOT LOVE HIM!
