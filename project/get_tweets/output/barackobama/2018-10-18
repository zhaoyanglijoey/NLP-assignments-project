@BetoORourke reminds me of @BarackObama . Regardless of where you stand, they are both incredible communicators. #TexasTownHall
Thank you @LLSAdvocacy for helping to tell my brave son Lucas's story. @GOPLeader @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @realDonaldTrump we must #DefendPreEx . #PreExistingConditions #cancersurvivor #cancer #Survivor @KGETnews @bakersfieldnow @KHNews @HealthCareGov @BarackObama @JoeBiden
But it was ok when @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton allowed our very own Ambassador to be brutally murdered in Libya. Stand down old man! You have no credibility!
when i listen to #Beto sometimes, i swear he is channeling @BarackObama ! @BetoORourke
@BarackObama how disgusting @SenatorCantwell we need a leader. Turkish officials played Sec. of State Pompeo an alleged audio recording of Khashoggi's murder inside Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Pompeo was also given a transcript the official says. http:// abcn.ws/2yMv11H

@BetoORourke reminds me of @BarackObama when he speaks. I just need to hear everything he has to say. #TexasTownHall
Listening to @BetoORourke who reminds me of @BarackObama - kindness, thoughtfulness, listening, speaking fairly. Truly a welcome change from the fury we hear daily. I think he has a great future helping improve lives of many -
Instead of jailing the Wall St banksters he rewarded them w/ massive bailouts at the taxpayer expense. @BarackObama permanently extended the Bush tax cuts. Now the US is owned by oligarchs + corporations, the middle class is gone+ the wealth inequality is vast. We're screwed.
This guy sounds and reminds me of @BarackObama , I wish he wins in Texas.
@BarackObama is the ultimate #NPC pic.twitter.com/KNtzuBg3JC
@BetoORourke says the booming economy is thanks to @BarackObama .
Amazing. @BarackObama never asked for cooperation from Mexican Govt. Hurray @realDonaldTrump !!!
@BarackObama loved the video on voting excuses, but how do you counter that there will never be a viable third option or that special interests control all policies and fund all candidates?

Are you fucking kidding me? Back in 2010, Senator McConnell famously said they would do anything they could to make @BarackObama a 1-term President. They failed by the way. @GOP are the real obstructionists. Get your head out of Trump's ass, before you suffocate.

Remember when @JoeBiden said some very racial things about @BarackObama , then a democrat called him out? They all think the same. I have no idea why you'd think they are not racist. https:// youtu.be/wIOXfqvBEaE the only reason why they need blacks is for votes.

Sweetheart, did @senatemajldr lift a SINGLE finger to help @BarackObama one time? Or was he quoted as saying he will do all he can to stop everything? Hypocrite.
I think they are confused with @BarackObama rallys
@BetoORourke reminds me of @BarackObama Big future for this man!
he missed his window, he can still be a huge help, but we need younger and with it. We need someone like @BetoORourke He has the same initials, BO, as @BarackObama Can you smell the BO? Beto looks like the guy I want standing on stage debating Trump. LOL
It would be a diplomatic crisis if @POTUS were like @BarackObama swept the issue such as #Benghazi under the rug. But @POTUS @realDonaldTrump being responsible and proper government, allow the evidence to unfold (he has an idea already) before jumping to conclusion. @SecPompeo

Our Leaders are M.I.A @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton Meanwhile Trump is hoping across the nation and attacking. @MSNBC has not called out our top leaders for Hiding. What are they waiting for? Someone told then to hide because the GOP will get fired up! Chicken crap! pic.twitter.com/rlTW0ATTt3
I said something nice about @BarackObama and @MichelleObama from my old Twitter account (est 2013) @cherryisblushin . Twitter suspended me because I believe in God. Twitter misses them. Yeah right! Liars!
@BarackObama If you can not do this for Us Barack our only REAL choice will be what the Second ammendment was created for. We must take up arms against our bad government and those who support this bad government.
#VoteRED !--November 6 2018 #Democrats #WalkAway from #Socialist #Democratic party!Follow advice of @BarackObama 's brother who knows what he is talking about! pic.twitter.com/Ixl1ctCUn9
To be fair the other 29.6% did happened under @DNC @POTUS with only 21% belonging to @BarackObama and the other 8.6% under @BillClinton so the next time @DonaldJTrumpJr or @realDonaldTrump or @EricTrump or @IvankaTrump tout DJIA numbers remember this.
@BarackObama please get celebs to target fans to vote,we have to get the youngsters attention first to get them to vote
@BarackObama We dont need you to do a FEW TV SPOTS. We need you to go from City to City making BIG GATHERING Speaches some thin like TUMPS Ralleys. But We need you to bring US together. NOT Tear us apart like TRUMP is doing. Please help your mine and OUr country
Thanks for the new word #intersectionality had to look it up. I'm not a leftie or a rightie. I'm an American 1st. I called out @BarackObama BS when he was president. I'm certainly not going to stop now that its a different party sitting behind the Resolute Desk.
@BarackObama & @LouisFarrakhan A picture is worth a thousand words pic.twitter.com/NCV3XeuFTY
I have been Tweeting up a storm for M.I.A @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton to visit SAFE states that they can increase turnout. I say go for it. I don't believe that some action fires up a base. People were going to vote anyway. It's better to go down swinging than LOOKING1 pic.twitter.com/PRHVn3pVwf
@SamPatochek Imagine if @BarackObama had said he was too "busy" to visit troops overseas?
@BarackObama This is not something Hillary can do. This is not something Bill Clinton can do. The last time this country was in dire straights we Had 43 G.W Bush destroying all of the currency in this country. It took A BLACK MAN, The first in the history of our country.
@timkaine @BarackObama who cares what he says we're working on dismantling his treason as you speak
@TheFive case says, it's ok to kill a journalist, because @BarackObama and @SenSchumer let SA get away with 911. So it's ok to kill a journalist in broad daylight, on camera, while the whole world watch. It will be more that die. @CNN @FoxNews @washingtonpost @nytimes
@TheFive @TheFive Hey Juan, your buddy @BarackObama did nothing about the Saudi's, why is it now you blame @realDonaldTrump ? Oh yeah, you are a blind fool for the @DNC @greggutfeld is correct, the left does not give a damn about the reporter, just blaming.
@BarackObama It is time. We need you Barack. Not as a figure head. Not as a party manager. Not as an Election chief. We Need You! We have a slow civil war on going now in this country. We have the most vile man this country has ever had in power tearing the country appart
Trump is the product of 8 years of @BarackObama 's divisive politics.
@BarackObama pls come back
How am I barely seeing this @BarackObama @KeyAndPeele pic.twitter.com/Sjuj3QnLD2
. @BarackObama is just a hard act to follow. #facts
@MTPDaily @chucktodd @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton who won Nevada could campaign for @RosenforNevada FL 27 @DonnaShalala Instead they're hiding out somewhere while Trump is working hard. If DT wins, this will be a black eye on the Dems leaders @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi pic.twitter.com/XxPmUxr38u
@BarackObama VOTE REPUBLICAN . Keep our country heading in the right direction
How's he know? He's not allowed to sit at the adults table anymore So, one of his pals like @BarackObama is leaking information to him 'illegally' This is why the @POTUS needs to pull all clearances for non active government personnel immediately and then let them reapply
I disagree....that honor goes to @BarackObama
She is describing @BarackObama to a tee. Lol
Dear @MichelleObama and @BarackObama - I'll be sharing 3 assemblies celebrating Black History Month for the children at my school tomorrow. We are grateful to you both for the inspiration you give. If you have words of support for our amazing students then please let me know :0)
Dems M.I.A. @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton who won Nevada could campaign for @RosenforNevada FL 27 @DonnaShalala Instead they're hiding out somewhere while Trump is working hard. If DT wins, this will be a black eye on the Dems leaders @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi pic.twitter.com/PMHGQvVFXS
@BarackObama You are definitely invited to our San Miguel Comer Reunion this Saturday--if you are in Chicago. These kids would love to see you again. So much has changed in all our lives since 2007! There will be cake! pic.twitter.com/L3lLzFtiwr
I miss you @BarackObama !!! pic.twitter.com/0Oc77d3paq
You spoke of no leader in the Democratic party. @BarackObama is a private citizen. If I were a Democratic candidate I would be asking him to campaign with me. Barack Obama speaks with a voice of reason. He can convince America to find our compassion & grace by voting 4 Democrats
