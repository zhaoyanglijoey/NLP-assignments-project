Its not that it was the funniest episode or anything - although, it was pretty damn funny - but, the #ComediansInCarsGettingCoffee with @BarackObama - WHILE HE WAS STILL IN OFFICE - was amazing. I guess $900M net worth allows you luxuries most people will never achieve.
@BarackObama I am happy I judged a book by its cover. I wake up and smell the miso soup.

Not a point, a question. I only wanted to know so I could address my response accordingly. Since you haven't served, I'll tell you, morale is a HUGE part of military service. @realDonaldTrump has done more for military morale in last year than @BarackObama did in 8 years.

Ugo @BarackObama was a man of stature and he did NOT demean/degrade the decency of the Presidency as is @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
@BarackObama were best for American future not Trump....
How many *Protected* accounts does @BarackObama Follow? It was more when he was @potus .

The @BarackObama admin failed to stop @DonaldTrump from winning in spite of spying on his campaign. Why? Because there's more Americans who love @POTUS and his ideas than those who hate America. #InvestigateObama
Ah yes, that old line. See the issue is @BarackObama had bad ideas ... like #DACA , #OBAMACARE and over regulation. Whereas @realDonaldTrump has good ideas like protecting our borders, reducing taxes for everyone ( #TaxReform ) and strengthening our stance in the world. Get it?
@BarackObama The scandal is that the Obama regime FBI, lacking the incriminating evidence needed to justify opening a criminal investigation of the @realDonaldTrump campaign, decided to open a counterintelligence investigation.
And this couldn't be resolved on @BarackObama 's watch.

I actually voted for @BarackObama . After 8 years of embarrassment it was easy to see that that he was just horrible. From the @FBI abuses under his watch, to the lying and crimes he let @HillaryClinton get away with, it's no surprise that Trump looks so good by comparison. #MAGA

Huh? You mean undoing everything @BarackObama did? Do you mean the most indictments in 17 months? Or the most porn stars that a President has slept with!

So, @BarackObama s Presidential Library is progressing. There should be a big savings for @realDonaldTrump s library. How much space do you need for a few Dick and Jane books and his tweets?
Not to spoil the speculation, but obviously for the #RoyalWedding @BarackObama is going to walk #meghanmarkle down the aisle.

If you do stay in power @realDonaldTrump for this first term at least we can all be thankful the next president will undo all the shit you've done (like you did all the good stuff done by @BarackObama )
Not surprised he's buying/selling stock--he'd sell his pecker too @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @tedlieu @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG @NormEisen
SMFH $3.00 a gallon are you serious? @POTUS more like POFSLHP! @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @EdKrassen @krassenstein #Watergate #lininghispockets #couldcarelessaboutus #blindfollowers
Okay Mr. @BarackObama . Now I'm not trying to stir up mess. I'm just saying tho. I was just pondering a little "deep state" offering to Madame Pele to spare Hilo... My friend Mel at Walter Reed told me to ask u to "do us a solid." pic.twitter.com/awoCOLqPRU
Show me where all that happened while @BarackObama was in office. And just FYI... I voted for him first time.
why cant @BarackObama or @HillaryClinton pay it?
Love this! Stealing! @BarackObama @JoeBiden - whenever you can slide in some advice - DO IT!
Mueller & Underwood, make sure this poc Judge in ED/VA is recused @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG

Dear Mr Lieu: Please contact @NancyPelosi @jack @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @SallyQYates and ask them to stop. Problem solved #WakeUpAmerica
Have to say 1 thing @JustinTrudeau can take Solis in is that he is just a little less incompetent then former pres @BarackObama . He doesn't realize @DonaldTrump Will remember this.
They should interrogate @HillaryClinton because we all know she's gonna snitch....right? @BarackObama
I 've said this before. Here it is again. Gina Haspel would be in prison if Obama, Pelosi & Reid had prosecuted Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Tenet, Gonzalez, AND Haspel and the many others who tortured people brutally. It is the truth. Don't even start alibiing. @BarackObama
Well hear this @SpeakerRyan Did U Crooked R's hold @BarackObama accountable, Yes U did. He had to work with a crooked red congress & All you R's refused to work with & @SenateDems Thanks to @SenateMajLdr & @HouseDemocrats Thanks to John & U!! So yes #Trumpo is responsible for All
Thank you, @realDonaldTrump , for making @BarackObama look better and better in comparison to you!
@BarackObama I asked you for help and YOU DID NOTHING! I finally got so mad at you and SWORE IN A WH note I sent to you and FINALLY HEARD BACK BUT STILL GOT NO HELP! AND YOU GAVE GUNS TO AL QUAEDA? YOU DISGUST ME AND I CAN'T WAIT TILL YOU ARE IN PRISON!
Frau Sucharewicz, Deutschland spricht #Israel nicht irgend ein Recht ab und schon gar nicht auf Selbstverteidigung. Dass #Netanjahu @BarackObama nicht zum Angriff gegen den #Iran treiben konnte und es jetzt bei #Trump versucht, ist aber offensichtlich. #Illner
See at this time when @BarackObama haunted the white house @GovMarkDayton and @amyklobuchar would be sending Minnesota National Guard to the Congo to "fight" Ebola. NO regard for human life. Now on the medical front, what is the world doing about this?
@HillaryClinton @BarackObama
#MSM #FakeNews paid for by @HillaryClinton @BarackObama #PayToPlay payoffs! President @realDonaldTrump fights for #AmericaFirst to help the U.S. The liberal Dems just finding ANYTHING to destroy President Trump, Lefties ARE FAILURES and they know it!
@POTUS @BarackObama thanks for the hookup fam #rattpack
I hope this is investigated, and if @BarackObama was responsible, then he is prosecuted under the law. When he said that there was no way you were going to win, something told him that his Gestapo were working to ensure that this happened . . .

The #LiberalMSM will do same thing with their BS #Journalism awards that @BarackObama is doing with his #NobelPeacePrize ... Lie about them... And some naive, stoned and starry-eyed hippy-chick will be all gaga abt it... Meanwhile, @realDonaldTrump is #GettinShitDone ...
Remember when the leftist media were laughing at @POTUS when he tweeted that @BarackObama Admin was spying on him? #CrossfireHurricane
Not good enough to come from Dems. I know you don't return evil for evil but surely @realDonaldTrump is destroying everything @BarackObama did regardless of merit. Why can't the @TheDemocrats give Trump a taste of his pudding?
We had a surprise visitor today! We've had Prime Ministers and Premiers at Daisy - but this was our first President. Thank you President @BarackObama for a productive meeting - enjoy the Daisies from Daisy! #ONpoli #JustATypicalThursday pic.twitter.com/2GI8rLaVoI
Other ways @BarackObama kept his #Science pledge with @WHOSTP44 . #stpf pic.twitter.com/AjcYp3W1Wo
he sealed his records at considerable expense before running for office. That tells you he's got things to hide. But he cannot seal records bought and pd for by the American Taxpayers. Nice try, @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/ifWSWQW2mX
First we enjoyed the Wisdom of @BarackObama then came the Wickedness of @realDonaldTrump
@BarackObama was President of the USA.. If he saw the Russians coming for the White House via YOU, he did his job. YOU denied Russian interference..refused SANCTIONS way too long..praising Putin while bashing Americans..kinda gave u away.
How about heading Schlossberg to prison @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker , anyone? @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @RepCummings @RepMaxineWaters @tedlieu @RepJoeKennedy @BarackObama @NewYorkStateAG

Dear Q, @POTUS et al... For the record, the day @BarackObama was elected, I wore black and went into mourning for 8 years. We might not have known the details, but We The People could see & feel our beloved country slipping away.WE thank God every day for @realDonaldTrump WWG1WGA pic.twitter.com/2N2s1wwIvi

I think the Obama family would be really interested in this story! Families of children with special needs are in dire straits and need your help and support. Military families! @MichelleObama @BarackObama @SenatorCardin @ChrisVanHollen @SidSaab @SpeakerBusch @SenWarren @Scotus
