@BarackObama It's ok ... Let it out (we already know) pic.twitter.com/AVctcxkYsT
Same as it was when @BarackObama was in office, in some cases a little less.
When I see @BarackObama I think, "Now there is a guy who thinks before he speaks." #POTUS
@BarackObama said "If you watch @FoxNews you are living on a different planet than you are if you, you know, listen to NPR." We have no update as E.T., The Extra-Terrestrial, could not be reached for a comment at this time.
@BarackObama says Fox News viewers live on another planet... maybe he needs to check the ratings and see most Americans are watching... #FoxNews

Well Trump say rest of world nobody fuck with United States of America, we not anymore weak country which was near @BarackObama now we are strong with @realDonaldTrump with #AmericaFirst
Merit= not black or brown. We need a president with merit, intelligence, class, and common sense. Wait a minute...we had that with @BarackObama . Is that why you are so jealous of Barack and @HillaryClinton ? Because they have all the character that you lack??
The 1st episode of @Letterman 's show #MyNextGuestNeedsNoIntroduction on @netflix is as much of a tribute to the icon @repjohnlewis and the March in Selma as it is an interview w/ #MyPresident @BarackObama #MLKWeekend #MLKDay #MLK
You ever listen to a song that was so good that it makes you feel like you're right there with that person? Well that's what it was like watching you speak with David Letterman. @BarackObama
I agree, Steve. #MyNextGuestNeedsNoIntroduction 's first episode was like sunbeams of intelligence, dignity, and grace pouring through the clouds of our current idiocracy. Kudos to @Letterman , @BarackObama , @repjohnlewis and @netflix for this extraordinary and powerful show.
The same "bubble economy" that @realDonaldTrump inherited from @BarackObama is now a soaring success (?)
Obama is the greatest usa president dead or alive Period. @Robert_Blair @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/mRAxQ7pBrI
Just started the @BarackObama @Letterman interview again but not before clicking through a @netflix message saying "Are you sure? This is your 4th time in 3 days. We offer plenty of other titles, you know." #MyNextGuestNeedsNoIntroduction
It's the economy, Comrade @BarackObama
If you haven't seen David Letterman's new show on Netflix, you have to watch it. He interviews @BarackObama and it's amazing. We were so blessed to have had him as our president. We definitely took it all for granted.
Pretty sure you have all seen it, but if you haven't - watch Letterman's interview of @BarackObama on Netflix.
Good thing I Was watching @FoxNews because @cnn @msnbc or none of the other Degenerate news Media has a clue on how to report the Truth &Lets Thank God For President @realDonaldTrump because the hole44 before him @BarackObama Lied Again To The People Of America pic.twitter.com/70II1y0gKM

Well @BarackObama does not get the credit he deserves. He saved our country from economic collapse.
We miss @BarackObama . And, when #Americans didn't have to feel shame.
@benfergusonshow - U are such a JOKE & a #MORON like @realDonaldTrump ...U always blame @BarackObama , who u couldnt hold a candle to. U keep forgetting that @BarackObama saved US from a DEPRESSION caused by @GOP & handed #MORON @realDonaldTrump a HUGE GIFT!!!
Miss him as prez @csims7_sims . Watched a "drop the mic" compilation of @BarackObama on YouTube yesterday. Tired of this cheeto at the helm. #MCO435

I CANNOT believe that as a convicted FELON that this person would be allowed to run for any political office!! @BarackObama should NEVER have communted her 35 year sentence in the first place! A traitor to our country, a disgrace to whatever gender she is!
This is a game 2 this man, I have got 2 stop allowing him to yank my chain. Now, exactly how do I do that. Not responding to him directly on twitter? I've began to do that, it's just one less tweet for him to add to his Twitter #. Instead, I'm gonna bounce @BarackObama instead.
watching the @BarackObama interview on #Letterman 's new @netflix series. so good. pic.twitter.com/XfWcgOcvw6
Just watched My Next Guest w/ David Letterman on Netflix. I'm in tears. Grateful to see a President on television who could speak well, could make jokes without degrading others & who didn't disgrace himself, the office or our country. Thank you @BarackObama
Watching #DavidLetterman show on @netflix with @BarackObama Thank you for forever engraving #yeswecan in my Spirit. Even today, in spite of everything, YES WE CAN! #grateful
It should have ended when he mocked a disabled reporter. Or when he insisted @BarackObama was not an American citizen. Or when...oh hell, it should have never started.
Sounds like @BarackObama what a POS
That Netflix show with David Letterman featuring @BarackObama made me tear up because I realize how much I miss him. I long for a time when our president was calm, pleasant, informed and respectful. Those were the good old days I thought would never end.
do squirrels taste like potato bread? @AskDotCom @askjcp @BarackObama
If you support @GrumpySkeletor you can't cheer for He-man If you support Jedis, you can't love the Emperor If you rate @BarackObama you can't think @realDonaldTrump is a good swap If you support @jeremycorbyn who is supporting Brexit as policy you can't be a remainer Simples

Do you want to know why @realDonaldTrump did NOTHING when the accidental missle alert went out in #Hawaii ? It's his EXTREME PASSIVE AGGRESSION and complete lack of true LEADERSHIP! Oh and @Hawaii_EMA looks after @BarackObama 's home state!
@Letterman Currently viewing your new @netflix show. After a year of FUD and churlish behaviour out of Washington, D.C, @BarackObama 's and your intelligent conversation about life, culture, and politics is so beautifully adult. An absolute win for #Netflix , and I'll be watching.

@JoyAnnReid do you think Democrates would pass something @BarackObama didn't approve of ???? #hypocrisy

Watching my president @BarackObama on David Letterman is triggering.
All the credit goes to @BarackObama . You could take some credit if you could sustain the economy for another 3 years and not fall into another recession with reckless decisions.
infrastructure? I am sure that if @BarackObama had a plan the GOP led Congress would have acted on it. Where is the Dems stance on climate change? Oh, wait... They were silent after Sandy Hook and Las Vegas, right? No stances on Iraq or Afghanistan? Trade?
The left didn't mind this, I guess? @BarackObama calling @netanyahu , "Chickenshit" Especially considering everything.... #Hypocrisy #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder pic.twitter.com/BbGOWBuVu7

The trains just kept delivering Central American children and @BarackObama had them shipped to Conservative regions like Nebraska to water things down. Who will determine who is #DACA and who is illegal DEMOCRAT Train Lift?
Donald Trump has successfully divided this nation. As a country, we are smarter & better than this...WAKE UP before it's too late! @MichelleObama @BarackObama @Oprah #nationdivided #OneNationUnderGod #WhenTheyGoLowWeGoHigh
@BarackObama just in case he wants to speak at the graduation for our How To Not Be A Mansplaining Jerk certificate program. Fingers crossed ;)
You have to give credit where it is due, in order to receive credit when it is due unto you. One who expects credit without acknowledging anyone elses successes, is a sign of Narcissism. You need to Thank @BarackObama for handing you an improving economy & huge wall street gains
So let me get this straight. @BarackObama says ABC and cohorts in MSM are the "real" news when they are reporting 93% negative on @POTUS but @FoxNews who reports 50/50 is the one not in reality! Oh okay, thanks for letting us know Obama! What a POS you are, thank God your gone!!
The first episode of David @Letterman 's #MyNextGuest , which features a conversation with @BarackObama , is equal parts introspective and charming. @aherman2006 : http:// therin.gr/DQ406Fr

So will . @BarackObama or . @HillaryClinton be replacing . @jack ?
Why would we condemn it? Its spot-on accurate. Just like when @BarackObama called Libya a s***show. Same thing.

Hey, @BarackObama how do you like @realDonaldTrump 's magic wand!
Oh, for the sweet days of @BarackObama , when I was not held to account by black cab drivers as to why a madman runs my country, who came that close to winning the popular vote because of (insert explanation demanded here), and what fresh hell is this electoral college palaver??
I wonder what @BarackObama is doing
"If you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet" Is @BarackObama telling the truth?
Kim is now talking with South Korea, and Russia & China are finally actually helping us with sanctions. @realDonaldTrump methods are working. Russia and China see we are no longer doing what @BarackObama did, which was put on lipstick and bend over.
More lies. @BarackObama @POTUS44 was the best thing that happened to America. @POTUS was the worst thing that ever happened to America
@BarackObama I was currently scammed. The scammers told me they would aid in my 23,000 dollars worth of debt and by the way, this is the second time I have run into scammers trying to pay off student loans. Now I currently have zero dollars in both my checking and savings account
@BarackObama missing you sir always AntnewTimes Antonio
@BarackObama fears fading into obscurity; & he & @HillaryClinton meant what she said about a basket of deplorables; he's just saying it in a different way.

Blah blah blah from one kiss up guy to you! Means nothing! The stock market had already turned around & has been on a steady upward trend while @BarackObama was in office! This is all going to catch up with you! History tells the full story

Remember if Obama didnt leave the economy would have NEVER improved. So thank you @BarackObama for leaving so that @realDonaldTrump could fix your screw ups.

Thank you, @BarackObama .
@BarackObama You have caused a lot of problems in this country. Why? I'm not sure yet but you caused more racial division than any President. Shame on you! You should be supporting Trump for the sake of the USA
@BarackObama please come back. I miss you so much. Why did you have to leave us with the orange goblin??
@BarackObama Being a parent has been the greatest pleasure of my life.

@MSNBC I am disappointed, appalled, & a little ticked. Around 3:40 CST a panel was asked about England & embassy. The host talk like it was real that @BarackObama sold the embassy. The truth should be said-Although @POTUS claims the embassy was @POTUS44 doing, no mention was Bush

@BarackObama can I vent to you? b/c I want to study abroad, but I'm unsure b/c I'm also in an organization that I want to be president of someday and I'm afraid that leaving for a year will put me back at the starting line for that position. What do you think I should do?

I don't remember loving a POTUS more, after he left office, w/ the exception of @BarackObama
@BarackObama On the other hand, David Letterman is an institution, but he was never president of the United States. A little pompous of him to act as though you two are comparable.

Horrible screwup but no real actual damage in Hawaii. World's largest terrorist funder @BarackObama flew in $2.0 billion worth of greenbacks on massive palettes to islamonazis in Iran, but meh. I guess that had no effect becs no one jumped down a manhole (er, personhole).

@realDonaldTrump there is another shit hole that you forgot to mention, that is the #DeepState & these politicians who hate the Constitution @HillaryClinton @RepMaxineWaters @elizabethforma @SenWhitehouse @BarackObama @JimLangevin @GovMalloyOffice
I got really wistful listening to @BarackObama clip. God, I miss him.
For whatever reason all his pertinent records are either sealed or fraudulent. I'm sure there's an obvious explanation but to date @BarackObama hasn't had to supply one!
