@BarackObama Thank GOD for President TRUMP. A REAL PRESIDENT AND A TRUE LEADER.
@BarackObama how come you follow @TJTambourine and you don't follow me? That's not cool, man.
Well it is quite offensive to @BarackObama 's legacy!

Thank you @BarackObama for bringing down the unemployment rate and handing a great economy to Trump.
@BarackObama wanna play fortnite?
President Trump brings home 3 prisoners from a death camp in N.Korea and gets ridiculed by the #fakenews media @cnn @msnbc @huffpost @abc @BarackObama brings back deserter Bergdahl in exchange for ISIS prisoners and gets a heroes welcome from the #fakenews media That's the @DNC
Thanks @BarackObama for the belated birthday wishes. pic.twitter.com/FHNVeE0rva
Pretty sure @BarackObama never greeted returned captives with praise for their captor, either.
@BarackObama reduced unemployment rate from 7.8 percent to 4.8 percent by the time he left.

@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama was responsible for the release of 11 prisoners from North Korea, 3 from Iran and 53 from Cuba Not a single photo op
@realDonaldTrump you shouldn't put a price on a human life pfffffffff!!! So what if @BarackObama paid to get prisoners released, the whole of America was behind him at the time.
1. Fake news means news that is untrue. 2. It is to share truth, not distract from anything. 3. You mean the 3 prisoners @realDonaldTrump said @BarackObama couldn't free, even though 2 of them were not captured until 45 was pres? 4. Please change your name to No Sense #Facts
Fake President @BarackObama yes #Trump has time to let the crowd boo him #MAGA

Thanks to @BarackObama
Sure she is Because @CNN is Part of the Cover UP for @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton LOOKS more Like Fear of being Caught & Her Name being on the Criminal Name List that President @realDonaldTrump
@BarackObama Will Obama give praise to Trump for: 3 hostages released, 5 Isis leaders captured, N. Korea meeting set. Obama- worthless and worst potus. Trump 2020!
@realDonaldTrump @StephenMilIer Hey Barry. @BarackObama where is your IRANIAN coin?
Watching @realDonaldTrump at Indiana rally & actually feel like America is back!!! No more weakness, corruption, being shamed to rest of world by that faux president @BarackObama !! God Bless America. Land that I love. Stand beside her and guide her...Thank you Mr. President!
A few more and he'll be caught up to @BarackObama
@BarackObama Since when is a deal signed by only one side a deal?
Love it! Love it! Especially seeing @BarackObama and @MichelleObama break it down for you @TheEllenShow :-)
@BarackObama once said elections have consequences.
@RealJamesWoods Mueller probe, Comey, media frenzy against @realDonaldTrump are a last gasp and reaction to the daily dismantling of the @BarackObama legacy. Plain and simple!
You just keep fawning over the image you've created of @BarackObama , and I'll stick to the reality. No politician gives a crap about you. You're a vote. A piggy bank. A means to an end. They all self-promote to get and retain power. Stop romanticizing it.
@SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/XFqd0acFzB
Am I the only one who remembers the criticism @BarackObama received for trying to have a dialogue with Cuba? Somehow @realDonaldTrump is now a superhero? Diplomacy is always the better option. Even with Iran; a country we had an agreement with.
What we oughta do is trade that pr!ck @BarackObama for any future hostages.
@BarackObama Another vacation?! I thought you were on one long unending vacation paid for by us the taxpayers
It is a continuation of the growth that Obama stimulated after the disastrous Bush years. Thank you @BarackObama .
Under @BarackObama , 11 prisoners were released from North Korea, and he didn't require a photo-op and applause like our man-baby @realDonaldTrump ... #ThatTrumpSmell #BeBest pic.twitter.com/TT30znK5pC
I wonder if Ed recalls how many terrorists @BarackObama released from Gitmo that went BACK into terror?
Trump is definitely gambling on this issue to come to an agreement like North Korea, but @BarackObama you have nothing to say about this, you gave many green lights to tear down the nations in middle east and for what?. You only made those oil companies rich. Shame

@ProudResister This is TRUMP ERA! The worst time of our lives! A good and decent US President would condemn that immediately just like @SenJohnMcCain condemned when his supporters talked shit on @BarackObama but not this President. He's loving this more than anything..
@BarackObama would have fired the person instantly hit Trump us no moral compass or ethical values. He only cares about himself.

Once @NobelPrize gave one to @BarackObama it lost ALL its value and prestige. So who cares. A swift and mighty re-election is better. A forceful Conservative ass kicking in the Senate and House would be more appropriate
Uh except @BarackObama got this ball rolling years ago. Trump had nothing to do with Elkhart jobs returning

As opposed to the socialists favoritism that we have had for the last 8 years under the @BarackObama 's administration reign of anti-American sentiment? READ OUR LIPS! AMERICANS DON'T WANT THE DEMOCRATIC VERSION OF SOCIALISM! If you can't understand then GET THE HELL OUT OF OFFICE
@BarackObama you are a nice president
I bet you @BarackObama watches #brooklyn99 & this is why he's a better president than Trumpf. This wouldn't have happened under his presidency #RenewB99
It's now clear why @realDonaldTrump is getting so much done. He spends no time kissing ass and apologizing for American excellence. @BarackObama spent all his time kissing globalists ass and plotting to destroy America.
Please help I'm in a sunken place. @BarackObama
We will fix it once @SenJohnMcCain is dead... hopefully soon enough ...he did a great job funding #isis with @BarackObama
When @BarackObama was president 11 prisoners were released from #NorthKorea . Not any photo ops! #ClassNotAss

I'm agreed with him. The only thing that @BarackObama did well was to eliminate the law of dried feet, wet feet. If God wants, @POTUS will quit The Cuban Adjustment Act which is used for @RaulCastroR of Cuba for to send spies & enemies of USA that are economy dependents forever.

He would if he could. @realDonaldTrump has a seriously strong case of obsession with @BarackObama
@BarackObama as a @USSenate member and a candidate contributed to the disaster. He doesn't get "credit" for that. He laughed at @SenJohnMcCain when he said, let's go back to Washington and fix this. Obama is, therefore, disgraceful.
Anything involving @BarackObama is a good thing!

@BretBaier you might ask your Democratic guest how many hostages did @JohnKerry and @BarackObama got released in the Iran deal? 00000000
Trump lied? I am not fan of Trump but you are a HUGE liar along with your good buddy James Clapper. And it was not a DEAL you idiot. It was done by executive fiat. Meaning Trump did not break any deal. Congress did not vote on it. That is your former boss ( @BarackObama ) fault.
Just out of curiosity, how many times did @BarackObama 's lawyer sell access to him? #jefftoobin says everybody does it all the time, strange I don't remember any issues with that with BHO.

And shame on you @barackobama for expanding patriot act with no checks or balances on the execution. Sorry I voted for you twice . No sarcasm here.
@StephenAtHome dumbass, you do realize that many Dems were against the Iran Deal, along with majority of Americans. The Iranians lied and spit in our faces. We backed out of @BarackObama 's deal, NOT @realDonaldTrump 's deal. New deal will be good for America & the world.
