@BarackObama i miss you
No one is going to believe me but Monday morning I was going to ask @BarackObama and @JoeBiden to make another video and here it is...
Former President @BarackObama endorses 81 candidates in U.S. #midterms , says he's 'eager' to get involved https:// usat.ly/2LRbOVk via @usatoday @DNC @OurRevolution #VoteBlue2018
@BarackObama
What was really shocking was how far @BarackObama Intel Gang went in abusing their power & breaking laws to illegally spy & attempt to entrap US Citizens. @FBI @CIA @TheJusticeDept BUSTED.
@ThePerezHilton @princessfemme @paladine @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @MichaelAvenatti @AdamSchiffCA @rcam55569 @chrislhayes Read Perez blog, good scoops! Boom

@BarackObama you are no longer president, nothing gets people to the polls to vote red like your endorsement. #MagicWand https:// youtu.be/DuhXkCF-L2E
@BarackObama hey
This is obama's civil war in USA. @BarackObama @DHSgov @DeptofDefense @FBI @TheJusticeDept @USAGSessions @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP
@BarackObama Word has it that you've got a campaign. What is it?
I have missed @BarackObama and @MichelleObama too. Very much. But, anyone who faulted their need to take a break, enjoy life and each other after that 8 years, just needed to take a breath. We knew they'd show up. And @JoeBiden also.
BECAUSE it was @BarackObama AND he hid lots from the American people..you know that TRANSPARENT Presidency he spoke about. Was a bunch of BS.
Dear Mr President @BarackObama - you missed one very important candidate @WilliamsForMT !
@BarackObama Barack is back! #hardball pic.twitter.com/qZPt6oOwUn
That Is Excellent, Mr. President. @BarackObama spent $10 Trillion in debt buildup to grow government & dump billions to prop up Wall Street & maintain what he called a 'jobless recovery'. He & leftwing globalists then spent money advertising the virtues of unemployment! #NoShame
Include @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama in your report too
As a happily married woman I don't know who I am more in love with: @KingJames or @BarackObama . These men represent the best in America and the basic decency that has represented the greatness of America before @realDonaldTrump brought forth his hate, his lying, his treason.
Who cares what @BarackObama endorses. This is what America wants to see Vice President Pence Delivers Remarks at an Honorable Carry Ceremony https:// youtu.be/3PBlPticJPM
#WhyIJoinedTwitter originally?! Oh boy! I think it was for the same reason people use Yelp! And to follow @BarackObama @Shannon_Penn @drchrisbrown @drlisachimes @bomani_jones @Liam_J_McIntyre ...If we're being honest. And on that note pic.twitter.com/aVRxowz8h6
@claydumas was part of Ashtabula County in 2008 and 2012 when @apooltoswim worked with Clay on the @BarackObama campaigns here. We can, and did, win in those elections, and we'll win this one!
@BarackObama congratulates @KingJames for opening a new FREE school while @POTUS twitters out insults. BHO & LJ are MAGA. Not trump. SAD.
@washingtonpost can you tell me how many times @BarackObama has lied since he was in office. Rick Santorum said he told lies, whoppers is what he said.
#Obama endorses three #MaineDemocrats running for state Senate https://www. pressherald.com/?p=1481654 - #ThankyouObama !! @barackObama We truly appreciate your support! #MEpolitics
Just saw a rat tail. On a living, breathing grown-ass man. In the year 2018. He's also wearing a giant, garish gold chain and a jean jacket. Thanks, @BarackObama .
Its absolute desperation ... could you imagine the outcry if @BarackObama stepped in and tried to stop any of the #Benghazi investigations (as spurious as they were) #hypocrisygames
@BarackObama you should stay in your birth country, Kenya pic.twitter.com/ePdhUBdFpc
@BarackObama yanny or 3rd term?
Este es mi Presidente. He is my President. @BarackObama
Pro-tip: Stop with 'the Senate continued to fail' & GET REAL. It's the @GOP TRAITOR-TRUMP, PUTIN-ENABLING Senate that CONTINUED to implement its unrelenting attack on OUR DEMOCRACY & Secured Voting. cc @MarkWarner @SenatorBurr @FBI @BarackObama @KamalaHarris #TrumpRussia
Interesting way the first legalsmerenman @ApprenticeNBC 101 true together sale time as publicly deal with @BarackObama gave the FBI are 5.0-man-Aeghania less threat to the YOU. Inde; Erions at CNN: Hucrary, Virginia Oward Russia, but Ted Cuvay.
But I thought Russia and Trump were in on it? #WakeUpAmerica IT WAS @DNC @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @JohnBrennan @SallyQYates ETAL.
Yes, @BarackObama spread that 'wealth' in the pockets of the weaponindustry.. #Irak #Afghanistan #Politics
Did @BarackObama get this kind of recognition every time growth was over 4%? Deficit is growing, wages are stagnant, inflation is climbing, layoffs are being announced, and the rich are getting richer. #GOPTaxScam #CA23
Because there was no way to confirm the child belonged to the adult they arrived with, or the parent had a violent criminal record. @BarackObama released children to traffickers
She's not though, right?! @Ocasio2018 Upper middle class; father's architect (or lawyer). Another phony like @BarackObama hiding her past!
@BarackObama Will u plz run as Joe Biden's Vice President I WILL work harder than either of u will have to.Plz we need EXPERIENCE to undo all this Clown is DESTROYING Ur the People's President Ur our last hope 2 stop PUTIN #BIDEN /OBAMA2020 #BLUEWAVE WE NEED U TY 4 ALL U DO
What about when @BarackObama said he visited 57 states. You never reported on that
Yep, those are the classy Trumpsters. God, I miss @BarackObama
@BarackObama Miss you and Michelle Mr. President!
Child marriage disproportionately affects girls and has an impact on their mental and physical health for the rest of their lives. #endchildmarriage @Omojuwa @UNICEF @MBuhari @BarackObama @MalalaFund pic.twitter.com/NUFqxZcKhr
Is it funded? Funny....when @BarackObama tried to combat the opioid crisis, the @GOP was no where to be found, and what you did allow, you didn't give funding for. The #GOPTaxScam is creating deficit and gutting health insurance, while making the rich richer #ComplicitGOP #CA23
Don't forget to remind Rick Santorum that @FoxNews picked on @BarackObama for 8 friggin years!! Or did he forget? #OutFront
I just realized that Hank Hill and @BarackObama had the same wallpaper. pic.twitter.com/5YTfQfGuzw
I'm sick of winning. Can we have @BarackObama back?
go and take your little wonder wand @BarackObama and disappear into the woods with crooked Hilary & then you may give the Dems some chance of reforming themselves. the @realDonaldTrump is kicking ass on the economy & trade & improving the lives of millions!
i wish @BarackObama would run in 2020. he'd get my vote! he's, as they say, tanned (heh), rested, and ready! i suppose michelle would shit a kitten but hey, the country needs strong honest brilliant humane inspiring leadership again.
@BarackObama needs to do more in 2018. Asleep at the switch in the 2010 elections is part of what got us here. And I love the guy...
Deport Farrakhan and all radical imams. @DHSgov @GOP @DeptofDefense @VP @TheDemocrats @BarackObama
@BarackObama Happened upon BET and the last musical performance with you and Michelle in the White House. You said "it will be alright" after you left. Sadly, it's not. You are still my President. I refuse to accept the horror of this time in history. But, we shall overcome.
Mankind's ability to watch this and ignore it because it's not happening to them is distressing. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @NATO @UN if only we cared again. #Syria #bbcnews
Or @Ocasio2018 sat with @SenSanders watching old @BarackObama reruns ...
Roster Lock: Team name- goth boi click. We out here with @elonmusk @BarackObama @steevejobs And sub: @hanselrl RLRS INCOMING!!
Re-Tweet if you would like to see @BarackObama hold a town hall meeting to show the @GOP what a real American loving crowd looks like!
@BarackObama @NSAGov @SecretService when the pimp of los angeles is agreed upon then my people will print the money and the new system will begin like we always have with standard Secret Service protocols from before like its boring this way we tried we continue AIME we win AIME
@BarackObama check out brandy k chambers for hd 112 in TX for an endorsement. http://Www. brandychambers.com We need all the help
Thank @BarackObama that I'm still covered by my mom's health insurance, because my poor 24-year-old body requires multiple doctors at the moment.
Yep, @Ocasio2018 is spoiled girl wanting to be "bad" just like @BarackObama : "if they bring knife to fight, we bring gun." classy!
You remain an inspiration @BarackObama . Thank you very much. I look forward to seeing you face to face very soon. I love you.
A little bit frustrated tonight but it's the past... @BarackObama a friend showed me letters you replied back to her.... U never once answered my letters
I also remember democrats protecting @BarackObama when he drew a red line in Syrian that ended up killing 10000 innocent people, 3000 of them children. The democrats were silent on that and put their collective heads in the sand!
@BarackObama why are you not supporting Gov Tom Wolf, Scott Wallace in PA 1, and, Helen Tai in Pa Assembly 178.
@BarackObama read your endorsement list. You missed two women, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY) and Jamie McLeod Skinner (OR CD 2). Jamie is planning on defeating horrible Greg Walden. Please endorse! Turn Oregon BLUE! Thank you!
Congrats to @AftabPureval on your big endorsement from @BarackObama ! Oh1 is part of the #bluewave !
Breakin News: @BarackObama and @JoeBiden are @DaftPunkUnchd
THREAD: There's been a lot of excitement over @BarackObama 's endorsements today and I thought I would share a little bit more about how much his endorsement means to me. #copolitics #coleg (1/10) pic.twitter.com/cN937ynamT
Not that it matters a damn but what does @BarackObama think. If roles were reversed he'd be outraged. @realDonaldTrump should send peace keepers then count to 10 and then send troops!
@BarackObama you and Bill Clinton are the only last Presidents that don't want to give it up. Your 15 minutes of fame are over. And lease keep up the candidate endorsements. Now I know they do lose
Damn I was hoping @BarackObama would lose his passport in Somalia and be banned from traveling to the USA
@BarackObama We miss you Brother. Peace and Love to you and your family.
Be assured, @realdonaldtrump & his MASTER @PutinRF_Eng , have NEVER faced the consequences of attacking American Patriots. They now will. If they had any sense, they'd ponder #Gettysburg & the #NormandyBeaches & #IwoJima before proceeding. cc @FBI @BarackObama @EricHolder
ReTweet if you would like to see @BarackObama hold a town hall meeting to show the @GOP what a real American loving crowd looks like!
@BarackObama please sir i need a scholarship through your foundation for my phd profram in cyber security in the US
#YesWeCan happy early birthday related birthday @BarackObama
@BarackObama & @MichelleObama , please consider also endorsing Audrey Denny ( @audrey4congress ) in CA-1 who is running against Doug LaMalfa.We must unseat LaMalfa who votes to impose stricter restrictions on SNAP & other assistance for the poor while he gladly takes farm subsidies.
I can't believe I found out a former law school classmate is running for NC State House by seeing her endorsement from @BarackObama . GO, SYDNEY BATCH!
So funny #Trump is intimidated by #Obama @BarackObama can't help it he's great & well-liked & @realDonaldTrump , well, you know
@BarackObama TESORO! DID U TAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF EVERYTHING TODAY! U KNOW HOW GTA IS! HE IS DEMANDING! PRECISION...ALL THE THINGS THAT HE WILL TEACH US! OH BOY! BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY! NOT MAN'S BUT GTA'S UNIVERSITY UNIVERSE..THE FORCE, THE MIND & THE VOICE! UN BACIO!
@BarackObama endorse @BetoORourke and go to Texas
@BarackObama Dear MR. President, I am in Lost Vegas NV. We need your vibrance, energy, Integrity and your charm here.. that is if you can stop by and campaign here. I would be glad.
@BarackObama has always been Hindu phobic . We are glad that @realDonaldTrump was voted in
O.k. o.k. but please, let this happen. Let's just squash the entire @BarackObama legacy. I hope @JoeBiden runs, trips, and falls on his hair-plugged face. #MAGA #TrumpVJoe2020 https:// politi.co/2n04qsv
@HardballChris Where's your outrage about @BarackObama going to So Africa to throw his racist fuel on white genocide there?! Get tingle?!
I must say @JoeBiden always had @BarackObama back , now matter whaT..IT WENT BOTH WAYs BETWEEN THEM...Y'ALL REMEMBER , we haven't forgot...
@BarackObama mi vida pero la reina isabel de inglaterra sabe muy bien de mi de mi humildad mi conocimiento y trayectoria durante toda mi vida sobre mi fe habitos y costumbres
First round of POTUS @BarackObama endorsements. I hope there are more coming! pic.twitter.com/qUcVywCHyU

Congratulations to @HarleyRouda on the endorsement for on @BarackObama !!!! It was hard earned and deeply deserved!!! #RideWithHarley #BlueWave #VoteForYourLife pic.twitter.com/dlgIEuZ4Cp
When we felt safe, kindness, and hope. We gotta take it back. This has been a wake up call like no other. We cannot for 1 second be asleep at the wheel. Vote blue! Thank @BarackObama and his family for showing us how good it can be.
. @jonfavs - just finished your #CrookedConversations with @brhodes . I burned to a CD @BarackObama 's 2008 New Hampshire speech & the song by @iamwill to put with the text of both in #grade3 listening center for struggling readers. It was one most popular all year. #wordsmatter
Please @BarackObama I know you'd rather not, but this democracy really needs your support at a moment like this. We miss you and your family so much!
Did @BarackObama endorse @BetoORourke ??? Seems like a no-brainer.
Okay frauds, why now? Why not during @BarackObama administration? You clowns are fooling nobody.
Ay, @BarackObama ...did you ever need an attorney during your presidency? Just asking for America.
@BarackObama Yow my President we need the senate too have a great day WE love you
@BarackObama This is what a TRUE PRESIDENT does.. RESPECT GOD NOT CONDEMN HIM!!! But your party wouldn't know what Christianity is but more over you "unleash" your far left loud mouths like @RepMaxineWaters who can't shut her mouth up. We're about fairness but she blasts us.
@BarackObama I'm sorry Mr. President, but I can't let this go. Why aren't you supporting @BetoORourke ?
@BarackObama @MichelleObama I miss you. #RelationshipGoals
@BarackObama @JoeBiden I think you guys should keep showing up at random places in DC, it was great seeing you
By the way @HardballChris @realDonaldTrump doesn't have 80M followers either...as #RudyGiuliani said. #trump has 53M, @BarackObama has 103M. @katyperry has 106M @justinbeiber has 104M @rhianna has 86M @ArianaGrande has 56M...
Another day another tweet storm. I miss you . @MichelleObama & @BarackObama Your words and examples help me weather the storm that is Trump America. #TheResistance #StrongerTogether #Resist pic.twitter.com/gnXQAqESLi
How do you feel about @BetoORourke out of Texas @BarackObama
