You was truly one of the best president we had here @BarackObama

@BarackObama your in a class of your own sir.
@BarackObama The World misses you!
I'm 10 min into @netflix #MyNextGuest and holy shit do I miss @BarackObama
The @letterman interview of @BarackObama is a great way to observe MLK day.
Just watched #Letterman interview @BarackObama . So wonderful. I really identified with Obama's description of Malia leaving home - 'it's like open heart surgery'
U would think so but Washington is so fucked up it doesn't matter. And sorry if anyone is offended but he/she is disgusting and def has mental issues. God job @BarackObama u commuted a traitor to this country but one traitor to another we now understand. Good Iranian deal
@BarackObama made it worse
Our fight was over with @BarackObama we had won!@realDonaldTrump is bringing the fight back. Taking our win. Taking money away from this state, taking jobs, taking money that should be used for the opium epidemic to go after people for marijuana!
Fortunately, @POTUS is beginning 2 restore respect 4 police that @BarackObama nearly DESTROYED!
So today, on the DL at work I was trying to retweet anything for #KevinProbably . Not wanting to neglect work they were usually just quick glances. One time when I looked I thought I read that I was being followed by @BarackObama . You can't imagine my excitement...
@BarackObama Thank You
@BarackObama change your profile to past president. You are the president of nothing anymore! Get over yourself!! We're not gonna take your sh*t anymore!!

It was always #Congress ' job to pass #DACA instead of @BarackObama illegal EO.
When @BarackObama was in office in 2011, only 30% of white evangelicals told pollsters that they would forgive a president's immoral behavior. Now under @realDonaldTrump it's 72%. source: PPRI Polling, NYT ##GOPhypocrisy #Hypocrites #shitholePresident #DumpTrumpsRacism #resist
We will never see trump doing something like this. Thinks it is beneath him. @BarackObama - always my President! We miss you terribly!
Thank You Mr. President... We miss you @BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama it saddens me that the hate is so palpable, even when you are making a statement about a brave man who gave himself in love.
Hi @BarackObama
Thank you & i love this. Thank You @_POTUS44_ @BarackObama for your continued & stable compassion for all of humanity & mother earth.
After listening and watching a @BarackObama interview, how can you NOT be inspired to get politically involved? I wish I was actually qualified to run for office
Hats off to you Keith ... Thank you for standing up for @BarackObama the man America knows well that @realDonaldTrump continues to diminish at every turn ... No man in America is depised more than #tRump .. And no president in history has been more divisive towards her citizens
Using this clearly flawed logic if you can even call it that I guess we can blame @BarackObama for the thousands of murders in #Chicago during his presidency!!! #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
To all of.my friends and family. Please remember that today we celebrate MLK and all Americans who have fought to make sure our civil rights is a going concern for all Americans. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama
Excited about the forthcoming @BarackObama Presidential Center https://www. obama.org/the-center/ via @ObamaFoundation
Missing @BarackObama as much as we are? Spend 89 minutes with him in a 'Trump-free' White House. #TheFinalYear is in cinemas January 19. pic.twitter.com/CgJGuk5RIu
Is there any loopholes in our electoral system to #BringBackObama ? I would love to have @BarackObama and @JoeBiden back in the @WhiteHouse #obamabiden2020
Sensacional a entrevista do @BarackObama pro @Letterman nesse baita programa do Dave.
@BarackObama You were an amazing president. I'm disgusted by who runs the US now. I'm Canadian, so I guess I don't have a say, but even J.K. Rowling posts about you. It's fucking disgusting the person who took office after you. Maybe you can back back Bernie @BernieSanders
. @ChrisCuomo You can dismiss the EVIDENCE, disdain the PEOPLE, but as of TODAY - January 15, 2018 - the birth certificate @BarackObama presented has been found FRAUDULENT by reputable researchers on TWO CONTINENTS. SO-YOU & @CNN is exposed for cover-up. #IWasntaBirtherInBeginning
Spent part of this #MLKJrDay watching the new Letterman interview with @BarackObama on Netflix. What a great start for a new show.
@BarackObama Your book 'Dreams from My Father' is such an inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story with the world. Will you consider reading the story of my life? Annie's Choice: The Story of a Five Year Old Boy Abandoned in Mexico... http:// annies-choice.com
You're a disgrace to white people. @BarackObama was an American citizen. Racism is in your DNA & must be uprooted with blood of Jesus. You don't belong in Congress. White supremacy is a disease.
@SenatorDurbin is MY Senator. Shut up-sit down and act like a real President. Google @BarackObama and @BillClinton - they were REAL presidents
#SpecialReport Where's the outrage when @BarackObama called Libya a s---show or when @LindseyGrahamSC called Mexico & CA nations hellholes?
As a proud father, I can relate! Watching your kids go off to college is equally amazing & difficult, @BarackObama . http:// bit.ly/2Dp2LUY pic.twitter.com/eaEIb96c5u
@BarackObama we miss you Mr. President!
@BarackObama @SenBobCasey @BarbraStreisand @sunny :It WAS a no-brainer until"no-brainer"entered the WH-if you're born here YOU'RE A CITIZEN!
How cool would it be if @BarackObama followed me back.... #onlydreaming #oneday #MotivationMonday
Just come back. You too @BarackObama
RT @BarackObama : Dr. King was 26 when the Montgomery bus boycott began. He started small, rallying others who believed their efforts mattered, pressing on through challenges and doubts to change our world for the better. A permanent inspiration for the rest of us...
Stop it! You're making me all teary-eyed thinking about how much I miss @BarackObama
@Barackobama May 19, 1998
Past presidents have performed civic work & community service on past MLK days. But not @realDonaldTrump , he spent the day golfing. Didn't he criticize @BarackObama for golfing too much? #MLKDay pic.twitter.com/QDs1DpxVJR
I put together some photos of how past presidents commemorated #MLKDay . @realDonaldTrump , @POTUS , played golf. cc: @PressSec @WhiteHouse @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/p5jRej37Nx
@BarackObama President, plz use Echelon to find out who is controlling yakuza to assassinate civilians in Japanese diet. #radiko #cnn #bbc

Damn it if @barackobama doesn't still walk like a cat. And awesome, brilliant, classy cat. My Next Guest Needs No Introduction @letterman
@dbongino @PeteHegseth What do you guys think we would learn if we heard details of private conversations of @FoxNewsSunday host Chris Wallace? That weasel prob watches kiddie porn. How about @chuckschumer ? Endless hypocrisy. How about @BarackObama ? (Gurgling /sucking sounds)
@BarackObama your legacy Barry! Your mess!
OMG @BarackObama on Letterman's @netflix show is giving me life. "If you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet...than you are if you listen to @NPR ." #ComeBackToUs

@ilanwurman right now. Was what @BarackObama did with #DACA constitutional? http:// woai.com/listen
i miss him every day, but i especially miss @BarackObama on holidays like today, when he consistently set an example by publicly exhibiting the utmost respect for people like MLK #MLKDay
"For when we have faced down impossible odds, when we've been told we're not ready or that we shouldn't try or that we can't, generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can." @BarackObama
A good one to watch today. Well done @netflix @BarackObama & @DavidLetternan http:// bit.ly/2D67lXi #mynextguest #MLKDay

Saw that David Letterman @netflix show with @BarackObama and @repjohnlewis this weekend. An excellent way to spend #MLKDay .
@BarackObama You are the best politician the world has had to date. Absolute inspiration. Wonderful human being. Your talented, intelligent, charismatic and handsome. God bless you and your beautiful family.
I love @BarackObama .
Yes! Incredible! I thought @BarackObama would do an awesome job with his own talk show too!
@DNC @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @MSNBC @CNN
legend! @BarackObama
@BarackObama Can you help me get my rank up in @Rainbow6Game ?
Yeah he would be marching. Marching you and the rest of your posse right to jail where you belong. I also believe the man who shredded our constitution was @BarackObama . If you cared about our rights so much where were you on the #FISA702 ? #DoubleStandards #demdown
@MichelleObama and @BarackObama
@BarackObama I miss u.,Clinton & Bush. You were all so civil, & the entire world respected u even if they did not always agree.
Praise a man when it's convenient. How about you praise a man who has done great things for an already great country. You remember @BarackObama don't You?
y ese unfollow @BarackObama ??

There's no greater evidence that U.S. is fighting a civil war than first electing @BarackObama followed by electing @realDonaldTrump . #VOTE2018

@BarackObama help me meet Niall Horan this year thank u mr president
@BarackObama hmu
On @BarackObama 's first #MartinLutherKingDay as @POTUS44 (January 18, 2010), he spent the day honoring Dr. King's legacy by serving hot lunches and discussing racial equality at the White House and the Kennedy Center. On his first MLK Day, @realDonaldTrump played golf.
#MyNextGuest is outstanding and compelling television @NetflixUK @netflix @BarackObama Letterman raises the bar once again
I want to be great like @BarackObama and #MLKJr Watch my video #thegivingbowl #kindnessmatters #DayofService #blankies4mybuddies https:// youtu.be/zcrePy-5xxI @TheEllenShow @Oprah

Watching @Letterman 's Netflix special FT. @BarackObama On this #MLKDay and the realness of the whole interview is everything. #WorthYourTime #ComeBackBarack #Nostalgia
I agree, @BarackObama did a lot of damage and we are currently see its effects!!!
Why did @BarackObama put tens of thousands of children on top of trains and bring them here illegally? We all watched it!
I miss you @BarackObama . You inspired me everyday. #MLK
Wisdom has not been with Presidents since FDR, history will rank @BarackObama in that category!
Hi @BarackObama
@BarackObama you are going to prison
Hey @BarackObama did you want to take credit for N Korea and S Korea talking as well? You since you did leave this mess for the current @POTUS and never dealt with the sadistic and cruel dictator in #NK . Let us know when you stand in front of the @CNN camera's again soon - thanks
Today, my son & I watched @BarackObama & Kid President in this great video. Can we get a 3rd term? #MLKDay2018 https:// youtu.be/TssZ9Uma1-w
Can't blame Democrats for Republicans not being able to get things done! GOP has House Senate & POTUS, it's on all of you. Repubs shut down Gov before during @BarackObama 's tenure as POTUS. Those Dems r fighting 4 were brought here as young children & this is their home. #DACA
@BarackObama Hello Barack, my name is Samuel and it's a pleasure to greet you and I wanted to express my respect to your management as president of the United States and as an Argentine, I hope you will continue guiding us towards a path of equality and a lot of
