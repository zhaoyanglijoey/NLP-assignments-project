That was your guy Obama who brought that on. Let me help you. You can complain here: @BarackObama
Yeah we want that too.. So why don't you just step down. And let a real President lead the country.. Bring @BarackObama back.
@BarackObama well well bantam your the antichrist? You know, what would that make me? So what do you know about me that will help. SATAN? Who is only a Darker Superman.
@Oprah is the new @BarackObama .
Why does @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter and the rest of us have to gravel for the money for the wall when @BarackObama had no problem from Congress and MSM to give $150 billion to Iran mullahs ???? The wall needs to be fully funded no 10 yr pay out!

Just for the record I would never in a thousand years ever, ever have said that, or anything like that, about @BarackObama . His reputation is stellar, as well as @MichelleObama 's, so such a thought would never have entered my head. @realDonaldTrump ? He's a whole other story.

Hey @realDonaldTrump , I hope you know that removing TPS was the most disgusting thing you did to my people. You guys have military bases & make money from El Salvador . They were threatened by gangs & were allowed to come here because of @BarackObama and then you come and us.
..Yes, and all over the world , and without #Pizzagate / #pedogate @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @TheBushCenter
@BarackObama
We shall see but I won't hold my breath! I haven't seen much fight from the @Democrats so far! How about all the #filibusters the #republicans did during @BarackObama #presidency #DemExit happened for a reason!
How can a man praised by #WhiteSupremacists & calls #NeoNazis good people understand what he's doing? He called @BarackObama not American born and considers #PuertoRico a Foreign Country.
Have you lost your mind? If you thought @BarackObama had a liberal policies, wait till @Oprah outlines her agenda.
@Oprah 's speech at Golden Globes reminded me of @BarackObama

@BarackObama When you write your book, list all your accomplishments so the American people know what you did for this country. You have to toot your own horn especially in the face of all the obstruction you faced.
Oh, does @ChuckGrassley mean like how @SenateGOP made an effort in good faith when they gave Merrick Garland a confirmation hearing in the Senate when @BarackObama nominated him to the SCOTUS?

@RepAdamSchiff with @SenSanders , @GovHowardDean , or @JoeBiden would be the best DNC ticket. Or go with @HillaryClinton as VP. We need experience that has a clue about our military. @Oprah would be as bad as @BarackObama and #GeorgeWBush with DoD decisions.

Y'all know she'd give something away.. it'll cost most of us but somebody's gettin some free stuff.. @BarackObama gave away "free" cell phones.
What are @EricHolder & @BarackObama doing about this?? Have heard very little about their progress.
That is thanks to the last 8 years under @BarackObama
Someone get @brhodes , @JohnKerry & @BarackObama onto this
Actually, you're right. ANYONE should be able to be president. That's supposed to be part of the "American Dream," if you remember what that is. Where any child can dream to become president... based on qualifications, of course. Former SENATOR @BarackObama had plenty.

If we had to a get talkshow host, I wish it had been her. But now I do want someone whose passion and study has been the law and government their whole life. Basically another @BarackObama
After 8 years of @BarackObama and Dem rule? How is that possible? Should we arrest Obama or something?
Remember when @BarackObama said the US was founded by Muslims?
If @realDonaldTrump took the number of votes Hillary beat him by, added them to his followers, then doubled THAT number, he'd almost have as many followers as @BarackObama . Lol

Thank God we're still running on @BarackObama numbers. All you've done is a tax bill 2 weeks ago. First 18 months belongs to the previous guy. #FakePresident #Sad !
OMG @Oprah is all over MSM They're desperate to push her to run for President and oust @realDonaldTrump Just imagine! @BarackObama mark 2. Surely not, no! Please God no! :)
@BarackObama told America not to watch Fox-news, I watch all, keep friends close and my enemies closer @ABC @CBS @nbc @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews
I wish @MichelleObama would run for #POTUS in 2020. She's strong, dynamic, experienced, intelligent, and compassionate. She could unite the country. And she'd have @BarackObama as an advisor to fall back on. I want her to be the first woman President so much.
Glad that the "Cliven Bundy" ordeal is over. Shame that someone was murdered for nothing, but that's nothing new. Way to go @BarackObama
Graham claims the switch is cause 45 is his president so he should try to work with him. But @BarackObama was his president too & he did everything to avoid working with him for 8 yrs & Obama tried to work with @GOP constantly.

Why is the economy of South Africa's social media social slow? @BarackObama please help our country evolve to be more wiser and giving to the land because we struggle out here in the South. Haha. We struggling with communication skills.
Imagine if @BarackObama had said this while wearing a brown suit and having an arugula salad for lunch and fist bumping @MichelleObama afterward ... @seanhannity would have had 6 months of material. #hypocrites .
Thank you, @DrBiden and President @BarackObama . @College_Promise will become a reality after #BlueWave2018 .

It's way too late for him to do that, he can never inspire me unless he becomes like @BarackObama and what are the chances of that ever happening?

@BarackObama batter make sure my signature does not get out.
So, @RichLowry , it's contemptible to accuse @POTUS of dementia, but not contemptible to accuse @BarackObama of not being born in US? Got it. Sucks to have the shoe on the other foot, doesn't it?
It is so refreshing to finally see the worst president in US history @BarackObama get exposed for the who he really is. And that my friend is ANTI-AMERICAN.
@DylanMcDermott was miniature golfing on #FakeLaughSteve asking @IAmSteveHarvey one celebrity he would not want to meet again. #FakeLaughSteve said @realDonaldTrump while #FakeLaughSteve has benefited MORE and MADE MORE under @realDonaldTrump than @BarackObama Very #AntiAmerican

No doubt. That's a huge problem for them. But it doesn't mean @Oprah didn't give a good speech. @BarackObama 's political career took off with one good speech in a room full of liberals, right?

26,171 bombs dropped by @BarackObama did not deter anyone for supporting murder. On the other side of the coin seeing the DNC lose because of Oprah would put the DNC at rest. Still there's nothing like a good money hoarder for them.

@FBI are you going to stop @BarackObama from selling America out to enrich himself and other Democrat Politicians? Simple math & review of bank records demonstrate that they are making way more than We The People pay them. Who do they work for? Not Us!
What policies and procedures has @realDonaldTrump disrespected? I think you are confused, @BarackObama may go down as the most lawless President in history! This was the first election in history with a non peaceful transfer of power!

What #Trump has proven to us, although @POTUS is the highest office in our country, our country can govern itself without one. That said, we still need a President to inspire its people. #TakeBackAmerica @Oprah @MichelleObama #Oprah2020 @BarackObama @ABC @NBCNews @TheView
Oh you mean that @realDonaldTrump should be more like @BarackObama . It is a recipe for success!
@BarackObama PLEASE TELL @itsjoelpimentel TO FOLLOW ME :)
I understand where you're coming from. Many folks felt the same as you when @BarackObama was POTUS. All I was saying is that folks got to accept reality and make the best of it. Nobody should want the POTUS to fail. Lets get behind him an focus on winning.
Here's the thing #Oprah2020 is the American success story (much like @BarackObama ) POOR childhood, academically inclined, true business savvy, and charitable heart. She originated SO many giving fundraisers and gave generously of her own money.
I still do not understand how we went from an educated and confident @BarackObama to a mentally ill and insecure @realDonaldTrump
Did you respect @BarackObama ? If not, any attempt by you to tell others how to do ANYTHING is #PureGarbage . #TakeASeat #ShutYourTrap
Liar, liar pants on fire. President Trump DID NOT REVOKE "DACA." Why do you lie? Why didn't the DEMS do something when they had control of the HOUSE, SENATE AND WH? Instead, @BarackObama signs unconstitutional EO. Only Congress can legislate on immigration.
@BarackObama did it TWICE on his 1st try. He must be some like, SUPER GENIUS! Not like a dummy Donald regular genius pic.twitter.com/gd4yRygkoo
@oprah 's acceptance speech at the 'Golden Globe Awards' is easily the most compelling and powerful speech I have seen delivered closely followed by @BarackObama 's acceptance speech in 2008. She spoke on speaking your truth, displaying courage and pursuing your dreams. #BlackRocks

Well by my count @BillClinton @BarackObama @TheBushCenter all made it on their first runs. You ran in 2000. But your probable Demetria makes you forget that
*AND*, just to aggravate #45 just a *wee* bit more, President @BarackObama *never* testified under oath! (Surely, *that* should motivate Donald Trump to do something Obama didn't do! )

Lets pretend for a moment that, instead of bailing out banks and screwing over 5.2 million homeowners and their families, @BarackObama had actually bailed out American citizens, prosecuted those responsible for the crash, and broke up the banks. What a different world it would be

Great Job! Only 9.4 million more to go to beat @BarackObama !
That is what pragmatic politicians do. They don't get stuck in ideology and not move the country forward. I know it is hard to accept after 8 years of @BarackObama but that is what the left use to do also.
Mayday! Mayday! #Nashville is experiencing a state of emergency! @realDonaldTrump has landed at the @opry . Trump trucks are selling hats and t-shirts. Send TEMA! Send @FEMA ! For the love of GOD, send @BarackObama !!!! #helpus
If you could meet anyone who inspires you - who would they be? Mine: Oprah, Barak Obama, Maya Angelou, Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Mike Rowe and Elvis! @Oprah @BarackObama @DrMayaAngelou #MorganFreeman @mikeroweworks @AshleyJudd #Inspiration
Libya is in tatters, thanks to @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton .
@Oprah Would be a clone and a puppet of @BarackObama ! She is an awesome woman within the context of TV Entertainment. No for President! @FoxNews @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @nbc @NBCNews @CNN @ABC @CBS @nytimes @WSJ @POTUS
No way would I believe anything @BarackObama says especially when he supports terrorist organizations. Thank God he's out of the White house. I just wish he would go away and shut up!
