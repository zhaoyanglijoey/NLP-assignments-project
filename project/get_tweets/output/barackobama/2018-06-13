@GeorgeHWBush , @BillClinton , @JimmyCarter , @GeorgeWBush , @BarackObama you all really so petty & spiteful that you can't acknowledge #Trump 's historic meeting with Kim Jong Un? Your silence speaks volumes about the men you really are not. SMH pic.twitter.com/E6DxLXxnjJ
The Leftist Globalist Lunatics Like @BarackObama do not want NK and @realDonaldTrump to settle anything. Obama ignored NK for years. He wants to get lots money n reep from USA while secretly trying to destroy us. He's a Punk n Thug. Just ask @dennisrodman #MAGA
Mirror, Mirror on the wall who's the best.... @BarackObama
I got this From @BarackObama Legacy pic.twitter.com/lKJ51W0Vkf
One of the most moving tributes were the words @BarackObama said when honoring @TheEllenShow with the Medal of Freedom. He reminded us how courageous Ellen was when she came out. It was so early, risky, difficult. She cried. So did all of us who admire her.
@BarackObama BO don't know Texas. He, Valerie & Soros be better off in Chicago.
Thanks again to @BarackObama
don't rock the boat, keep @POTUS44 @BarackObama 's recovery going!
You're just realizing @BarackObama has no concept of humanity...?!?! pic.twitter.com/hBKq7AAd0u
It seems they make @BarackObama harder... because his administration placed little brown babies in cages & then in the hands of known human traffickers It's sad that you didn't care when you could have done something about this, actually it's disgusting pic.twitter.com/H5LB4uULkQ
Now that I see Trump appeasing a modern day Joesph Stalin, I am so sorry @BarackObama for condemning him over his very flawed foreign policy. But nothing is worse than how Trump is behaving on the world stage. I would take #obama anyday
Too bad the #Nobel became a #joke when they gave . @BarackObama the medal for nothing just after he was elected...
What is shameless is that @BarackObama was too busy making deals with Iran to give a crap about Otto.

Dear @BarackObama and @MichelleObama I would love to have you into my home for a fundraiser for @staceyabrams I believe she will be an amazing governor and want to do all I can to make that happen. I can promise good food and conversation :)
You can keep whining & crying until 2024, @potus is going nowhere until then. Poor little mistreated liberal snowflake, I know its hard for you to see all the winning when you were not used to it when @barackobama failed for 8 years straight......
He should decline it with class, and let them know that the honor lost its significance when @BarackObama got it for nothing.

I decided to move to the US @kylegriffin1 when I watched, in tears, on the eve of my 50th b'day, on the day @BarackObama was elected. SO PROUD I lived in times that made this possible. He and @MichelleObama remain the benchmarks in my life of humanity. SO proud of their influence
Thank God @potus saved America from @BarackObama . Elections have consequences- remember?
Um, because the media hates @realDonaldTrump , loves @BarackObama ?
@BarackObama Got One Because He Is A FRAUD.
#WeirdThingsIveGoogled Two things. "How much can @BarackObama bench press?" "How much can @MichelleObama bench press?"
. @BarackObama is a thoroughly petty human being.
@BarackObama the greatest POTUS to EVER serve America! Line up all POTUS & none of them compare especially with the piss poor economy Obama was left with. Thank you, Obama, for not folding during the many attacks against you hoping you would fail. Can you say gas prices? LOL
#TrumpSizesPeopleUp Look at this guy, I wish I had his charisma, looks, intelligence. He is loved by so many. Why was I born so damn dumb. My dad owned a brothel, is this why I have sexual harassment tendencies. I wish I was @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/lEOpFvVInZ

@BarackObama Wishing you were running for the presidency....you were 10 years too early. The madness has to stop. This has to be a bad dream
Thanks @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump has better relation with Rocket man than with his own @TheJusticeDept . Whats wrong with them? Please fire them all!!!!!!! Rosenstein needs to go now! @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton need to be indicted!!!

@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama when Obama went to Cuba the media and all the liberals were on the sidelines with their pompoms cheering.
@BarackObama So, any word on how Trump handled the NOKO? Or you sitting this one out?
How is @cafreeland "diplomat of the year"? Is it a participation award or is it an award based on results (of which we have seen none). This is like @BarackObama somehow winning a nobel peace prize.
@BarackObama @BarackObama Man, if you ran again for President, Trump would get smoked by 7,000,000 votes and by 400-135 electoral College win!!
Didn't Amy swear @BarackObama was bring down medical and drug costs with #ObummaCare ? And keep your doc? She can't be wrong 1,2,3,4 times now?

Hey quick question - Why was it not OK for @BarackObama to meet with NK, but it is great that trump does? @BarackObama is the better diplomat. Also, he isn't a fan of playing up to dictators. Why is this OK now, sean?

We ALL awaited with abated breath expecting and hoping that @BarackObama could help bring greatness, hope and peace to the United States with of allies and our enemies. In the end we all had to recognize that @BarackObama brought none of those things he promised.
Many Blacks are now saying the Plessy v Ferguson (separate but equal) wasn't such a bad idea. The problem was that it wasn't equal in action. This is no different from private schools in that it's all discriminant. @BarackObama did it as it pertains to vouchers and his children.
Lol damn liberal twit @maddow @MSNBC if it's not @BarackObama then bash. Trash.
@BarackObama Never said that and you know it.He ignored that loudmouth windbag because he knew wasn't a. He knew he could never get a middle or anything else past the ocean and their army besides marching is useless. Bush the idiot he figured that out,what does that say about you
. @barackobama needs to bring his patience, intelligence, and communication skills over here and explain to you how you are praising his good work and trying to claim it as your own. (You must be related to Trump and Sanders.) #STOPEMBARRASINGKENTUCKY #YouDoNotSpeakForUs
did you condemn it when @BarackObama was doing it? #stupidactors #hollyweird #entertainme
Per fox news, @BarackObama should not have met with NK. Why is ok if you do it? He is clearly a better diplomat.
When @BarackObama was our President, my in-laws and family from the UK happily came to visit us in Portland, Oregon aka #PDX . My Brit hubby was happy to visit his family in the UK. Right now, no one feels happy to visit the other so now we just Skype. *sigh*
I wrote you a letter while in office 4 times and you wrote back I really need to call in for an important favor @BarackObama
Hey, @ErinBurnett ? Did @BarackObama give too much when he got caught trying to sneak $1.7 BILLION DOLLARS to the mullahs in Iran? What did he get for that? Nothing.
Interesting since @RepCurbelo position immigration cliser to @BarackObama than @POTUS
The disasters @BarackObama left behind are his legacy.

Obama is setting up a shadow government to sabotage the Trump administration through a network of non-profits led by OFA, which is growing its war chest (more than $40 million) and has some 250 offices nationwide. @BarackObama
