If I say I think @BarackObama is a lying, piece of dung, will I get banned by @twitter ?
Trump is coasting on the @BarackObama economy -- trends he put into motion. We won't see the real effect of Trump's lunatic ideas about the economy (trade wars, tariffs) for another 1-2 years. Please do some reading on basic economics.
There is no rule saying @BarackObama can't run as a Vice-Presidential candidate. A smart play would be fer @SenBooker or @SenWarren to talk #BarackObama into being on their ticket. #POTUS #inners @maddow @chrislhayes

This is probably as perfect an audience for his biography as @RichCordray could ask for. Talking about taking on the big banks and predatory lenders. Definitely a lot of that on the East Side of Cleveland. Not to mention @BarackObama in tow shortly...
Agreed @DLoesch @NRATV . Even if the trains portrayed races, not about race. It's about #pimping #Kenya so @BarackObama & @MichelleObama can continue to brainwash toddlers & adolescents thru #children content. Nothing personal Kenya.

No, I don't think he's an illegal alien. President Barack Obama @BarackObama was not an illegal alien, he was born in Hawaii, and even if he was born over seas his mother was an American citizen, therefore he is either way.
This is why @BarackObama is still my president
We, as One Nation, one people of the Replublic will never bow down to #SWampers #DeepState and will WIN for the future a greater calling above the communist regimes @BarackObama intended to develop. Gen X will WIN no matter and @RepMaxineWaters @RepAdamSchiff will be FIRED!

Because she didnt want water. She was probably paid by @BarackObama to make Trump admin look bad. Plus she wants us to keep pouring in $$ for her and her cronies to skim off of.
Lifelong Rep, but when I lost 1/2 my net worth thanks to Bush economic policies I woke up and ran away, thanks to @BarackObama I recovered and then some, still riding his economy wave but cautiously hedging for the (hope I'm wrong) inevitable crash. #VoteBlue2018 #BlueWave2018
@BarackObama And the ring for when? #GHVIPGala1
@SusanSarandon @BarackObama Allowed the building of Chinese bases in the South China Sea & off the coast of Somalia at the entrance to the gulf of Aden Paying ransom to Iranian for hostages using foreign currency in unmarked plane Lying about paying ransom (which media ignored!)

Hell to the effing no. But @BarackObama and his flunkies encouraged this sick sense of entitlement. In EVERYONE. Definitely not okay nor the American way.
@SusanSarandon @BarackObama Lack of Confidence by NATO nations Signing a Disastrous Nuclear Deal w/ the Mullahs of Iran Paid $5 Billion & Released 5 Taliban Prisoners For Deserter Bergdahl Waging war by attacking Libya without Congressional approval
What if in 2020 @realDonaldTrump had his #DOJ #FBI & #CIA do what @BarackObama admin did 2 @DNC Presidential candidate would Democrats then be upset about spying & abuse of #FISACOURT or would they be ok with it like they are now? #DoubleStandards #ReleaseTheName #Declassify

I heard @BarackObama raped Catholic school boys inside a pentagram in the WH while gouging out their eyes, ripping off their limbs, and drinking the blood spurting from their necks. Or maybe he didn't.
And @BarackObama and the GD Democrats think this is good for America! Pardon me for not being politically correct, but adding these people and that culture to America is just an abomination! #MAGA @LANURSE1 @Education4Libs @dbongino @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @chuckwoolery
The fact is these numbers are a continuation of trends begun under @BarackObama .
@BarackObama is swamp slime. This is BO's payback 2 @POTUS for losing what he thought was a fantastic legacy. It was his pen & phone CON JOB. He's on a mission now to LIE about everything. #ObamasRevengeTour Now he can use his Rules For Radicals play book. pic.twitter.com/aUL4fy9UiT
Hola @BarackObama , por si te interesa #GHVIPGala1 pic.twitter.com/5jlwbAU5Ez
No. @BarackObama couldn't handle half the sh*t that @POTUS is thrown on a daily basis. Obama found it easier to lie and hide the important things, and our current President has no problem getting what's best for America. Trump is a real man.
@BarackObama check this out, fool. Oh, and white people feel the same way, "sit down and shut up, Obama"
@marcmaron just listened to your chat with @PaulMcCartney . If not for the chat with @BarackObama it would shoot to the number 1 position in my book. Thank you. It was absolutely wonderful.
@BarackObama Demand automobile tax big reduction, Turkey steeply raised its key interest rate in an attempt to stem the currency crisis, Mr. Geithner talked, the spider man who aims at the upper story of an apartment.
Most obvious? @BarackObama IMHO. Latest? @JohnKerry They can both choke on their dinner.
Did your favorite President @BarackObama increase the Deficit with the Un-Affordable Care Act?
Sorry, I must crucify @FBI @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @CNNPolitics @NBCNews @abcnews @CBSNews @RepAdamSchiff @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @RepMaxineWaters @KamalaHarris @jeffsessions @JohnBrennan @SenFeinstein So many and so little time.
Here is BS: @BarackObama said he considered joining the military but decided not to because the Vietnam War was over and "we weren't engaged in an active military conflict at that point."
There is no one like @BarackObama to twist or strangle the Truth or Facts! His disregard for the Constitution and tradition was made clear during his travesty of a presidency. He begged Dem voters to secure his legacy by voting for HER but WE had had #Enough . Barry needs to GO
Horrible, horrible dirty trick. How dare they refer information to the Justice dept. without publicly saying what it is. What could be worse? "An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama 's birth certificate is a fraud.

@SusanSarandon @BarackObama The Obama administration has been marred by debt, scandals, foreign policy failures, and an overall fragmentation of this country. He has plunged the United States into an abyss of economic debt that created generations of American servitude
Hi @BarackObama we love CHOCAGOUUWWW #GHVIPGala1 pic.twitter.com/314CIgW42E
@BarackObama please, vote for your lover. Don't worry about Michelle #GHVIPGala
While it is true that @BarackObama was afforded all the traditional courtesies afforded previous ex-prezzes by "W", It's also true that no former #POTUS has been so maligned and slandered by name by his successor. #Obama is right to call @realDonaldTrump out
@BarackObama So sad I will not be able to see you this trip to Ohio! Thank you for coming & I hope to catch you next time sir.
You mean Republicans want to grab credit for the @BarackObama economy. They don't want to talk about any other issue because in no other area does Trump get positive ratings.
@SusanSarandon BOTH OF U OLD WITCHES SHOULD SHUT THE FUCK UP & LEARN THE REAL FACTS OF WHO ALMOST DESTROYED OUR COUNTRY YOUR LAZY LYING IDIOT ARROGANT TELEPROMPTER READING CROOK @BarackObama ! Here's a List of Obama Failures that made America almost go down the toilet, read all:

If @realDonaldTrump was a bad president, @BarackObama would not need to campaign against him. It's costing us a fortune in Secret Service protection. #StayHomeBarack
3) not an indicator of confidence. The economy was recovering steadily under Pres @BarackObama ! We definitely felt more secure under Pres Obama. Talking this won't gain u anything. ppl r sick of #LiesLiesLies !
