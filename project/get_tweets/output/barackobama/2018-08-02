@BarackObama Such audacious and hopeful endorsements you bought and paid for pos.
Maybe you should report all the facts then and not what fits your worldview. For as bad as the right was with @BarackObama your network and particularly you & @ChrisCuomo are FAR worse to the right and @realDonaldTrump . If you don't want to be treated like an enemy stop being 1.
If the right wasn't so damn radicalised, they'd have seen they had an ally in the White House with self admitted moderate republican @BarackObama He definitely wants the Democratic party to stay centre right.
@BarackObama
Not a D student like @BarackObama
If Trump really inherited a solid @BarackObama economy @HillaryClinton would be @POTUS #MicDrop #TrumpTrain #MAGA
I wish @BarackObama really had tweeted this; it would get two million retweets, five million likes, and it would be the tweet of the year.
@BarackObama hated America and the citizens. @realDonaldTrump loves America and its citizens. It is perfectly clear now!

Long before our last legitimate, democratically-elected president, @POTUS44 @BarackObama , won in 2008, @SenateMajLdr B!tch McConnell blasted out a clear message that he would oppose anyone and anything president Obama would propose. Memories, like the corners of my mind.

@BarackObama Praise God for Trump and all the work he completed in two years.
I didn't read the piece yet, but I think the theory is to have voters love faith in the voting system and, as a result, create massive divisiveness. between ppl. They're not "tampering" with votes or machines. Just sowing discord. Kinda like what team @BarackObama did in Israel
you mean the left over success from @BarackObama ? Trump successful at lying cheatin
And @realDonaldTrump had an hour with the Queen ... Did anyone tell that Prez @BarackObama was given a proper state dinner & stayover?
YES they are resisting those things... The #AmericanCommunist @DNC has one clear objective.... To end America. @BarackObama put the wheels in motion. @realDonaldTrump stopped him and is reversing the damage he has done. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump college grades were As. Top of the class. @BarackObama college transcripts and admission applications are still sealed. #unsealObamaTranscripts . @TomFitton @seanhannity
Then explain why everyone was having to put merry x mas in stores or other public places. Because @BarackObama said it offends people who are not Christians. .... Just like now how we got 44 different genders instead of just 2 we have to stop saying mr or misses because offense

@ChrisCuomo you "sir" (not sure if you identify as male or female) are whats wrong with this country. And the company you work for @CNN has created the division in this country. Along with that idiot @BarackObama . He lied to this country for 8 years.
& won 30 of 50 states! - Apologies to @BarackObama who thinks there are 57 states. I guess he was thinking of the 57 Islamic states.
IS @senorrinhatch senile OR HUGE SNOWFLAKE hatch & @gop conveniently forget Pres @BarackObama was actually President (except when try to blame him for something) While Obama was Pres they worked hard to NULLIFY his presidency Remember birther trump SCOTUS Judge Garland etc
No doubt about it. Hey Russia, after my election, I have more flexibility. Fucking trader @BarackObama

because it wasn't progress, @BarackObama spent 8 yrs trying to destroy America & Israel, fortunately he only managed to destroy the radical @dnc & @HillaryClinton
Again a reminder: In the last 4 years of @BarackObama , an average of 213 K jobs/mo were added; in the 1st 16 mo of @realDonaldTrump , 189 K jobs/mo added. Under BO, S&P up average of 30.3/mo; under DT, that average is 20.5/mo.

you reporters and anchors have hurt your institution more than @realDonaldTrump or @PressSec could ever do in 1.5yrs. you all dove into bed with @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton instead of doing your job in a non biased fashion.
And how many times has the President, who is almost halfway thru his first term, visited troops in the AOR? At this point in his presidency, @BarackObama had already been to visit the troops twice, once each to Iraq and Afghanistan. It's called #Leadership . Look it up.
@BarackObama There are a lot of us, including in the DC area, who want to work for democracy here and abroad. Where is the most help needed?
It's black magic! @BarackObama best president of my lifetime.
@BarackObama The world misses you and your beautiful family.
I'm so upset trump is president. Lol my ex said, "You're obsessed" I said, "Disgusted. " Real tears. Again I miss @BarackObama
@BarackObama brought more jobs in
The great irony of your idiotic statement is that Trump was elected by white men in PA, MI and WI who voted twice for Barack @BarackObama . Maybe if you guys quit hating your own party members they'd start voting for your crappy candidates again.

Lol that's what 8 years of @BarackObama does to the mind.
@BarackObama I just want to say thank you. I will never get the chance to tell you in person, but this way at least I know I told you. Thank You for being a great world leader, husband, father and role model. Much of the world can learn from you if they so choose. Thank you!
He is an enlightened ethical human being. He glows. @BarackObama
Don't delude yourself. The US hasn't been admired since George Bush blew off the rest of the World's Good Will towards US after 9/11 and then we began these endless wars that even ran all through the @BarackObama "Do Nothing" except for Big Business administration.

Under Obama, we ALREADY had GDP growth of over 4% (even 5%), and unemployment dropped to the 4% area. We've had major growth thanks to President @BarackObama . Trump has only passed ONE major law.
This just in: @GOP politicians were so incredibly clever that they were able to craft a bill under @BarackObama , put his name on it, and pass it without a single Republican vote. Damn those crafty bastards! pic.twitter.com/n5DpEdkwyB
@BarackObama had 69%
That's why we have a 4%+ GDP after @BarackObama couldn't get over 3%. #WalkAway #ResistPolis
@BarackObama Obama is your fan and I saw your life story and you gave us Brazilians the way to do management and politics ..... Even though I do not know you, but your leadership activities motivate me. Hug. Ederson of the city of Caete MS- Brazil.
I just had an epiphany. @realDonaldTrump likes to do things opposite of what @BarackObama did and be the "best" or "first" of a President so we need to point out to him that President Obama never resigned. He could make a big deal out of it and have the best resignation ever.
5%? LOL. You must have dreamed that, sweetie. @BarackObama never got over 3%. That's why critics were telling Trump that getting 3% GDP was impossible and he proved them wrong. Obama's policies were killing the economy, not growing it. So many factories shut down, for instance.
Sounds like a bail out to me caused entirely by YOU. Oh wait 10 years ago when GM was being bailed out that was a cardinal sin because it was @BarackObama idea. GM did pay back all the money and more !! #FakePresident

Sooooo... Secret Service uncovered the latest spy during @BarackObama admin, but hid the scandal during #Trump admin - why? to avoid embarrassing him? (further?) That stinks. @SecretService should have more pride and stop trying to cover #TrumpTreason 's butt. @FBI @maddow
@BarackObama is that you?
