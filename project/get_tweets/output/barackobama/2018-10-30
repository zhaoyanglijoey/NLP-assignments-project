The stock market was skyrocketing before you took office, shithead. Thank @BarackObama for saving the economy, then move on.
I predict @BetoORourke will be President one day. He reminds me of the feeling I had when I first heard @BarackObama speak. How do you not vote for this inspiring man?! #BetoForSenate #Hardball #Vote

Go @BarackObama , get them "FIRED Up and ready to GO!!!"
Yeah thanks @BarackObama .....but you knew that would happen all along.
Not a single tweet from @BarackObama on the 5 Taliban released from GITMO who went on to join insurgents in Qatar. This is your legacy, Mr. former President, and I sincerely hope not one single American is injured/killed as a result of this. #WhatDidYouThinkWasGoingToHappen
@BarackObama good morning Sir ji
@BarackObama HMMMMM Doesn't sound or look like malnourished and weak individuals, looks like a bunch of third world criminals doing what they know how too. Bringing third world people, to a first class nation, will not make America Great! @POTUS use the PEN to stop the BRC! #MAGA

#HardBall I like what I hear of @BetoORourke . He reminds me of a young @BarackObama . Inclusion!!!!
@BarackObama you still peddling your hope and change bull crap?you failed for 8 years,give it s rest!patriots do not believe a word you say!!!!
Thanks, @BarackObama .
Yasssss my favorite and most intelligent @BarackObama and @BetoORourke went to my school Columbia University.
Words matter you might want to tell @realDonaldTrump that since he strokes the fuel for hate and racism. @BarackObama never did he brought the country together not try to divide us like your friend.
The tears that @BarackObama shed showed that he had more strength due to humanity and love for his country and the people that lived in it. He was a true leader!!!
Watching @hardball and @BetoORourke is bringing it like 2006 @BarackObama . Texas has the unique chance to not be the Alabama of the Southwest. #VoteBeto pic.twitter.com/SGesRn3ewR
I'll never understand why @BarackObama hated us and America.
I love @BetoORourke more & more everytime I hear him speak. I wish I lived in Texas just so I could vote for him. I definately see another @BarackObama in the making ! #Beto4Texas #BetoPlaysHardball #VoteBlue #Midterms2018
@BarackObama sitting in the hospital with my 70 y/o mom after she's had a stroke and a heart attack. We're watching news and they're talking about #45... she starts to cry. Why? Because she remembers and loves her favorite President... Barack Obama.
@GOP @POTUS #RedWave2018andBeyond I would never had voted for @DNC not fir free food, free housing and free @BarackObama cells. I am an American a Veteran and an nationalist. @Harlan @BreitbartNews @mitchellvii @michellemalkin @Jenn198523 #AmericaFirst for all Americans @BLEXIT
The market was on the rise when you took office. In fact, it grew more under President @BarackObama than it has with you. The reality of you and your incompetence is setting in is more plausible.
@BarackObama #ObamaLiedPeopleDied #ObamasLegacy
@BarackObama you should consider becoming a canadian citizen and running http:// barackobamaforpm.blogspot.ca /
Thanks @BarackObama
@Barackobama May 9, 1998
@BarackObama nice job shitbird
..and who's family, along with @BarackObama , desecrated the Rose Garden and everything this country is and stands for by 'honoring' his return...
What a surprise @BarackObama
@BarackObama why arent you stumping for @BetoORourke ? I still love you though.
Is there a single Republican that speaks and inspires like @BetoORourke or @BarackObama ? I don't mind a differing viewpoint, I would consider @SenJohnMcCain someone that made us happy to be Americans. Is there a single #Republican that lifts us up? #Resist #MAGA #America
How about @BarackObama Executive orders destroying our 2nd amendment and taking our guns away slow and stead?!
After the way @BarackObama and his admin treated #Israel I'm surprised that any #AMERICAN Jews could support @TheDemocrats and their #antiSemitic attitudes. #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever #BLEXIT #MXEXIT
Why not blame @HillaryClinton for not wanting to be civil, or @RepMaxineWaters for her mouth? Or @EricHolder or @BarackObama or @CoryBooker for being buddy buddy with @Farrakhan ? https:// youtu.be/c1g6oXRtXzY
@BarackObama Please check out my latest novel, The Burgeoning Heart of Bambi Bazooms. It's as fun as it is thought-provoking and inspiring, and I think you'll like it!

Not since Barack Obama @BarackObama have I felt so immediately connected to a politician as I do now to Beto O'Rourke @BetoORourke . I feel that if our great nation is to survive Traitor-Trump we need a person like @BetoORourke to become the president of the united states in 2020.
@BarackObama , even @tedcruz loves ACA feel like a dream @TheDemCoalition @TheDemocrats
Thanks @BarackObama @POTUS44 . Bang up job you did there.
I would bet 45 or someone in his admin. asked for TV coverage in the synagogue so he could turn it into a "rally". I can see him stomping his feet. "Unfair! @BarackObama got coverage in the church in CHS after shootings!" Difference: @BarackObama is a caring, compassionate man
Big blunder ahead @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @narendramodi I m going cashless
Dear Mr. President it has been brought to my attention that you and VP Biden can run again. Please come back reverse roles. We need u. #2212amend @BarackObama @JoeBiden @MichelleObama @JillBidenVeep #crisscross2020
@BarackObama change your site to EX-President, or @ExPresO
@BarackObama was never blamed? Are you high?
@BetoORourke is the greatest Democrat candidate since @BarackObama He will be POTUS in the very near future. @HardballChris #BetoForTexas #BetoForSenate
Yep! Thanks @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/hlAmHtbSHl
When I hear @BetoORourke speak, I see a mix of JFK and @BarackObama - charisma, passion, integrity. I hope he follows their footsteps to the White House. #BetoForSenate #BeAVoter
What hate speech has @BarackObama ever uttered. Tear up the, unenforceable, NDA and save your soul.
250k Veterans died waiting for treatment they never received under the government-run VA, under former president, @BarackObama . You can't even be trusted to treat 250k vets, yet you want us to trust you with millions of Americans? pic.twitter.com/Jm9Ry0zzt2
The only people surprised are the idiots that approved the deal. Well, on second thought @BarackObama , @JohnKerry and @JohnBrennan knew it from the start.
Thanks @BarackObama .
@BarackObama i miss you Mr. President
Maybe the issue is more an issue of the local officials. What would your response have been if it were @BarackObama ?
Well said @BarackObama !
Well since he's back in the public, let's ask @BarackObama about it
This will be my first time voting!!!! Every vote counts!!! VOTE.. p.s. I miss @BarackObama

Had @BarackObama said something similar regarding the 2nd Amendment, the right would have howled at the moon.
I'm starting to dislike this @BarackObama character. He's trouble.
You mean the events @BarackObama is paying people 15$ to show up at!! Bawahaaaa
@barackobama was a crook. His administration was loaded with corruption

Remember them @BarackObama
And which one of those was over turning a constitutional amendment? Remind me. I seem to recall that US oil production reached an all time high at the time under @BarackObama , and how does one stop "producing water"? And most military actions since WWII have been done that way.

Oh my God, listening to @BetoORourke on @hardball , reminds me of the pride I felt for our country when I listened to @BarackObama . These are men with conviction, passion and integrity.
OH. MY. WORD! I can't BELIEVE you guys!!!!! WWJD (What would John do?) And when he was running against @BarackObama you didn't respect him at all!!! Again you prove your inability to feel shame!
Funny he never reminded @BarackObama
Thanks @barackobama
Watching @BetoORourke with @ChrisMatthews on @HardballChris Wow. It's like watching Bobby Kennedy or @BarackObama . If Beto wins, he should run in 2020. Thought 2008 was too soon for Obama, but it was the right time. We need a POTUS with intelligence, heart, and moral clarity.
@BarackObama #LIMONADA

Watching @BetoORourke is like watching @BarackObama in 2004. I sat forward in my seat and KNEW Obama would be president one day. Beto gives me the same feeling.
Blame @BarackObama Obama for what? Being Black? Not like Dylan Roof was a card carrying, bumper sticker wearing Obama supporter?! Not like President Obama was an avowed nationalist. Nice stretch @nikkihaley #EpicFail #TheseApplesAintOranges

Does this qualify as a scandal orrrrrr what? @BarackObama
@BarackObama life long Democrat. Voted for you twice HRC once. The extremists on the left have flipped my moderate Dem vote red. Makes me sick seeing how the extremists have overtaken both parties. Best of luck Mr. President.
Those are @BarackObama 's boys. I know he's happy.
@nikkihaley I bet my next paycheck you did not watch @BarackObama eulogy of those victims? If you did you would keep your mouth shut. Trump is the Divider-in-Chief and nothing will change this fact.
Wow, he is shook up! @BarackObama "we don't even know where they are"? They're on the news everyday! Lol
Thanks, Barry! Thankful everyday that @BarackObama is no longer our president!
But @Acosta was fine when his hero @BarackObama issues Executive Orders violating the Constitution. Hannity > Acosta

@BarackObama Im so glad someone who mad 250k for a single speech can say that I, who makes a little over 30k a year doesn't need a tax break. Man, donate your millions and telling me what to do with my money.
@BarackObama This what PANIC looks like. We know the playbook well now..we used to believe the LIES--NO MORE. ACCUSE OTHERS OF WHAT YOU YOURSELF are doing or have done...ALINSKI TACTICS NO LONGER WORKING we knew all these events were coming it is what yall do TIMING???????????
I live in Dallas & I blame @BarackObama for all the race issues we are dealing with now. #BacktheBlue
@BarackObama out taking credit for a lot lately. I think this one is actually yours.
the way @BarackObama always divided us...
@BarackObama I wish you were still president. We all miss you. You were the first real president that I loved all three yrs. Please tell me @JoeBiden is going to run for 2020
@NancyPelosi @BarackObama @HillaryClinton
How the hell do you ppl still believe the Collusion Delusion? Hey Ed, write this one off! Although.... hiw about this~ Ask yourself, @POTUS can say @BarackObama wire tapped and the #FakeNewsMedia doesn't call him out! [BECAUSE ~ THEY CAN'T] research does a brain good! pic.twitter.com/XQhll2qlGH
I got you, @BarackObama !!! I miss you SO VERY MUCH. Please, come back....I NEED A PRESIDENT!
Exactly. Ppl do not read the entire 14A or understand it. But, let the SCOTUS decide. @BarackObama used EO to create DACA , unlawfully , but unopposed Enough! @axios you don't have well educated..bloggers!
I wonder if I go back through your tweets and see if you posted this when Barry, aka @BarackObama was making up stuff with his EOs?
@BarackObama You have ZERO power now...struggle to fill a gymnasium. ALL OUT FRAUD--people ar catching on rapidly WWG1WGA! The world is watching.
@BarackObama @realDonaldTrump . Patrots are in control. #MAGA
@BarackObama overthrew a sovereign government and invaded Libya through EXECUTIVE ACTION, implemented DACA through EXECUTIVE ORDER, Stopped US oil and water production WITH A STROKE OF A PEN. He was the King of presidential overreach. #Hypocrisy #ObamaAutocracy
Democrats should watch this and we all stop these ppl from coming into the US. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @WhiteHouse
@BarackObama , how precisely did you start the current economic boom we're experiencing that you're claiming to have left for @realDonaldTrump ?
Of course @realDonaldTrump looks forward to working with him. He's supposed to look forwarding to working with the leader of another country. At least he's not going to be like @BarackObama and been over and let America get screwed.
Democrats and @BarackObama tripled the DOW in spite of the birthers in the @GOP doing worse than nothing to help with what he inherited.
Last time that happened, as I recall, was when the @BarackObama administration tried telling Lutherans who they were allowed to ordain, and it was kind of joyful.
You are correct. This is not the America Millions of Americans knew before @BarackObama and the #Leftist crowd came to Power. I salute your heroism and skill as a pilot while deploring your narrow-mindedness as a human being. You are #Lindbergh pre-WW II.
Damn, look at those lies! That MFer in Afghanistan was sawing heads off and calling out @BarackObama
Come again with you response. We are in worst shape now than ever before. Funny how he is undoing all the positive things @BarackObama did. Just proves he was mad at his success. Was there ever a scandal during his term...... pic.twitter.com/pGJJomGNsb
President @BarackObama wasn't egging people on with conspiracy theories about African Americans or immigrants. @POTUS was and is and the killer killed these people to stop the Jews from helping immigrants. See the connection??? Not the same at all.
I sure would love to listen in on the phone call Trump has to make to Netanyahu about what the fuck happened in Pittsburgh. Not such a big shot now our president @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden @EricHolder He better seek a pardon from Israel
Really starting to worry about @BarackObama saw a recent speach and it looks like he is competley drug induced , slurred his word, looking crazy . Scary . #saynottodrugs
@BarackObama Now this is an Obama classic. Obama was critiquing one of Trumps strategies to make America Great Again, create jobs. Obama says the following in one of his speeches: He said he is going to create jobs. I asked how he was going to do this - no answer. Go to #6.
Not on path The recession is already upon us. It has started this will be the greatest recession America has ever encounterd. Many ppl will die.Inflation rates at all time high. This racist bigot #45 ran America into the ground.We need to make exception @BarackObama to save us
@Acosta - no one wants you to give @POTUS a free pass & fellatio sessions like you did @BarackObama , BUT when you and your comrades paint him as #Hitler , an ENEMY of the U.S. guess what?... YOU become the enemy! Got it? Be fair and honest and that will end. Viva @realDonaldTrump
