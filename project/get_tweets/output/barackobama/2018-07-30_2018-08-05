. @BarackObama and @joebiden made a surprise visit to @dogtagbakery in Georgetown on Monday. The latest story in our What Works Next series features millennial-run programs like Dog Tag Bakery that are serving veterans across the country. @Dogtagbakery https:// politi.co/2LMV81a pic.twitter.com/UN32dcai28
@BarackObama was never a friend of the military. I am blessed to have not had to serve under his regime.
Please come back!!!!! Please!!!! @BarackObama
Many people believe it's a cover up, because it's nonsense! Meddaling in elections- going on 4eva! Ask @BarackObama what he did to Israeli/Chinese elections? Waste of TAXPAYER'S dollars
Always, always... @BarackObama and @JoeBiden ALWAYS!!!
I literally thought, "Wow. She is beautiful." That's an amazing color on her. @MichelleObama @BarackObama
I miss you, @BarackObama !
I love how folks @jaketapper didn't want @BarackObama @JoeBiden when they had him and now want him to come to the rescue. Go troll that *%!$%* at Fox News. Life of a black man, Jake. Life of a black man.
I have a dream! Please look at the attached pic. Joining the party and promoting progressives #FBRparty . Please: 1 Like 2 Retweet or Reply 3 Follow I follow you back. @krassenstein @TalbertSwan @TheUSASingers @EdKrassen @BarackObama @morningmika @JoeNBC @TalbertSwan pic.twitter.com/ArRmbqDmYz

Anybody know where @CNN was when @BarackObama said the same thing? #WalkAway
Give the man a break @jaketapper .. Iike the man @BarackObama himself said.. His administration was scandal free ! pic.twitter.com/3g60rP4GEy
@BarackObama was the worst in the history of America. Don't cut him slack with any qualifying language.
@jaketapper Is it okay that @BarackObama and @JoeBiden ate lunch today together, or is that too superficial to report on?
Can @BarackObama run as VP in 2020?
The dons an odd chap but is @BarackObama still working on Guantanamo his 1st thing. It said he was 10 million better off after the game show @realDonaldTrump has his own rules to the game but we may have an end in sight Beam me up WW3 @jeremycorbyn 4UK
@JoeBiden @BarackObama
I really truly miss them, I think the whole world and most of all the country miss them both @JoeBiden @BarackObama
@JoeBiden @BarackObama
@jaketapper needs to pay closer attention to the news. @BarackObama is no longer @potus . If Jake wants to be the work ethic police he might want to have a chat with the guy who spends 5 days a week sending the country to hell and every weekend golfing.
@BarackObama @JoeBiden @nytimes Gentlemen, maybe you can answer this burning question that many have? At what point does a #patriot stand up and say enough of #TrumpTreason grab a fire arm & head down to DC to confront the #TRAITOR in the @WhiteHouse ? As our ancestors did?
InTheLandOfStupid is more like it. Their last day in office is fortunately in rearview mirror. @BarackObama used his @DOJ @FBI to surveil the opposition party using fascist police state tactics and u r either ok w that or dumb as a post. #WalkAway #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Really interesting chat about the @BarackObama Mandala lecture. Obama openly talks about what Chomsky has said for decades. Its pretty incredible. @RonPlacone @jimmy_dore @grahamelwood @miserablelib @HumanistReport @KyleKulinski https:// youtu.be/jH1mOgjUqxk

I miss President @BarackObama and Vice President @JoeBiden every single moment that trump is in The People's White House. From the best of the best to the absolute worst. Jesus take the wheel and drive us out of the mess we're in.
Great Move O' You Probably Picked Up Quite A Few Votes With That One! Thanks @BarackObama !
HONEST QUESTION: CAN @JoeBiden RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020 AND @BarackObama AS HIS VP??
@BarackObama I don't want my tax dollars supporting killers. Police departments.
We are thankful for our military and those who serve to protect our NATION (bc we have borders). We are thankful to our @POTUS and his administration for all they do to correct the wrongs imposed by @BarackObama 's regime and @HillaryClinton 's evil intent.
If we send "North Korea" 150 billion in unmarked dollars and Euros I'm sure they'll be our friends.. right @BarackObama ?
@BarackObama policemen are nothing but murderers/killers. Shooting their guns with innocent people around & unarmed black men. How do we Defund the POLICE DEPARTMENT?
Move to the US, we have plenty of great jobs. Healthcare is a little pricey since the @BarackObama presidency, but thanks to @realDonaldTrump we are no longer forced to have it. #Winning
Sigh, I miss seeing them everyday. @BarackObama @JoeBiden
The GOP appears to be the party in trouble but sure, lets blame @BarackObama
i have never missed a human being i have known in real life as much as i miss @BarackObama
I had a dream last night that thrilled me 2 my bones. { And it wasn't wet } I dreamed that N the November elections we took the Senate & the House away from the Republicans. And, in 2020 @JoeBiden ran 4 president, & @BarackObama was his vice-president. Trump was in Leavenworth.
This looks like a winning 2020 ticket. That's what I'm thinking, @JoeBiden @BarackObama
Did @BarackObama and @JoeBiden approve it?
@BarackObama YOUR PLAN TO DESTROY TRUMP IS BACK FIRING ON YOU AND YOUR ADMIN. IF ANYTHING, ALL YOU DID WAS GUARANTEE TRUMP ANOTHER 4 YEARS IN THE WH. THANKS FOR ALL YOU DID, AND FOR OPENING OUR EYES TO THE CRIMES OF THE DEM. PARTY. YOU ALL SUCK DICK!! pic.twitter.com/lNKhdus99h

This visit is pandering and sadly disingenuous and a #cheapphotoop probably made @BarackObama ill since he despises our military
You said it, @tammyrosescott ! I miss @BarackObama and @JoeBiden so much!!!
So? @BarackObama still gotta get his party on. Sorry @jaketapper pic.twitter.com/CKJmc0ydPr
Remember how horribly our last legitimate, democratically elected @POTUS44 @BarackObama was treated and criticized, because he was willing to meet with the Iranians without preset conditions? Suddenly, with @realDonaldTrump as our first non- @POTUS it seems ok. #TrumpGOPHypocrisy

2012:The difference between @MittRomney and @BarackObama 's campaign promises to @Israel is that Mitt will actually keep all of his.
Two awesome guys. Miss them. @BarackObama @JoeBiden
@BarackObama @JoeBiden I love these men! I wish they would come back! Please for all that remains good in America...Please (I'm on my knees) please come back!

I sure do miss those guys! To deal with the anger, disillusionment, and anguish about the current state of our federal government, I watch videos of @BarackObama . Perhaps this #November2018 American will reclaim some of its government. #VOTE as if our well-being depends on it.
So you people already planning on blaming Trump's crash on @BarackObama ?? Just wow!!
I agree @Trevornoah #AnneLowery the #Government needs to give everyone money for UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME. $500-1000 per yr = 3.9 trillion per GDP. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama just cut a low tax from state tax, carbon tax etc. @FoxNews @CNN @TheView Now that's news
My President and Vice President. We miss our last true leadership @BarackObama @JoeBiden

Such welcome images and news! Thanks @BarackObama and @VP44
The 4.1% is a small bump in what has been a steady linear rise in the GDP since @BarackObama turned the economy around in 2010. If you can hold on to that number for the next 3 quarters then maybe you have done something but I think next quarter is going to be well below 4%
Seeing @BarackObama & @JoeBiden , out together, smiling, relaxed. Made me so happy. Then it was gone, replaced by Trump's latest lie
@JoeBiden @BarackObama , come back! Please save us!

Also reminds me that for the LIFE of me 14 years after I first heard his name, I couldn't name one "personal lawyer" for @BarackObama . Ty Cobb and John Dowd should be clinking glasses of Macallan at Capital Grille every night and thanking their lucky stars that they're out.

@JoeBiden & @BarackObama need their own comedy special. Please #Netflix ... tanks
Usually, this is wat is done right? Both sides coming to the table either for diplomacy, to bring their list of demands, or strategically to size each other up. @BarackObama did it. I guess the real prob is @realDonaldTrump can't b trusted to do any of those correctly

@BarackObama Sir, you ARE sorely missed!!!!!!!!! Never imagined a single person, who is a self-proclaimed genius, could divide an entire country and put the United States on a collision course of failure and disaster.
I miss @BarackObama
A fan of 70's and 80's music, I finally figured out the music analogy for the @realDonaldTrump and @BarackObama cults. Trump is Molly Hatchett's Dave Hlubek (rough, crude and loud) - Obama is Lionel Ritchie (smooth, cool and soft). Two groups that you would never seen together.
@BarackObama I love waking up and finding out you are gone and Trump is president.

I'm no silly enough to believe that that much of the hate @BarackObama got was for being a black dude. Also, I never said all white folks are bigots. That's like saying all men are rapist. It's false. But #TrumpsAWhiteSupremacist
@BarackObama Mr President Thanks for everything.
@BarackObama . . . h e l p
Iran hasn't stopped either. @BarackObama could not be reached for comment.
@MichelleObama , I miss you and @BarackObama as our President and First Lady. Thank you for recognizing the good works @KingJames has begun. Hopefully, this is a seed for change and tolerance!
Dear @BarackObama , I don't hate you because your black, I don't hate you for being Muslim or Gay. I hate you because you are a lying #Socialist and the 1st Black POTUS who should have done better. But you followed in the shadow of all those Socialist White guys... You failed

Sixth in line for succession Secretary of Defense James Mattis @DeptofDefense #SecDef Mattis Is the only honorable man that I would choose to lead our great country. How can that be you ask ??? He was appointed by the last legitimate POTUS @BarackObama not #Trump #resist
Reminder! @BarackObama had 4 quarters with a higher GDP. That means currently the #IllegitimatePresident @realDonaldTrump is in 5th place. Which makes him a loser!
This speech by @BarackObama was so important! He told us what the consequences would be like if we don't vote. Everything he said was on the ballot how's now been destroyed by 45 pic.twitter.com/3GJLXamrbn
Love this, but @BarackObama and @MichelleObama where were you for the black community for the 8 years you were in the White House?
@paladine @ThePerezHilton @BarackObama @SecretService @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @FBI @princessfemme @SecretService reminds me of a song, Dirty White Boy
Really miss @BarackObama
No the national press will never cover anything that would put @BarackObama in a bad light which he has proved he is a liar & a fraud. Run his Social Security number through e-verify & you will find he was never qualified to hold any job in America.
Notwithstanding that Mandela overcame enormous obstacles and was a good man. The ex president @BarackObama cares more for other countries more than his own.
This last weekend, I went to see my Trump-supporting brother. He used to lecture me about @BarackObama . Trump didn't come up once the whole weekend. Guess my brother got bored and changed channels. One can only hope this is a trend that spreads. #BlueWave2018

@HillaryClinton @BarackObama But Hillary lied and Americans died And the selling uranium to Russia Should put both of you in front of a firing squad... Let's see you jailed a kid for taking a picture remember Someone need to unseal Obama's Records.
5 minutes of @realDonaldTrump 's actual work is worth all of @BarackObama 's flowery marxist words.
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton @Comey I can't figure out which one of you sorry SOB's is the biggest Liar! We know who told the most
Funny how easily you forget the 9th Circuit Appeals Court ruled it constitutional in 1994. You also ignore the fact that @BarackObama exploited that law.

Vlad I can can be more flexible now. @BarackObama is grandstanding.
Companies like Amazon that are comitting fraud and gouging customers (see definition of Comcast, Verizon, big telecom) do more damage to our country than Russia ever will by normalizing bad faith. This is why it's not cool to see @BarackObama taking money from banks. #fraud
. @BarackObama and I are so proud of @KingJames and @IPROMISESchool . Kids in Akron and across the US are lucky to have you as a role model on and off the court. Keep using your platform for good and giving our kids a chance to shoot for the stars. #ReachHigher #BetterMakeRoom
Yes, and @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton are so proud of this achievement.
If he keeps the job until 2020 that would mean @realDonaldTrump had 2 less Chiefs than @BarackObama during his first term.
I remember when Stephen Colbert wasn't @HillaryClinton 's and @BarackObama 's cock holster. I remember when @StephenAtHome was actually LMAO funny. #Sad waste of talent.
Now let's arrest and prosecute the MFs who provided him the weapons @EricHolder and @BarackObama #fastandfurious

Eric Holder should be on trial with him, oh, and @BarackObama

Is that what @BarackObama did? "Race neutral neutral" messaging as a black man. How did that work for the Dems in general (massive dem losses in multiple state houses)?

Remember, Garry, @BarackObama did the same stupid thing - We even have footage of HIS cabinet members touring these same facilities in 2010-2012! If it was OK when Obama did it, why is it WRONG now that @POTUS is doing it? Or, will you break with the DNC & condemn Obama for this?

@BarackObama Word has it that you've got a campaign. What is it?
I have missed @BarackObama and @MichelleObama too. Very much. But, anyone who faulted their need to take a break, enjoy life and each other after that 8 years, just needed to take a breath. We knew they'd show up. And @JoeBiden also.
BECAUSE it was @BarackObama AND he hid lots from the American people..you know that TRANSPARENT Presidency he spoke about. Was a bunch of BS.
Dear Mr President @BarackObama - you missed one very important candidate @WilliamsForMT !
@BarackObama Barack is back! #hardball pic.twitter.com/qZPt6oOwUn
That Is Excellent, Mr. President. @BarackObama spent $10 Trillion in debt buildup to grow government & dump billions to prop up Wall Street & maintain what he called a 'jobless recovery'. He & leftwing globalists then spent money advertising the virtues of unemployment! #NoShame
Include @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama in your report too
As a happily married woman I don't know who I am more in love with: @KingJames or @BarackObama . These men represent the best in America and the basic decency that has represented the greatness of America before @realDonaldTrump brought forth his hate, his lying, his treason.
Who cares what @BarackObama endorses. This is what America wants to see Vice President Pence Delivers Remarks at an Honorable Carry Ceremony https:// youtu.be/3PBlPticJPM

@BarackObama congratulates @KingJames for opening a new FREE school while @POTUS twitters out insults. BHO & LJ are MAGA. Not trump. SAD.
@washingtonpost can you tell me how many times @BarackObama has lied since he was in office. Rick Santorum said he told lies, whoppers is what he said.

Did @BarackObama get this kind of recognition every time growth was over 4%? Deficit is growing, wages are stagnant, inflation is climbing, layoffs are being announced, and the rich are getting richer. #GOPTaxScam #CA23
Because there was no way to confirm the child belonged to the adult they arrived with, or the parent had a violent criminal record. @BarackObama released children to traffickers
She's not though, right?! @Ocasio2018 Upper middle class; father's architect (or lawyer). Another phony like @BarackObama hiding her past!

go and take your little wonder wand @BarackObama and disappear into the woods with crooked Hilary & then you may give the Dems some chance of reforming themselves. the @realDonaldTrump is kicking ass on the economy & trade & improving the lives of millions!
i wish @BarackObama would run in 2020. he'd get my vote! he's, as they say, tanned (heh), rested, and ready! i suppose michelle would shit a kitten but hey, the country needs strong honest brilliant humane inspiring leadership again.
@BarackObama needs to do more in 2018. Asleep at the switch in the 2010 elections is part of what got us here. And I love the guy...

@BarackObama Happened upon BET and the last musical performance with you and Michelle in the White House. You said "it will be alright" after you left. Sadly, it's not. You are still my President. I refuse to accept the horror of this time in history. But, we shall overcome.
Mankind's ability to watch this and ignore it because it's not happening to them is distressing. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @NATO @UN if only we cared again. #Syria #bbcnews

Thank @BarackObama that I'm still covered by my mom's health insurance, because my poor 24-year-old body requires multiple doctors at the moment.
Yep, @Ocasio2018 is spoiled girl wanting to be "bad" just like @BarackObama : "if they bring knife to fight, we bring gun." classy!
You remain an inspiration @BarackObama . Thank you very much. I look forward to seeing you face to face very soon. I love you.
A little bit frustrated tonight but it's the past... @BarackObama a friend showed me letters you replied back to her.... U never once answered my letters
I also remember democrats protecting @BarackObama when he drew a red line in Syrian that ended up killing 10000 innocent people, 3000 of them children. The democrats were silent on that and put their collective heads in the sand!
@BarackObama why are you not supporting Gov Tom Wolf, Scott Wallace in PA 1, and, Helen Tai in Pa Assembly 178.
@BarackObama read your endorsement list. You missed two women, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY) and Jamie McLeod Skinner (OR CD 2). Jamie is planning on defeating horrible Greg Walden. Please endorse! Turn Oregon BLUE! Thank you!
Congrats to @AftabPureval on your big endorsement from @BarackObama ! Oh1 is part of the #bluewave !

Not that it matters a damn but what does @BarackObama think. If roles were reversed he'd be outraged. @realDonaldTrump should send peace keepers then count to 10 and then send troops!
@BarackObama you and Bill Clinton are the only last Presidents that don't want to give it up. Your 15 minutes of fame are over. And lease keep up the candidate endorsements. Now I know they do lose
Damn I was hoping @BarackObama would lose his passport in Somalia and be banned from traveling to the USA
@BarackObama We miss you Brother. Peace and Love to you and your family.
Be assured, @realdonaldtrump & his MASTER @PutinRF_Eng , have NEVER faced the consequences of attacking American Patriots. They now will. If they had any sense, they'd ponder #Gettysburg & the #NormandyBeaches & #IwoJima before proceeding. cc @FBI @BarackObama @EricHolder

@BarackObama & @MichelleObama , please consider also endorsing Audrey Denny ( @audrey4congress ) in CA-1 who is running against Doug LaMalfa.We must unseat LaMalfa who votes to impose stricter restrictions on SNAP & other assistance for the poor while he gladly takes farm subsidies.
I can't believe I found out a former law school classmate is running for NC State House by seeing her endorsement from @BarackObama . GO, SYDNEY BATCH!

@BarackObama has always been Hindu phobic . We are glad that @realDonaldTrump was voted in
O.k. o.k. but please, let this happen. Let's just squash the entire @BarackObama legacy. I hope @JoeBiden runs, trips, and falls on his hair-plugged face. #MAGA #TrumpVJoe2020 https:// politi.co/2n04qsv

Please @BarackObama I know you'd rather not, but this democracy really needs your support at a moment like this. We miss you and your family so much!
Did @BarackObama endorse @BetoORourke ??? Seems like a no-brainer.
Okay frauds, why now? Why not during @BarackObama administration? You clowns are fooling nobody.
Ay, @BarackObama ...did you ever need an attorney during your presidency? Just asking for America.
@BarackObama Yow my President we need the senate too have a great day WE love you
@BarackObama This is what a TRUE PRESIDENT does.. RESPECT GOD NOT CONDEMN HIM!!! But your party wouldn't know what Christianity is but more over you "unleash" your far left loud mouths like @RepMaxineWaters who can't shut her mouth up. We're about fairness but she blasts us.
@BarackObama I'm sorry Mr. President, but I can't let this go. Why aren't you supporting @BetoORourke ?
@BarackObama @MichelleObama I miss you. #RelationshipGoals
@BarackObama @JoeBiden I think you guys should keep showing up at random places in DC, it was great seeing you

@BarackObama Such audacious and hopeful endorsements you bought and paid for pos.
Maybe you should report all the facts then and not what fits your worldview. For as bad as the right was with @BarackObama your network and particularly you & @ChrisCuomo are FAR worse to the right and @realDonaldTrump . If you don't want to be treated like an enemy stop being 1.
If the right wasn't so damn radicalised, they'd have seen they had an ally in the White House with self admitted moderate republican @BarackObama He definitely wants the Democratic party to stay centre right.

If Trump really inherited a solid @BarackObama economy @HillaryClinton would be @POTUS #MicDrop #TrumpTrain #MAGA
I wish @BarackObama really had tweeted this; it would get two million retweets, five million likes, and it would be the tweet of the year.
@BarackObama hated America and the citizens. @realDonaldTrump loves America and its citizens. It is perfectly clear now!

Long before our last legitimate, democratically-elected president, @POTUS44 @BarackObama , won in 2008, @SenateMajLdr B!tch McConnell blasted out a clear message that he would oppose anyone and anything president Obama would propose. Memories, like the corners of my mind.

@BarackObama Praise God for Trump and all the work he completed in two years.
I didn't read the piece yet, but I think the theory is to have voters love faith in the voting system and, as a result, create massive divisiveness. between ppl. They're not "tampering" with votes or machines. Just sowing discord. Kinda like what team @BarackObama did in Israel
you mean the left over success from @BarackObama ? Trump successful at lying cheatin
And @realDonaldTrump had an hour with the Queen ... Did anyone tell that Prez @BarackObama was given a proper state dinner & stayover?
YES they are resisting those things... The #AmericanCommunist @DNC has one clear objective.... To end America. @BarackObama put the wheels in motion. @realDonaldTrump stopped him and is reversing the damage he has done. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump college grades were As. Top of the class. @BarackObama college transcripts and admission applications are still sealed. #unsealObamaTranscripts . @TomFitton @seanhannity
Then explain why everyone was having to put merry x mas in stores or other public places. Because @BarackObama said it offends people who are not Christians. .... Just like now how we got 44 different genders instead of just 2 we have to stop saying mr or misses because offense
@NewRiverNPS Raiders of the Lost Ark Indiana Jones " It's not the years , it's the mileage " . We should all respect Mother Earth. @BarackObama @FoxNews @BBCWorld
@ChrisCuomo you "sir" (not sure if you identify as male or female) are whats wrong with this country. And the company you work for @CNN has created the division in this country. Along with that idiot @BarackObama . He lied to this country for 8 years.
& won 30 of 50 states! - Apologies to @BarackObama who thinks there are 57 states. I guess he was thinking of the 57 Islamic states.
IS @senorrinhatch senile OR HUGE SNOWFLAKE hatch & @gop conveniently forget Pres @BarackObama was actually President (except when try to blame him for something) While Obama was Pres they worked hard to NULLIFY his presidency Remember birther trump SCOTUS Judge Garland etc
No doubt about it. Hey Russia, after my election, I have more flexibility. Fucking trader @BarackObama

Funny how GOP supporters can't sustain a debate without mentioning @BarackObama or @HillaryClinton whataboutism.
because it wasn't progress, @BarackObama spent 8 yrs trying to destroy America & Israel, fortunately he only managed to destroy the radical @dnc & @HillaryClinton
Again a reminder: In the last 4 years of @BarackObama , an average of 213 K jobs/mo were added; in the 1st 16 mo of @realDonaldTrump , 189 K jobs/mo added. Under BO, S&P up average of 30.3/mo; under DT, that average is 20.5/mo.

This is without any question fake news. NRA is actually quite the opposite and not at all hurting. Your movement and @BarackObama caused huge numbers to join the NRA. TELL THE TRUTH little man.

you reporters and anchors have hurt your institution more than @realDonaldTrump or @PressSec could ever do in 1.5yrs. you all dove into bed with @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton instead of doing your job in a non biased fashion.
And how many times has the President, who is almost halfway thru his first term, visited troops in the AOR? At this point in his presidency, @BarackObama had already been to visit the troops twice, once each to Iraq and Afghanistan. It's called #Leadership . Look it up.
@BarackObama There are a lot of us, including in the DC area, who want to work for democracy here and abroad. Where is the most help needed?
It's black magic! @BarackObama best president of my lifetime.
@BarackObama The world misses you and your beautiful family.
I'm so upset trump is president. Lol my ex said, "You're obsessed" I said, "Disgusted. " Real tears. Again I miss @BarackObama
@BarackObama brought more jobs in
The great irony of your idiotic statement is that Trump was elected by white men in PA, MI and WI who voted twice for Barack @BarackObama . Maybe if you guys quit hating your own party members they'd start voting for your crappy candidates again.

Lol that's what 8 years of @BarackObama does to the mind.
@BarackObama I just want to say thank you. I will never get the chance to tell you in person, but this way at least I know I told you. Thank You for being a great world leader, husband, father and role model. Much of the world can learn from you if they so choose. Thank you!
He is an enlightened ethical human being. He glows. @BarackObama
Don't delude yourself. The US hasn't been admired since George Bush blew off the rest of the World's Good Will towards US after 9/11 and then we began these endless wars that even ran all through the @BarackObama "Do Nothing" except for Big Business administration.

Under Obama, we ALREADY had GDP growth of over 4% (even 5%), and unemployment dropped to the 4% area. We've had major growth thanks to President @BarackObama . Trump has only passed ONE major law.
This just in: @GOP politicians were so incredibly clever that they were able to craft a bill under @BarackObama , put his name on it, and pass it without a single Republican vote. Damn those crafty bastards! pic.twitter.com/n5DpEdkwyB
@BarackObama had 69%
That's why we have a 4%+ GDP after @BarackObama couldn't get over 3%. #WalkAway #ResistPolis
@BarackObama Obama is your fan and I saw your life story and you gave us Brazilians the way to do management and politics ..... Even though I do not know you, but your leadership activities motivate me. Hug. Ederson of the city of Caete MS- Brazil.
I just had an epiphany. @realDonaldTrump likes to do things opposite of what @BarackObama did and be the "best" or "first" of a President so we need to point out to him that President Obama never resigned. He could make a big deal out of it and have the best resignation ever.
5%? LOL. You must have dreamed that, sweetie. @BarackObama never got over 3%. That's why critics were telling Trump that getting 3% GDP was impossible and he proved them wrong. Obama's policies were killing the economy, not growing it. So many factories shut down, for instance.
Sounds like a bail out to me caused entirely by YOU. Oh wait 10 years ago when GM was being bailed out that was a cardinal sin because it was @BarackObama idea. GM did pay back all the money and more !! #FakePresident

Sooooo... Secret Service uncovered the latest spy during @BarackObama admin, but hid the scandal during #Trump admin - why? to avoid embarrassing him? (further?) That stinks. @SecretService should have more pride and stop trying to cover #TrumpTreason 's butt. @FBI @maddow
@BarackObama is that you?

It's great to have a pro-science, pro-technology, and pro-space President @realDonaldTrump in office again. Under @BarackObama our astronauts had to pay billions to hitch rides into space with the Russians while Obama cut funding for #NASA and purposely held the US back. #Hannity
The last Black (?) U.S. Senator Democrats had was @BarackObama and given his body of work, there are numerous questions whether he was a Senator at all.
THANKS @BarackObama !
Thank you @BarackObama for the economy doing well!!
I WISH EXTREMELY EXTREMELY HAPPY,HAPPY,POWERFUL,PRESTIGIOUS AND POWERFUL AND SO HAPPY,POWERFUL #RUSSIAN ,FRANCE, #GERMAN ,ISRAEL AND #NEPAL ,JAPAN, #AUSTRALIAN ,CHINA AND #BRITAIN ' HAPPY,POWERFUL BIRTH DAY TO YOU THE HON 44TH PRESIDENT SHRI @BarackObama SIR OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
. @BarackObama faced a lot of racism as the 1st nonwhite @POTUS & was hated by racist whites just for defending Blacks & other minority groups. @RealCandaceO is a race traitor, not an activist for the Black community. She insults most Blacks for being Dems. She can go to Hell.
The judge rules for DACA proving he's the friend of illegals and the #EnemyOfTheState #EnemyOfThePeople and basically an @BarackObama A-Hole making unconstitutional law. #KavanaughSCOTUS can't get in soon enough.

Have a working vacation. At this time in @BarackObama presidency. How many days did he take off?
@BarackObama separated and deported families and @cnn remained silent. Remember the laws that are in place are the work of @NancyPelosi , @SenHarryReid , @chuckschumer @SenSanders and their hypocritical band of @dnc buddies. Furthermore, lets not forget about @gop involvement.
Maybe and thx @BarackObama
@BarackObama 's voice is music to my ears! I Love him!

to start a war for $, 43 went on a world-wide lie campaign & got criticized. to start multiple wars for $, @BarackObama told us he is always right & anyone who criticized him got branded/investigated. Ex @DrJillStein Tulsi Gabbard who is more dangerous 43 or 44?
Not when the US had a legitimate leader, like @BarackObama .

It is rude for this kind of statement to have come from a President of a country. I miss @BarackObama

If our current @POTUS took the approach of courts and just ignored the judgments and the law we would have @BarackObama and his appointees. This is the result. No respect for our constitution and the rule of law.

. @morningmika Donald Trump isn't "deteriorating". When @BarackObama said "the Oval Office doesn't change you, it's amplifies who you are", THAT'S what your seeing. Try Lincoln: "if you want to test the character of a man, give him power." It's NOT deterioration. It's who he is.
Sorry. it seemed that millions of Conservatives & Republicans throughout the nation didn't have a problem judging @BarackObama 's heart & faith - though he went to Church, spoke about his faith, & had works that reflected his faith. Trump doesn't do any of that.
Good morning from @BarackObama 's ancestral land
Happy birthday @BarackObama
Thank you @BarackObama for helping our country reach this point of an improved economy which @realDonaldTrump is doing his dambdest to destroy
When @BarackObama Was 1st elected President, He Met with All the Top Heads Of The Media..Except Fox News, Behind Closed Doors (This Was Before @realDonaldTrump Announced His Run)..anyways, From That Day On WE HAD #FakeNews .. So The Media Owns this..NOT Trump and Admin

Domestic policy takes 18-24 months to filter through to jobs so thanks @BarackObama
DACA wil be thrown out just like every other time a left leaning judge tries to legislate from the bench; ie Travel ban, forced union dues, and so on. Had @BarackObama run it through Congress and made it law. it would be different, but @realDonaldTrump can dump any EO's
Thank you @BarackObama !
YES!!! @BarackObama did you see this??? YEA!!!
Happy birthday @BarackObama . For the best President Ever

This Judge needs to be removed from the bench....... DACA was not approved through legislative branch, nor appropriated.... @BarackObama sure knew how to use his pen & phone....... @Potus @realdonaldtrump Mr. President, let's get this fixed.......
Where was @CNN when children were caged under @BarackObama ?
I'd like to see a journalist compare day by day the presidential term agendas/accomplishments of President @BarackObama and President @realDonaldTrump . Any takers? Please! It would be so useful to understand the changing presidency. #Media #FreePress #FriendOfThePeople
Where was this can-do attitude when @BarackObama was reviving the economy after '09? The recovery was, by all measures, remarkable, but if you listen to "conservatives" Obama was the worst potus ever.

Thanks @BarackObama for 90 straight months of declining unemployment! You really set this country on the path it needed to be! Sad that those numbers are now declining under tRUmp! Also sad that tRUmp sheep have been gaslighted and lied to thinking he did this! Obama did this!
I blame @BarackObama

@MeetThePress @chucktodd #MTPDaily Be friggin honest, in 2010, big Ed Schultz was on @MSNBC every single night, telling #Dems to stay home and "teach @BarackObama a lesson..." That really worked out for us, didn't it...
With the Democratic party opening abortion clinics in all the low income communities, they are contributing to the low number of black citizens. But hey, blame white people! I didn't see @BarackObama rescue your community!
Kept the peace killed Osama i was in AIT when that happened shit was EPIC! And provided universal health care witch isnt perfect but its there! @BarackObama is the GOAT GOD BLESS AMERICA I WAS OBAMAS SOLDIER!

@realDonaldTrump is more loyal to America than @BarackObama ever was and @HillaryClinton is a traitor to our country who tried to rig the election. They are the criminals. Quit drinking the Kool-Aid. You need to #WalkAway and educate yourself. Not believe what they tell you too.
I agree 100%. @BarackObama took a racial divide that was narrowimg, amplified it, and then exploited it for political gain with no concern for the damage it would cause to the nation and its communities. There are convicted war criminals that were less malevolent.

@ccn commentators are either idiots or intentionally attempting to deceive the public. Russian interference has been going on long before Trump (so lagitamcy of @BarackObama election sh be in question too). @potus is challenging allegation that he colluded with Russia to win.

@BarackObama "Master Manipulator" was the worst President ever to hold office of President. He along w/ "The Great Manipulator" (Iran) ran the "Dark Agenda," a sinister plot the keep everyone in the dark while sowed seeds of destruction and lined their pockets with Americans $$$.
@BarackObama , We demand the truth to be exposed, you are an illegal alien who became a US President, WE WANT JUSTICE!!!! pic.twitter.com/ocD5mZ17XH
Truly a hot mess. They need tougher policies and a police force backed by a real Mayor @ChicagosMayor is another spineless leftover created by @BarackObama and needs to move on. Just like other liberals he only cares for his on personal interests and gains. #firerahm
Um... @BarackObama cares.
I had my dream job, I was a flight attendant flying our military around the world. @BarackObama started pulling our troops, not only did I lose my job but ISIS got larger and started taking over. @realDonaldTrump definitely inherited a SWAMP

Started reading last night @brhodes memoir of his time working for @BarackObama . Inspirational stuff. And a tragic reminder of how far the White House has fallen...
Sir I don't mean any disrespect but you are #Brainwashed by the #continuous #Bombardment of #Lies from #CadetBoneSpurs AKA trump. When it was confirmed that #Russia #Interfered & #meddled in the #2016Election @BarackObama #Expelled Russian #Diplomats & imposed sanctions on Russia
We are making America great again, ourselves. Great observation. One day at a time it gets better, liberal tears are cleansing the land of @BarackObama stank.
Happy Birthday 2uuuu @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/UuhnIIscio
"Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek." - @BarackObama #MondayMotivation
Wash your mouth before you mention our awesome Real President @BarackObama you can not compare awesomeness with shit.
Trump rating (per @FiveThirtyEight ): Approve: 41.4% Quinnipiac Poll Trump's Approval 38% Gallup Poll Trump's Approval 41% You're delusional, sad and pathetic clinging onto @BarackObama when you don't compare to the Man or his legend who won the hearts of the people of America
@BarackObama Happy Birthday Mr. President! We miss you!
Do you know what you're talking about? Are you okay? You seem even more unhinged than usual lately. Did you remember to wish @BarackObama happy birthday yesterday. Go take a nap now.
Happy birthday to a great President! @BarackObama
This is a joke but funny as hell! @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/RkwLABnB9U

Freedom from @BarackObama ? Amen !!!!
I feel the same level of nostalgia for this group as I do when I see photos of @BarackObama
Happy Birthday to a wonderful, classy, intelligent man; President Barack Obama! We miss to so badly! @BarackObama
@BarackObama showed his Racist side here with no coverage at all. Why would white journalists support this?
We are all getting better at misinformation. It's war. It's obama's civil war in USA. Obama loses. Obama's Moors will not rule in USA or EU. @LouisFarrakhan @POTUS @VP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @BarackObama @OfficialCBC @GOP @TheDemocrats
Every damn day! Come back @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/bE2cESJK4P
At least circus peanuts are somewhat useful, unlike tRump and the cult 45 koolaid drinkers. Oh, by the way, happy belated birthday @BarackObama .

President @POTUS44 had to repair the cratered economy caused by his predecessor. You inherited the results of @BarackObama 's hard work over 8 years.
How can you asked to be trusted?once @cnn was news today u r fake news ie. @BarackObama took the missiles from Poland today the have back. Today Ucrania have offensive weapons. @DNC gave$150 billions to Iran what are you but fake

Happy #ObamaDay thanks for making Chicago great again ! @BarackObama
@BarackObama Happy late Birthday #keepshining
POTUS. I know, it's an anachronym and not a "real" word but that's my word for President @BarackObama . He's the last sitting POTUS our nation has had.
The men and women ignored - and mocked, frankly - by @barackobama are finally making headway - under a @realdonaldtrump economy! "Workers Hardest Hit by Recession Are Joining in Recovery" @nytimes https:// nyti.ms/2O8JoDO
Your "accomplishments" are @BarackObama 's. You're literally taking credit for Obama saving the economy that another Republican tanked. WE WILL NOT FORGET! Unemployment has trended downward and the economy upward since Obama took office. GET FUCKED, #45!
Yes...and almonds to sprinkle on top too. #blameobama as he got your coconut and almonds. @BarackObama Please send some of your cake to Jason. Thank you.
In honor of Barack's tan suit fashion moment and birthday yesterday, I watched Memento ( @BarackObama you wore it better) pic.twitter.com/7neDK5TWoT
@realDonaldTrump your only numbers that are higher than @BarackObama is your cholesterol.
At least you did finally admit that @BarackObama is responsible. Now let's see what happens with the tariffs imposed by someone with NO clue to the world economy.
@BarackObama happy birthday Sir! Wishing u all the best life has got to over in the years ahead...

2/Primary winner @BuffyWicks was endorsed by @BarackObama . She got 31% of vote in primary. She is newcomer to district, Obama campaign veteran, has never held elected office. Lots of funding from high-end and out-of-district donors.
@BarackObama sent her the message !
@BarackObama you are a Muslim you never ever liked the United states.

@BarackObama Happy Birthday
@BarackObama You went to South Africa. Why know mention of the genocide against Afrikaners? Also, why not do something to help stop the child abuse in Hollywood?
ooh its that kind of self-righteous indignation that got me a $1500 a month medical insurance premium - thank GOD @POTUS got me a tax cut because now I can afford it. @barackobama screwed everything up - quit bellyaching until its fixed ok?
Happy belated birthday @BarackObama I hope you enjoyed EVERY second of your day!
Amen! @KingJames and @BarackObama have more class than tRump and his shallow gene puddle offspring will ever have!
Happy birthday @BarackObama Llnp #BlessUp

@BarackObama happy birthday! Honestly sir we miss you as president!
As far as #measuringup to @BarackObama you never will.
Stop dude! Stay off social media. Stop bringing up @BarackObama stop bragging on yourself! Be humble for a full year! Give credit to your administration and compliment people and start trying to Unite America via saying things like you dislike racism and will fight it. Lead US
@BarackObama Trump makes you look like a total fool. Go @realDonaldTrump ! pic.twitter.com/KanSeBMZ4j
While I thank you all for the birthday wishes just wanted to give a special shoutout to my opening act, @BarackObama
I fully support @BarackObama being indicted for treason, arrested, and given the maximum penalty.

94 months? So really what you are saying is that @POTUS44 @BarackObama did a GREAT job in getting job creation going, and DJT is riding the coattails of this effort -- the same way he's enjoying the surge in the DOW that happened under O. Got it!
Well, if @BarackObama or @whatwouldDOOdo or @Max_Scherzer or @Nationals just followed me back, this wouldn't be a problem, now would it?
@BarackObama happy Birthday, im from Germany, so either im to late already or to early

So if @SirPatStew can come back to reprise his role as Picard, can @BarackObama come back and reprise his role as...
I guess when @BarackObama continuously referenced George W Bush for 8 years he was out of line. Or does your argument only count against @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ??
@BarackObama Happy Birthday sir.
Hi @realDonaldTrump just wanted to update you on your Twitter followers, 53M. Good work, sport. Oh, @BarackObama has 101M. Have a great Sunday. Be best. #MAGA
Happy birthdays Mr. President @BarackObama I apologize for my tardiness. I hope it was a wonderful and memorable day.
Happy birthday @BarackObama Now if you done with your break could you please come back to the White House ? We the People miss you ! You could come back as @VP and have @JoeBiden as @POTUS ! We need REAL leadership...It's kind of an emergency. pic.twitter.com/QpZDUQ1E01
Happy Birthday @BarackObama ! We miss you. Please come back.
Nope. Another lie. Has anyone told you that a "red wave" is a menstrual period? By the way, happy day after your birthday, President Obama @BarackObama .
Happy compleanno @BarackObama
Hope you're having the happiest of birthdays, Mr. President, @BarackObama .
@BarackObama Happy Belated Birthday from a Canadian who was a long-time resident of a country I loved - until 2016. Now I share the shame of so many of my US friends. Can you come back & be President again? And make America truly proud again?
This is clearly @JoeBiden and @BarackObama
Hey @realDonaldTrump maybe you shouldn't be rolling back @BarackObama 's environmental policies that were put in place to help improve these conditions! You don't get to complain about what YOU are making worse! #Resign ! #TrumpIsSoOutOfTouchThat https:// nbcnews.trib.al/IhI4w1i

@BarackObama was an empty jar posterboy / figurehead amateur that was manhandled from day 1 by his party. And that makes me sad. He had so much more potential than that.
