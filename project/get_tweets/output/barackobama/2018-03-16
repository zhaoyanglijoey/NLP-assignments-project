The Evangelicals Christians has lost all Credibility in my book!!! They can never assume the moral authority! They have never once said they pray for President @BarackObama but give an admitted adulterer a Mulligan!! let that sink in!!!

Nope, he'll blame @BarackObama for not stopping it years and years ago
Dear God, this man is truly sickening. I am waiting for him to shed his skin and announce to the world that he is the Anti-Christ. @BarackObama You are the worst president ever! And that is being nice.
Once again, #TraitorTrump did Russia's bidding by just leaving & canceling @BarackObama 's opening of US/Cuba diplomacy.
Did you know, @BarackObama , that ancestors of yours housed American soldiers during the Revolutionary War? We'd love to show you the house where they stayed. Just accept our invitation. http:// bit.ly/DunhamHouse pic.twitter.com/Vl1BGf5xBp

@BarackObama Believing stereotypes yields insight into caricature, not character.Astute Friday.
If he tries pushing any kind of policy on this platform then he will be in violation of the Logan Act. I fully expect him to face the same quick, swift, and ruthless pursuit of justice that @GenFlynn received. Fair is Fair is it not @BarackObama ?
Why are you so threatened by President Obama? I realize you cannot stand on your own merit, is that why you continue to put @BarackObama because you can never been the great man and President of this already great country!
@BarackObama HELP!! Just HELP!!
@BarackObama rocked that tan suit.
I bet you, we lock up @BarackObama before @realDonaldTrump .
How did our beloved president @BarackObama destroy the country? I'd say you are the one blinded by hate & bigotry to see that he was far superior to the con man, liar, white supremacist, homophobe, rapist currently occupying 1600 Pennsylvania avenue.
I love America!!! Watched #Thirteen @KevinCostnerGM ?-Robert & John F Kennedy were amazing. Reminds me of @BarackObama w/ you know who. Makes me very proud & very scared. #Kevin Costner #America #USA #POTUS
As the great President @BarackObama once said..."Don't get mad - VOTE." They can make it hard for you...but they can't stop you - only YOU can do that. Show them how wrong & 'weak' they are by being right & strong. You COUNT. VOTE 2018. Call your local Registrar's Office & verify

@BarackObama Follow me
It's super-dumb to make a long list of people who have criticized you-- @BarackObama @iamjohnoliver @DanRather @JohnGrisham @OITNBNews @nytimes @TheGoodWife_CBS @SenatorHarkin @FailStateMovie @Bob_Shireman +me. At some point, folks might say, maybe it's not them; maybe it's you.
Then under this theory @BarackObama was also a serious threat to national security since Russia tapping the electrical grids and interfering with the election happened on his watch.
Perhaps if we had a joint statememt from other military officials and the five former presidents, we can initiate a serious campaign to remove Trump from office. I don't know what we're waiting for (and I don't want to know). @BarackObama @GeorgeHWBush @BillClinton @GeorgeWBush

Rev. Wright called @BarackObama , on tape, a liar. Why isn't this being looked into? It would be a great commercial for the republicans. May 22, 2012 http:// ift.tt/2piihMr #TrumpCriticizesTrump
they couldn't tell or recognize a smart guy Nobel Prize winner if he was standin' right in front of their faces, someone like @BarackObama for instance.
I never saw it as inaction, I saw it as aggressive action - refusal to respect @BarackObama 's Presidency and Democrat voters' rights to have their will expressed via their elected officials. In other words, War.
Thank you @BarackObama . Great job!

@BarackObama started this by making opiods legal in spring of 2016. He did everything he could to destroy America. So happy we finally have a President working to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!! THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump ! LOVE YOU!!
@BarackObama what do we do? It's so bad out there. You are deeply missed.
@AGJeffBSessions @BarackObama If true that Obama let criminals get weapons so Obama could push a confiscation program he needs to be locked up. I'm not depending on getting much out of your Jeff since you lied to get AG job. Once in a while blink your eyes.
@SenMajLdr is a small man and a coward! He robbed you of that position because of his bias against @BarackObama . America will be back on track in a few months, Mitch and his cronies will have to suffer their karma
