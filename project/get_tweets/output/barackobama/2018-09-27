Absolutely! #MarieHarf who worked for . @BarackObama is either DEAF, Blind or JUST SIMPLY STUPID. #Women all over #America saw an Innocent man defending his GOOD name. NORMAL Women will VOTE #Republicans They saw a KABUKI Theater run by . @TheDemocrats who Made FOOLS of themselves
@WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton @BarackObama
I'm going to curl up in a ball and cry myself to sleep thinking of the impending doom that awaits us. What I need right now is a big ol' bear hug from @BarackObama & @JoeBiden .
@senatemajldr So it is OK to stonewall #MerrickGarland when @BarackObama nominates him but you'll ram #Kavanaugh nomination through if it's the last thing you do. If #ChristineBlaseyFord were your daughter you wouldn't be so dismissive. We the people...are pretty damn furious.
#Guilty #Guilty #Guilty !!!! You could tell #Kavanagh was pissed off for being caught ..and that his power hungry lifetime career will be a never happening event Vote NO! @TheUSACongress @usasenatetweets @BarackObama
Welcome... I was a Republican until McCain picked that asshat Palin. Then I actually started paying attention. Then I looked more into @BarackObama . Then I realized who I wanted as President. I hopped on his campaign for election and re-election. I never looked back...
@BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @VP @SpeakerRyan @senatemajldr I blame Obama. If he had seized control of our government and declared himself President-for-Life like the god damned Republicans said he would, we wouldn't be in this mess....

@BarackObama wrote all we though about in high school was getting high and getting laid - has any @senjudiciary @SenateDems questioned his motives and made a leap into Obama was a rapist? No. Because @CoryBooker it. is. illogical. SIT DOWN and Barack? SPEAK UP YOU COWARD.
I'm worried about this decision. You have a winning lead and I'm thrilled. I really don't think this is the best idea. Now if we can get @BarackObama to come here, THAT will be awesome.
Obama is one of the worst things to happen to this country since 9/11 and no doubt the worst president ever. That ugly tranny really needs to go away. @MichelleObama @BarackObama https:// go.shr.lc/2xLmATU - @washtimes
Thanks @BarackObama !
@LindseyGrahamSC You are such a hypocrite! You and your Senate cronies denied #MerrickGarland a confirmation hearing and due process when @BarackObama nominated him. Not so nice when you're on the receiving end, huh? Your tantrum today was something else. Bravo! #DramaQueen
I thought @BarackObama @POTUS44 said that was impossible?
@seanhannity actually, the BIGGEST smear campaign was of @BarackObama by the birthers and the people claiming he was Muslim. @realDonaldTrump #fuckyouhannity
Watching the #Kavanaugh hearings. Politically #MerrickGarland would've sucked as well. @BarackObama should've picked a progressive judge to avoid cornering Americans into the lesser of 2 evils. Neither political party should be considered heroes for waiting too long on this.
Not anymore. You are now guilty if your politics are not socialist leaning to @TheDemocrats . @BarackObama called it "Fundamental Transormation." Damn #Alinskyites .

@BarackObama please help this country get back to having norms in politics - we're scared out here!!!
@SenThomTillis Why didn't you allow a vote on #MerrickGarland ? Don't sound so high and mighty. It didn't matter who @BarackObama nominated, you were never allowing a hearing. Who played games? #Hypocrites
@LindseyGrahamSC Respectfully, don't forget about @BarackObama & nominee Merrick Garland. As an American, I would hope both Reps and Dems would put truth & fact finding first & set partisan politics aside re: #SCOTUS decision. #BrettKavanaughHearing
@POTUS can we please hold @HillaryClinton , @BarackObama accountable for their crimes now? #clintonfoundation , #UraniumOne , #Benghazi

On the contrary, @LindseyGrahamSC is a #hypocrite whose outrage was nowhere to be found when @SenMajLdr McConnell left an unprecedented gap on the #SCOTUS so as to deny @BarackObama his nominee. We see you, @GOP . We see you.
I voted for @BarackObama twice but will be voting a straight @GOP ticket this year because of how much @TheDemocrats have turned me off.
Ye f*** (sorry, mess) around & win 2020 presidency @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama
you mean because he is a p grabber and like you? What about his victim? Any thoughts there? Was it a tactic to delay like when cocaine Mitch delayed the greatest President Barack @BarackObama his choice for over a year? Are you out of your mind? The senate must not vote.
Leakers @JamesComeyFBI @DianeFeinstein #Mccabe @BarackObama @HillaryClinton
He worked for Bush @whitehouse what did you think? His ideology would mirror @BarackObama ? Democrats have proved to voters they are not to be trusted with power in congress. POLITICAL ASSASSINATION FAILED TODAY.
At least you know that @BarackObama gifs are the way to my heart.
@BarackObama You will always be my President.
@BarackObama Mr. President, our country has gone to s**t. Something must be done about this current administration, wow.
@BarackObama Baby Come Back, that is our national SOS song.
A president that is under investigation nominates someone and Senator Graham says it is a "SHAM" when other senators want to cross T's and dot I's? What word would he use to describe what they did to the nominee of the honorable former President @BarackObama ? #worldnewstonight

@BarackObama I had rice and miso soup for breakfast.
@BarackObama @SenSherrodBrown @LindseyGraham You decry a SHAM in Kavanaugh's hearing? Let me remind you the REAL SHAM was when Mitch McConnell and the rest of the crooked Republicans refused to even hold one hearing on Judge Garland's nomination with months left in Obama's term.
dear @LindseyGrahamSC we've watched for nearly 10 long years now as the @GOP --both @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP have obstructed & out right BLOCKED nominees & more under @BarackObama . #Republicans behavior is #Deplorable !
@DanaBashCNN @cnn @LindseyGrahamSC @wolfblitzer *No @LindseyGrahamSC , the most unethical shame in politics history was when your so called best friend John McCain voted no on the @BarackObama care repeal and you voted yes for it. Facts . Thank you

Remember when @BarackObama wore a tan suit? How did we ever survive?
No pearls to clutch @LindseyGrahamSC . Kavanaugh can remember specific dates he drank in high school but you seem to forget last year when you blocked @BarackObama 's appointment #Republicans
Reasons to obstruct Garland's nomination: 1. Chosen by @BarackObama Reasons to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination: 1. Multiple accounts of sexual assault 2. Twisting the truth under oath 3. Blatant partisanship shown in testimony Which instance was disgraceful again?

@LindseyGrahamSC what about the sham you perpetrated on @BarackObama s pick to the @scuswebsite ?????? Both D and R pull this crap!
But it was OK for @MitchPOTUS & the Senate to deny #MerrickGarland a meeting, a hearing, & due process when @BarackObama nominated him. Now with Kavanaugh, it's all the Democrats fault. Nice double standard there @realDonaldTrump . Try #GoldenRule . It stands the test of time.

@LindseyGrahamSC I think the bigger unethical sham was the @GOP @SenateGop refusing to hold a hearing for #MerrickGarland the @SCOTUS nominee of @POTUS44 @BarackObama and holding that seat open for more than 400 days, that is a far bigger unethical sham.
#LindseyGrahamCompromised BY SAME #DarkMoney @POTUS @senatemajldr IS. Also.. SO #LindseyGraham , That's how you interview for #JeffSessions Job?? #NeverForget how @BarackObama & #MerrickGarland were treated!
Please respond to the GOP who are quoting your FBI statement during the Anita Hill trial. They only quote Democrats, @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @BillClinton when it benefits them. So, it's up to Dems to push back.
I'm all against petty, miserable obstructionists like the @GOP which for six years blocked everything that @BarackObama tried to work for. I'm also all about getting at the truth. Women need to be heard because for too damn long they were told shut up and do what you're told!
Last, but definitely not least - @BarackObama was just as sharp, warm, wise and brave as you would think of @POTUS44 . Thank you for coming to Finland and sharing valuable insights with us in #NBForum2018 .
Some how the @GOP are still blaming the #Clintons ... Because #Kavanaugh isn't fit for #SCOTUS . Somehow it's the Clintons fault. Thanks a lot @BarackObama .
@LindseyGrahamSC you absolute spineless geriatric shit stain, you were a part of the committee that refused to hear @BarackObama 's pick on a hold put for 2016, and now you refute the same because you're on the hotplate. Well, I hope you fucking burn. Unbelievable.

@GOP @SenateGOP GIVE ME A BREAK! You assholes worked for 8 yrs to disrupt, obstruct & stop work against @BarackObama while he was POTUS, and you have the gall to call out Dems for following your playbook- #HYPOCRITES !
We should have had Merrick Garland and there would be no questions. He had a clean history. Oh, yeah, @BarackObama wanted him.
@ThomTillis . Your memory is slipping. Your leader made the comment early in @BarackObama presidency that it would be the goal of Republicans to obstruct him in every way. Oh by the way, #MerrickGarland
Oh. Ok. How can I inquire about @FBI investigation into @BarackObama and @HilaryClinton treasons. Asking for a friend.
@BarackObama had an #IvyLeague pedigree & was constantly questioned, doubt cast on his actual performance, which was stellar. George W. & that Man in the WH had same pedigrees, were deeply flawed human beings in different ways. Pedigree & brains do not guarantee anything.
Watching the #KavanaughConfirmationHearing really makes me angry about the fact that the @SenateGOP blocked @BarackObama from nominating a Supreme Court Justice. Their fake indignation is pathetic. #NoJustice
Post @BarackObama generations have a right to vote their opinion and in the next and current midterm elections does America want corporate greed to influence our courts to reduce what previous presidents created as protected for future generations?
like the one the Republicans refused to acknowledge or vote on - remember @BarackObama Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court on March 16, 2016 - here it is almost 2019 so why can't the republicans delay things for a week

Their holier than thou act after the way they treated @BarackObama with a lot of masked racism and his appointees is beyond me. How Senator Graham can pretend to be angry at the process would be funny if not near criminal #shameful
Watching the #KavanaughHearings , Americans are still being subjected to the decisive continuation of trumps #2016campaign although entertaining for us #post @BarackObama generations is not what a @Scotus nomination is for.

So far, no one has executed an effective coup on the executive branch, as @senatemajldr did with @BarackObama with Garland. No one has abused the constitution as McConnell did. So tune your outrage proportionately.
The most "unethical sham in politics" is when McConnel refused to allow a vote for @BarackObama 's Judicial Nominee (Merrick Garland). The remarks by @LindseyGrahamSC are not only extremely hypocritical, they are painful to hear (apologizing to the alleged offender). Shameful!

Why is this necessary? This is ridiculous The @dnc @georgesoros @HillaryClinton @BarackObama has already paid them ALL off! Who is donating? @POTUS stop the funneling of pic.twitter.com/EAE4ahs5VY

Saw Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing statement. He was angry & he's right; what goes around, comes around. He endured 2 weeks of his name being smeared. But @BarackObama & @MichelleObama endured 8 years of lies and smears. @realDonaldTrump reaps what he sows. #KavanaughHearings
Hey @CNN , @NBCNews & @nytimes . Look how unfair the #GOP senators are. I am sure, in 2 years you will have forgotten that. @BarackObama was unfairly shamed for NOTHING!!!!
The best liar is he who makes the smallest amount of lying go the longest way. @SenBlumenthal @SenFeinstein @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @DNC #ConfirmKavanaughNow
@BarackObama @MichelleObama @Trevornoah @StephenKing @KingJames @Cubs @BetteMidler @Kandi @MackMAC33162565
Just like @BarackObama needed just 4 more months for the economy to get really going.....
The #GOP 's furor over the delay in airing the accusations falls incredibly flat considering they blocked @BarackObama nominations. #KavaNO #KavanaughHearings
Brian, Garland was nominated in 2016, a Presidential Election Year that @BarackObama was not running in, thus the #BidenRule was in play, and the DNC just couldn't accept that the GOP respected THEIR RULES!
Buenisima parodia hacia @BarackObama de @JordanPeele
inst it Ironic that Senator Grassley would say it was taking to long from when a nominee is chose and when they are confirmed lol How long was it from when @BarackObama Nominated Merrick Garland over a year? #KavanaughFord Grassley
@BarackObama you know what to do chief
#funny how #republicans are so concerned with the #time being taken to get #BrettKavanaugh #approved but, for over a year they denied #MerrickGarland a hearing and disrespected and denied @BarackObama his right as #potus #Republicans are #corrupt
Grassley says 60 to 70 days is too long? Merrick Garland.... how long from when @BarackObama announced him and when a vote was taken?
@ChuckGrassley you should be ashamed of yourself. You guys wouldn't let @BarackObama bring his pick, but yet you want to slam through this guy of very questionable character. His defense of himself, shows a man unhinged. @BrettKavanaugh
It would be the sweetest revenge after @TheDemocrats take back the @WhiteHouse and gain majorities in the House and Senate to get @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton on the SCOTUS.
The irony of @SenateGOP lecturing about civility during #KavanaughHearings when they denied @BarackObama his #SCOTUSNomination . THAT was a real disgrace. The standard bearer of their party is a disgrace. The way they subvert the will of American people is a disgrace...
@ChuckGrassley your pathetic grandstanding in regards to how long this process is taking is a sham and a lie! How come you were never concerned with the over one year left in @BarackObama presidency when his choice #MerrickGarland was not even allowed a single hearing? #FRAUD !
#GOP senators talking about irony is ironical, since they didn't allow President @BarackObama 's nominee for the @SCOTUS to move forward. #KavanaghHearings
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton @SenFeinstein et al. the anti-American pro-Socialist Liberal Democrats are guilty of obstruction, division, spread socialism, hatred, racism, evil, and anti-American rhetorhic.

@ChuckGrassley : How many days passed between the time that #MerrickGarland was nominated by @BarackObama and the Senate vote to confirm? #TYTLive
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC You wanna know what the most "unethical sham" is... Was YOU holding open @BarackObama #SCOTUS seat and REFUSING to even meet with him or hold hearings. The #GOP is a SHAM. Stop the #KavanaughHearings . He does NOT deserve to be a #SCOTUSpick .
I cant wait till #BrettKavanaugh blames @BarackObama for all this. #KavanaghHearing and for the record @ChuckGrassley is despicable, as is @LindseyGrahamSC
@BarackObama I am sorry, voted still lost
@BarackObama I'm an alcoholic. I only drank beer. Drank bottles & bottles of beer from 16-32 yrs. old.. Now I'm close to 68 yrs. old., over 30yrs. sober. The man seeking the supreme court spot, regardless of the outcome, needs sobriety, no alcohol ever just like your replacement.
The irony of @SenateGOP yelling about civility during #KavanaughHearings when they denied @BarackObama his #SCOTUSNomination . THAT was a real disgrace Senators. The standard bearer of your party is a disgrace. The way you subvert the will of American people is a disgrace...
@BarackObama what is nowhere Birthday? What does that mean?
What did @BarackObama say? #DontGetMadVOTE
@BarackObama ur the best president ever.
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC , do you remember about 15 minutes after President @BarackObama announced the @garland_merrick nomination, when you said you wouldn't even give him a hearing? And now you're complaining about travesties of justice?
#KavanaughHearings Merrick Garland @BarackObama "After the death of Scalia, Republican Senate leaders announced that they planned to hold no vote on any potential nomination during the president's last year in office ... 293 days" https:// rodaw.me/2OjcOTj
@LindseyGrahamSC , did you think Mitch @senatemajldr McConnell's treatment of @POTUS44 @BarackObama , blatantly denying any SCOTUS nomination because of his vow to stop anything day 1 was a disgusting or disgraceful act, or was that okay because he's on your team? #LiarsFaceKarma
No, @ChuckGrassley you lying son-of-a-bitch, the worst thing that has happened in the modern history of judicial nominations BAR NONE, is what your party did to @BarackObama and his nominee, @garland_merrick !
@BarackObama you ever try to put yourself back in that seat again, and millions of Americans will cry out for your blood and your hide. We will gladly put you in the ground you traitorous bitch. Semper Fi mother fucker
@tedcruz when referencing Judge Kavanaugh's drinking in high school and college reference @BarackObama cocaine and marijuana use
@Barackobama May 11, 1998
Is that not hypocritical @SenatorBurr ? Yes, Trump has a right to nominate for a vacancy. But so did @BarackObama and you stood in the way of that. Then you very strongly stated that if @HillaryClinton was elected that would do anything to ensure that seat remained vacant.
Didn't watch yet, @SenatorBooker of their poking fun at you but too bad unlike @BarackObama , you're flightless withu big old Germanic ears even though MSM always says he is "black" (like my cousin @michaelaadam and my Dad from his great-grandfather Edward VII) ... pic.twitter.com/GvfBTnBVjH
GOP STOLE President @BarackObama nominee's seat for SCOTUS Merrick Garland! DIDN'T respect him, give him a HEARING, has the chutzpah to call Democrats doing "con job" on Kavanaugh hearing. Really?
Great performance by @LindseyGrahamSC . Where was his sense of decency and fair play when he and the @GOP rejected categorically, every improvement, project, law, or appointment, simply because it was introduced by President @BarackObama ? FBI investigation please
Never in a million years would @BarackObama have nominated such a scumbag to the Supreme Court. And I firmly believe if somehow he had, he'd withdraw the nomination. Like a real President would do. #imissmypresident
@LindseyGrahamSC remind me about this Power you speak of. Correct me if I am wrong but was it not you & the rest of your GOP members that would not allow then President @BarackObama to put his candidate for the Supreme Court in 2016? Was it not you & your fellow GOP that would
Along with the @BarackObama Presidential Administration and Hillary Clinton.
@BarackObama your full of shit. But I do got to thank you for VRAP. but your still full of shit. LOL!!!!
What did the #Republican party do to @BarackObama ; Wjhat did @MitchMcConnell say the senates job was to do regarding @BarackObama , did that block a judge appointment of his. We all must be god damned fools if we don't see hypocrisy.

@LindseyGrahamSC quit talking about fairness because if you meant what you said @BarackObama Supreme Court pick would have at least had a hearing but you and @senatemajldr being the #angrywhitemen you are stalled the process. #Hypocrites #Hypocrisy
This false indignation by @LindseyGrahamSC is sickening. Especially after what they did to President @BarackObama 's nominee Merrick Garland. The "National Disgrace" is the misogyny of the GOP. #FB
@BarackObama PRESIDENT OBAMA. I MISS YOU SO MUCH AND THE DIGNITY YOU BROUGHT TO THE W.H. WHICH HAS TOTALLY DISAPPEARED. I KNOW YOUR GOOD BUDS WITH JOE , PLEASE TALK TO HIM TO RUN IN 2020 WE NEED HIM. HE'S THE ONE PERSON WHO CAN PUT PUDDIN HEAD IN HIS PLACE. AMERICA NEEDS HIM.
@LindseyGrahamSC 's repeated outbursts about fairness & legitimate politics are ridiculous considering @realDonaldTrump 's comments about grabbing women's body parts & repeated attacks on @BarackObama & family. Where was his righteous anger then?

If Dems want to blame anyone for where their party is today, look no further than @BarackObama His 8 yrs in office ruined the party.

@FoxNews it is an absolute disgrace that @harpfmaria is on with a bunch of seasoned vets. @BarackObama liberal nut
It's very weird that we are examining #Kavanaugh 's high school yearbook and calendar but never saw @BarackObama 's college transcripts.
@BarackObama spent his entire high school years getting High. That was when pot was VER ILLEGAL!

Waiting for the fact checks. I really doubt this it true. And, if it is true, all the thanks goes to @BarackObama . You've done nothing to contribute to it.
This is what happens when people stay home and don't vote. God help our democracy. @BarackObama Kavanaugh hyper partisan mess. #voteblue
It's very weird that we are examining #Kavanaugh 's high school yearbook and calendar but never saw @BarackObama 's college transcripts.
@SenFeinstein @LindseyGrahamSC Graham, you might not have done this to Sotomayor or Kagan, but you did far worse to Merrick Garland and @BarackObama You started the partisan war.
@HarfMaria U repeated A LIE ABT @POTUS separating FAMILY'S U worked 4 @BarackObama Administration THAT separated more children ftheir families than any other PRESIDENT &PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 2 write & executive ORDER 2 STOP separation U &@FoxNews 2 continue 2 LIE W/PHONY outrage
#KavanaughHearings Somebody convince me that @BarackObama asked the FBI to reopen the investigation of @HillaryClinton 9 days before the 2016 election.
@LindseyGrahamSC THANK YOU SIR! #AMERICAFIRST #IStandWithBrettKavanaugh #ConfirmKavanaughNow This is the biggest SCAM against America since @BarackObama was thrown on US! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@BarackObama
Rosenstein meeting delayed. Tick tock... @HillaryClinton @BarackObama
Oh, you mean like you held up @BarackObama 's nomination waiting for the election??? Hey pot, this is the kettle, you're black...
Well besides @BarackObama
@LindseyGrahamSC I liked your act. Seems like you might want to look at the past 8 years. I remember your boy McConnell saying that he would make @BarackObama a one term president. But yeah let's keep the faux outrage up.
Dear Sir: I miss you terribly. If it is at all possible, could you help us elect a fine man named Andrew Gillum to the governorship of Florida? Your endorsement would carry huge weight and we'd be forever grateful! Sincerely, a two time @BarackObama voter and lifetime fan!
#LindseyGraham had a temper tantrum melt down, just like #Kavanaugh because they're losing. @BarackObama didn't cry or pound his fists when Mitch refused to even give a hearing to #MerrickGarland (who BTW is Brett's boss and not a madman.) Stop the insanity, #StopKavanaugh
@BarackObama I know you are crazy busy, but I also know you love hiking. If you are ever passing through Atlanta, I would be honored--to say the least--to take you for a hike and share with you how special our city is.

Hey @LindseyGrahamSC dont you think dems and @BarackObama and Merrick Garland felt just like you do?!? #karma
Interesting how #GOP has decided the #KavanaughHearings are the MOMENT that government went to hell. Not @realDonaldTrump , not when @senatemajldr came out and said his job was to obstruct @BarackObama administration. You created the circus. Unreal.
Really? You were in office when @BarackObama was president right? When he was hung in effigy for his young daughters to see? You were here when @SenMajLdr said he would make sure @BarakObama would not get one bill passed? Amnesia?
Faulted memory @GOP , wouldn't have a hearing for @BarackObama SCOTUS pick keep seat open for over 400 days and you're off the rails because society wants the truth about Kavanaugh. #Hypocrisy
THANKS TO PRESIDENT @BarackObama
#KavanaughHearings of course we've lost all decency just look at the @DNC @Alyssa_Milano W/her face right in the camera at all times, BC of @BarackObama being Hollywood's President, PPL from Hollywood like @Alyssa_Milano think they can make everything a Disgusting Spectacle
@LindseyGrahamSC is a drama queen and a hypocrite. Where was all this self righteous indignation when @BarackObama 's nominee couldn't get a hearing?! To hell with you and the @GOP
. @LindseyGrahamSC you want to talk about a national sham and disgrace? How about we talk about how your party refused to act on a legitimate #SCOTUS nomination, Merrick Garland, brought forth by @BarackObama , left open for 293 days. Duty was ignored for Party. #KavanaughHearings
When will they ask former Sec. @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama ABOUT THE BENGHAZI MURDERS, like this?!!? @realDonaldTrump @KrisParonto
Who loves beer more than #Kavanaugh ? It's @BarackObama https:// buff.ly/2xWhXXd
@LindseyGrahamSC the most despicable thing I've seen in politics I've ever seen was when Scalia's body wasn't even cold Mitch McConnell told @BarackObama he'd not fill that seat. So pardon me if I tell you to shove your #AlternativeFacts and false outrage and shove it up your.
No, Lindsey, that's what Y'ALL did with MERRICK GARLAND'S confirmation at the end of @BarackObama 's term. Own it.
The Dems made no #sexassault accusations against Gorsuch which disproves #Trump 's paranoid conspiracy theories that the Dems will make up any lies to smear nominees just because he's unpopular & @senatemajldr stole a seat on #SCOTUS from @BarackObama
@LindseyGrahamSC When @BarackObama nominated judge Garland... @SenMajLdr blocked it for a fucking year! So go FUCK YOURSELF you trump lapdog!! #KavaNOPE #NoToKavanaugh
I need a beer watching @LindseyGrahamSC peacock and perform at the #KavanaughHearings If this is the most despicable thing he's ever seen in politics, he slept through @BarackObama 's administration and ignorant of American history.
@LindseyGrahamSC saying "these have been my friends" about @SenateDems . Gee, he should review how @SenateGOP treated @BarackObama
Who are you watching? And did you know @BarackObama follows you?!
. @BarackObama said he did COCAINE in high school & we have to sit hear & listen to whether or not #Kavanaugh drank beer in high school? #KavanaughConfirmation #Kavanaughhearings
@HillaryClinton @BarackObama #TheDemocrats any more questions?
@LindseyGrahamSC what you did to @BarackObama was the biggest sham in politics. Your dramatics were a bit much. #liar
I definitely missed @LindseyGrahamSC 's raging, righteous morality when he and the GOP *stole* @BarackObama 's #supremecourt seat in 2016. #brettkavanaugh
Give me a break @LindseyGrahamSC . Where was your outrage when @realDonaldTrump was bragging about grabbing pussys? Where were your morals when your "friends" were obstructing filling a vacant SCOTUS seat so President @BarackObama couldn't nominate. Stop auditioning you fraud.
"If you haven't learn to be a partner with somebody, how to worktogether make compromises have disagreements... If you haven't learn to do that in your primary relationship, it becomes difficult to it with the people you're working with." @BarackObama at #NBForum2018
Only twice in my life have I been ashamed to be American: election of @BarackObama and now the / #SCOTUS hearings. An absolute circus!
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC is called this the biggest, most unethical political sham since he's been a politician... I guess he wasn't a Senator during @BarackObama 's nomination of Merrick Garland.................. The hypocrisy drives me insane. #KavanaughHearings
Graham completely unhinged about a Supreme Court Seat. #MerrickGarland @BarackObama was POTUS for 11 months after Scalia died. You're completely full of it. #SHAM
@LindseyGrahamSC should get an Oscar today. Don't blame the Dems for how DC is, @senatemajldr started the "win at any cost" when he said upon @BarackObama win, that the GOP would never work w/him. But good performance @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC wow!! @realDonaldTrump has taught you well you low down shill. Kavanaugh did EVERYTHING Dr Ford said. You are pathetic!! You can steal @BarackObama pic but cant take the heat when its on YOU!!
. @sengraham2016 clearly doesn't recall . @senatemajldr stating how he would do everything in his power to limit . @BarackObama to a single term & be as obstructionist as possible #KavanaughHearings
can we consult Merrick Garland about unethical shams when it comes to the judicial nomination/hearing process? How about @BarackObama #Kavenaugh
Has Senator #Graham forgotten that time @BarackObama made a #SCOTUS nomination #MerrickGarland #StopKavanaughNow
Remember when the GOP blocked President @BarackObama from nominating a SCJ? #KavanaughHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC was perfectly happy to pledge, upon inauguration of @BarackObama , that the #Republicans would make their EVERY action in direct opposition to anything he proposed. #Hypocrites #ChickensComingHomeToRoost
Maybe, @LindseyGrahamSC , if the @GOP hadn't started the ultra partisan politics practices during the @BarackObama presidency, then the state of politics between Republicans and Democrats wouldn't be in the state it is today. #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC 's feigned anger about a fair process is ridiculous considering that he wouldn't even give @BarackObama 's nominee a hearing because he wanted to (and indeed did) hold the seat open. #Kavanaugh #KavanaughFord #KavanaughConfirmation
Why is @BarackObama not being investigated? All the proof the "left" needs to convict a man of "Sexual Assault" is right here! A woman is accusing him of this, so your "logic" tells us she has to be telling the truth! No time to waste @FBI go catch a rapist and lock him up! pic.twitter.com/z9GWo22plh
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC where was your outrage when YOUR FUCKING PARTY stole the @SCOTUS nominee from @BarackObama ?
@LindseyGrahamSC your pretend indignation isn't impressing anyone. @SenateDems you had better call him on his #MerrickGarland bullshit and how he wouldn't pass one bill of @BarackObama
I feel like Lindsey Graham conveniently forgets that they stole a supreme court seat, and obstructed @BarackObama for 8 years. What a joke this guy is.
. @LindseyGrahamSC This is unreal.... the men who said they would never seat a SCOTUS judge under @HillaryClinton and denied one to @BarackObama are *accusing the Dems* of trying to hold the seat open.
@LindseyGrahamSC you are a disgrace to SC. Ur republican counterparts did the same to @BarackObama and u saw no problem with it then. Now all of u are acting like children. #KavanaughHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC were you aware that you refused to bring a Supreme Court Nominee to a vote under @BarackObama . #StopKavanaugh
Fix it before it's too late, Not even with @BarackObama Stay away from these people & follow your own path. You made here without them so keep it this way, believe it or not this is your time, you don't need them. You just need to believe in yourself. @AndrewGillum
A fair process ? @LindseyGrahamSC how fair were you to @BarackObama choice. Back down. Take your bp meds #gopcircus
@LindseyGrahamSC seems to have forgotten about his position on the Supreme Court when @BarackObama was president. #CrocodileTears
@BarackObama we need you. @MichelleObama leave him to pick up the phone
@LindseyGrahamSC F' you Lindsey, you guys held the #SCOTUS seat open for over 1 year when @BarackObama nominated #MerrickGarland !
Really @LindseyGrahamSC Do you remember the nominee put up by @BarackObama YOU HAVE LOST YOUR MIND??? #KavanaughHearings
@BarackObama You know something about the Constitution: can #SCOTUS refuse to let #Kavanaugh join them? #KavaNO #FordHearing #FordKavanaugh

@BarackObama is a fraud
The precedent was set by @senatemajldr McConnell went so far as to make up a bullshit new set rules to screw over @BarackObama - MERRICK GARLAND was 1,000x the candidate Kavanaugh is.
Please imagine...after eight years....not just a couple of weeks...of non-stop attacks on his character...had President @BarackObama flipped out and lost his cool like Kavanaugh did today...EVEN ONE TIME....he would have been crucified. #GOPsetthestandard
