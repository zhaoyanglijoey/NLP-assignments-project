#POTUS @BarackObama Breezes by for 8 years with one single very disturbing scandal, his distinguished self was caught wearing a beige suit. How dare he...yet the REPUBLICAN party, 45 and all of you minion politicians are chalk full of scandal, deep, voluminous, and shameful.

No thanks. I still wake up in a cold sweat some nights having nightmares that the traitorous bastard @BarackObama is still Prez. Thank God he's not. Thank God for @realDonaldTrump !
It's not a criminal investigation nor has he been charged with anything after 2 years. Collusion is not a crime nor did he collude with anybody. The real ones to worry about are @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama .
I wonder what @BarackObama is doing today...
WRONG! not even close. a new Research Poll asked "Which President has done the best job during your lifetime?" RESULTS: - @BarackObama - 44% (best of this generation) - @BillClinton - 33% - Ronald Reagan - 32% - @realDonaldTrump - 19% Trump, you LOSE again! Womp... Womp...
Hey @SpeakerRyan you followed this advice about @BarackObama when???
Those countries have been increasing NATO spending since the @BarackObama administration. Stop lying to the American public and start leading them!
Ya mean like #FakeObama ? He broke my heart. People need to wake up & fast. He is running a shadow government in his home in D.C. This is no joke. Not only are @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton terrified of prison, they will do ANYTHING to stay out of prison. Including #FalseFlags
Hey @SpeakerRyan when @BarackObama was on overseas trips you wouldn't shut the fuck up about the "apology tour" though?
Once @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr get the Criminals in power there is no getting them out. Dems are screwed forever! they will rig everything in their favor! but Dems want 2b civil @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @BarackObama @GovHowardDean @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid

Am I the only person who is surprised that #Trump didn't blame @BarackObama for the 12 boys & their #soccer #coach getting #trapped in the northern #Thailand #Cave , & then take credit for the #ThaiCaveResue ? #PetulentJuvenile #StainOnAmerica #NATO #Germany #Canada #Mex #TradeWar
From my point of view - The only one he ever feared aka #Dumbledore is @BarackObama The lovable & loyal #Hagrid is @JoeBiden The defender of children (& women) #McGonagall is @HillaryClinton as for the other side use your imagine.

@BarackObama Someday you will write the tell all on the whitehouse. Maybe then I'll understand why you've gone quietly into that dark knight. I can imagine. But at this point, you're losing your voice. Once you were the beacon of hope. Now, just a reminder of our hopelessness
Shame on you for claiming the current stability of the economy as @POTUS work. We all know an economy doesn't just take off. You should call @BarackObama and thank him for his dedication to our country. Terrible @VP and @realDonaldTrump are pillaging us into oblivion.
So if he doesn't trust someone & they happen to be Black, then they're Racist? Sounds like you only see @BarackObama for the color of his skin & not for his character.... which makes you the Racist.

@BarackObama We voted for you, would you vote for us? The smallest amount you can donate is 5 bucks. Could you find the time to have a peek at our campaign? Thank You. We just need some good old fashioned @BarackObama @MichelleObama encouragement. One citizen on a mission.

Checking the post for a reply to a letter written to @BarackObama & @MichelleObama is the adult version of waiting for your Hogwarts letter
@lisapage not showing up to her subpoena to meet with Congress, this troll just do what ever she wants, she forgets that @BarackObama is not President anymore, not that he ever was. I say lock the troll up before @HillaryClinton suicides her. #MAGA #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
@BarackObama Mr President, I know you are no longer our Commander, but you are a constitutional scholar. Is there anything individual citizens can do to halt the unravelling of our democracy? How might we force Congress to act before it's too late?
Definitely @BarackObama !!!
@BarackObama was a failure.
These lines: "I think he is just misunderstood." "I don't think he is a racist?" "I don't think he has emboldened racists?" "Racism was just as bad under Obama." @BarackObama being Pres. is what began to bring racists out of hiding. Trump giving racists a platform did just that
@BarackObama also lied on national tv considering he used a alias to communicate with @HillaryClinton showing clear intent & knowledge of wrongdoing by both. I guess the @TheJusticeDept , @FBI & @jeffsessions don't care about equal justice as they destroy @GenFlynn 's life
Thank you, President Obama @BarackObama
@eLBARADEI @AlsissiOfficial @BarackObama @eucopresident and thats why there was my idea of IBSP in about 1992-1994 or something @PutinRF_Eng then IBP #Egypt pictures 2012
Thank you, President Obama @BarackObama
@HillaryClinton @BarackObama DONALD TRUMP IS A BAD-ASS at least he cares about America
That is so ironic coming from you who engaged in a fit of partisan politics and denied @BarackObama his pick for the Supreme Court. Your blatent hypocrisy is ridiculous and if it was not weakening our institutions it would be laughable at how ridiculous you are. #scotus
Does she really even need to do this... They have all the evidence they need to put them all in jail... @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @JamesComeyFBI @AndrewMcCabeFBI shall I go on....????? When's this show gonna be over???
Appreciated @BarackObama explaining why fairer voting districts is so crucial for our #democracy - "Politicians shouldn't pick their voters, voters are supposed to pick their politicians" Thanks @EricHolder and @DemRedistrict for your push in this. https:// youtu.be/YyIWjO94Lnk
What year was @BarackObama elected? 2008? Weird coincidence...
@realDonaldTrump thank you for being my president. We gave the vampires the keys to the blood bank with @BarackObama we will fight we will #MAGA #safespots are where you lose freedom. Its won by the brave
Twitter followers: @BarackObama - 104M @realDonaldTrump - 53.4M
A New Pew Research Poll asked "Which President has done the best job during your lifetime?" RESULTS: - @BarackObama - 44% (best of this generation) - @BillClinton - 33% - Ronald Reagan - 32% - @realDonaldTrump - 19% Dear President Trump, you LOSE again! Womp... Womp...
Was it @BarackObama & @MichelleObama ?? Hahahaha
I want to get this out there before the #2020race @CoryBooker is no @BarackObama . Lets make it clear before his spin machine tries to convince anyone. Unlike #Obama , @CoryBooker grew up in a middle class & choose to live in urban housing area of Newark NJ for political gains .
Hey Chuck, he's not sneaking in a nominee. It's his Constitutional Authority. In the words of your messiah @BarackObama "Elections have Consequences!" Deal with it!
@BarackObama the best thing since sliced bread
@BarackObama what is the truth
@BarackObama EX-PRESIDENT
Real poll. Real world. Not the FOX propaganda you live on. @BarackObama we love you! We miss your impeccable patriotic leadership!
Someone once tweeted that @BarackObama was a great president!! HAHAHA Dumbest tweet ever for sure!!
I nominate @BarackObama
Absolutely i agree @BarackObama now Pres Clinton did good thgs 4the ppl a surplus but he did f**k up 2 sadly but true . Press GHWB & GWB they were not great but had respect 4the office & What we have now is a Traitor working 4the enemy Russia/Putin
The democrats were in office when @SenateMajLdr stole @BarackObama SC appointment. So you are wrong again as usual. Just resign before you are disgraced
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @DNC You people are a bunch of malcontents & are so unintelligent you ARE sub-human at best, you will live to see failure in ur life. @FoxNews @BarackObama the Racist.
You mean like @BarackObama did twice. Before Republitards obstructed his choice?
@BarackObama and Obama too
Thank you @sahouraxo for bringing these facts to the audience! Operation Timber Sycamore @BarackObama

Big thanks to @BarackObama and the Gnome King for protecting me from @TyraBanks !
@BarackObama @BillClinton Please speak out! Every living President , VP, First Lady should speak out against this monster! We are losing our democracy. Please!
you just look around in the usa today and realize maybe just maybe @BarackObama s biggest mistake was that he was black. these racist mofos didnt just wake up yesterday. Especially this one here
Many @FBI are so corrupt. There are I'm sure some that take their position seriously but many under Obama and a couple administrations behind are all under the directions still by @HillaryClinton @BarackObama . Clean house
Political memoirs tend to be self-serving and forgettable, but I just finished @brhodes ' "The World as it Is," about his time working foreign policy for @BarackObama , and it's an engaging and illuminating read.
WHAT?! Please go discuss @BarackObama 's nominee Merrick Garland with @SenateMajLdr . Go do it. Now.
Miss @BarackObama more and more everyday...where is our next Obama going to come from? Hope in the young people who are motivated.
