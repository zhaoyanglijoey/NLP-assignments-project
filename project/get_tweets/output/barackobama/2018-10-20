@realDonaldTrump your party has complete control since 2016 and almost complete control since 2012. You can ram anything thru if your team wanted. But you want to blame because you don't have the votes on your side. Not a real president like @BarackObama
We were so sad to hear the last interview the Late Jamal khashoggi gave to @Newsweek Which was played on @AJEnglish in which he said @BernieSanders the only senator always took strong stance against @AdelAljubeir & @KingSalman brutal regime. He asked where were @BarackObama
@KrisParonto For 13 hrs Americans fought against Terrorists n Benghazi while @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton did nothing. Then with the help of #FakeNewsMedia they lied, attempting to cover up their negligent homicide.Your selective outrage Shaun King is Pathetic. U.S Lives MATTER
Hugs n luvs to @BarackObama & @MichelleObama amazing tweets make me happy thank you for sharing
Hey @BarackObama , @HillaryClinton and @JoeBiden you're in the minor league compared to @realDonaldTrump . May want to work in your libraries instead of embarrassing yourselves. @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump @LadyRedWave @NRA_4ME @dixiefortrump @Patrici15767099 #maga

@TheView @SenSchumer @ananavarro @StephenAtHome @JohnLeguizamo @jesseleesoffer @cnnbrk @MSNBC @maddow : Hey @jimmykimmel , "why when Prez @BarackObama goes to a diner/restaurant to eat, he gets mobbed by fans!? BUT those #CorruptGOP are asked to leave.,
Over 7yrs ago, a nuclear disaster happened that has since been releasing 300,000,000 gallons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. .. And it continues to do so to this day. @BarackObama did his part by raising the minimum safe radiation levels for food/water. #trusthim :(
Blame @BarackObama And the rest of his criminal Enterprise
I care more about a murdered American ambassador and American warriors abandoned by @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton than some reporter with ties to terrorism offed by his own country. #Benghazi Never forget.
So @Scaramucci wrote a book about how @BarackObama was able to get us out of a massive recession and get the economy going again?
@BarackObama thanks
"out of respect" The USA switched sides in the war on terror when @BarackObama was POTUS Do the math #WalkAway

Yemen is the words worsts crisis, Syria and Libya are humanitarian grave yards too. These were all caused by the US & Saudi Arabia and Israel too Not Russia, Putin or Assad @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @SenSherrodBrown @SenWarren
Amazing how worried the #MSM is that @realDonaldTrump might "cover up" the killing of a Saudi Muslim Brotherhood member and Osama bin Laden buddy, but showed no interest when @BarackObama invented lies to cover up the murder of our ambassador and 3 Americans in #Benghazi .
@Barackobama May 10, 1998
@BarackObama is one if the Biggest supporters of terror this century.
The fake smile and the empty rhetoric fooled a lot of people, but now many know what a fraud @BarackObama was.
Well we could look to @BarackObama for leadership hmmm what did he do when thousands of ppl were gassed? Oh yeah drew a line then crossed over it and went golfing

THERE IS NO CRISIS! Gosh, these Republicans make me feel so tired. If they are not crowing about how wonderful everything is (as they benefit from the @BarackObama economy), they are spreading fear and consternation about non-existent threats to keep their base agitated. Sad!

Thought about this sentiment @BarackObama said in Richmond a year ago when campaigning for @GovernorVA , @FairfaxJustin and @MarkHerringVA : "If you have to win a campaign by dividing people, you're not going to be able to govern them." Simple, wise words from a thinking man.
Let's just be honest. The Democrat party of John F. Kennedy is dead. The party of @DianeFeinstein @MaxineWaters @KamalaHarris @NancyPelosi @maziehirono @EricHolder @BarackObama @CoryBooker is the Communist party & #GeorgeSoros is padding their bank accounts. Check their net worth
@shaunking Americans were abandoned by their government that then lied about the incident. Did you condemn @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton ? #Kashoggi was #MuslimBrotherhood supported and no friend of #America . @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr #maga #maga2018 #maga2020
Farrakhan is the liar saying it is okay to kill Jews as if Jews were not human. Farrakhan is Immoral a since he represents muslims, muslims are Immoral. @BarackObama @MichelleObama @POTUS @OfficialCBC @netanyahu @GOP @WhiteHouse
@BarackObama I'm glad I never voted for you, But I did vote for @realDonaldTrump You never thought he would win did you. That's because you have no intuition about much. From the bath houses of Chicago smoking dope, you birthed daughters that now smoke dope. You Failed!!
@BarackObama Sir, thank you for thinking of us with pre-existing conditions. Im disheartened by the number of legislators who are only hopping on the bandwagon because only now someone IN THEIR FAMILY is affected. Zero understanding or empathy or thought prior.

#Trump gave us jobs. Give him time he'll balance the budget. No need to go back to @BarackObama failed policies !!!
what I dont get is what Trump has to do with this guy being killed. It's not like Trump droned him like that supposed terrorist that Obama had executed overseas without any judicial process whatsoever @BarackObama
People don't seem to realize that if @BarackObama did half the things that @realDonaldTrump does there would be riots

Last Saturday, my family, including my two boys, aged 16 & 10, watched 13hrs. The rage I felt after watching it was as raw the day it happened on 9/11/2012. May God grant you all justice soon.. @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton need to answer and face consequences for what they did! pic.twitter.com/oHPo84MdJe
In addition to the many alarms @BarackObama set off when he arrived on the scene, was his deficit in ability to add, subject, multiple & divide. We're certain he hid his schooling transcripts for fear of making public his "F" in mathematics.
@AlexAcaroNY @BarackObama Yes! Tomorrow for @KatieHill4CA #SteveKnightMustGo
That may be true for you but I lost the best insurance a person could have because of @BarackObama .. When your ins premium gores up from $667. a month to over a $1000. per month we can talk

@BarackObama is a has been. Boring and a liar...
@BarackObama sucked for 8 years. And people miss him. WTF. The guy was the worst prez ever.
FACT: #Trump does not want #America to #WIN . FACT: #Trump is against anything hinting of #President @BarackObama ...and, by extension, anything #Democrat . FACT: #Trump 's most obvious #AchilliesHeel is his wallet. Anything impacting his earning potential he will fight against.
This is something "different" perhaps, but @BarackObama and #Bush supported the same "murderers". And murdered 10,000's of thousands of women and children during their Presidencies. ##GeneralDynamics #USA
Really missing @BarackObama today
Ptdr And @BarackObama
Just thinkin bout u, hope ur well @BarackObama

No one can deny the fact that Republicans DID treat President @BarackObama unfairly over the course of 8 years. I defended him on many occasions without regret. I stand here today defending President @realDonaldTrump with zero regret. I WAS a Democrat and that is with much regret
He has the love of the PEOPLE. @realDonaldTrump is THE MOST LOVED PRESIDENT I have ever know of, even @BarackObama was/is not loved as much as our . @Potus is today. March on Sir, you are followed & loved by so many #nobody type people. We support you in all you do.

Why are the Dems "A-Team" hiding? @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden are Missing In Action. This is why the young voters are not in-tune.

I hate the rhetoric in politics today. But in this political climate, The Left has become unhinged. They no longer share Democratic values. We can't play nice with these ppl anymore. I can't believe just 3 years ago I was defending an unfairly treated President @BarackObama
@BarackObama you suck. Worst President ever! Your campaigning does not matter, only helps Republicans
Okay, so where's @BarackObama at? I've been watching nothing but Trump news for the last two weeks and even though @JoeBiden had an event, I have not seen anything about it. This is why the Dems message does not get out. @MSNBC is99.99% Trump news. Where's @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/IuM4Vyjn4Z
@BarackObama murdered dismembered and burned to ash an American citizen on foreign soil with a drone strike. Where was the outrage from @SenatorDurbin @CoryBooker @NancyPelosi @MSNBC @CNN
