#DACA was never a DEALItwasa temporary fix with not chance of citizenship.. @BarackObama said that so cant say its false. It was unconstituationaltodo in first place. However , both parties had years to work on the permanent solution. I support Trump. However this falls congress
@BarackObama Update your bio, you're no longer the president.
#DACA was broken frim the second it was made go watch youtube vids from when your beloved @BarackObama instated it unconstitutionally. It was NEVER meant to be permanent. Was NEVER goingto lead to citizenship! This is not on Trump AT ALL Its congresses job to make law #lawmakers
@BarackObama #NYC misses you so much. Want to tell you I am still thankful for being #44 I hope you are living a blessed life. Wish you could run again #stayblessed
#SuperBowl commercials were better when president @BarackObama was in office
When i hear "president of the united states" @BarackObama Is still in my mind. You rocked!

President Trump just offered the best deal illegals have EVER had.He has offered put 1.8 million a path to citizenship. @BarackObama purposely made #DACA a temporary path to no where, basically a political carrot for the bleeding heart liberal constituents.Irinia open your eyes.
I will agree with you when we see it. As far as I am concerned @realDonaldTrump is a super salesman just like @BarackObama & will not want to, or be able or allowed to work for 100% of people. The only thing that will go up would be stock market to make the rich ridher
I wouldn't say it hammers @BarackObama but it definitely doesn't do him or his former administration any favors. #RealNews #MemoReleased

As everyone including Rep. Nunes has indicated, the memo is not about Mueller's Russia investigation. It is about top FBI officials and top justice department officials under @BarackObama having abused FISA in order to spy on Candidate Trump.

I already conceded that point. It has gone down faster in the past year but @BarackObama did get the ball rolling. Fact is everybody will see more money unless you are a @DNC state that is raping it's citizens on taxes (like my state). We both can provide articles all day long.
What they did to our newly elected President is damn treasonous at the highest level! It also starts at the top.... @BarackObama is the leader #LockThemAllUp
@BarackObama Explain how the $10trillion debt and how it benefits US citizens.....your corrupt legacy has crippled the future of our kids....nice job east side Chicago war zone community organizer

@BarackObama and are you listening to the people demanding that you go to Gitmo?? You are guilty of treason and you are a fraud!
Problem is Bill, OJ was guilty of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, and President Trump is not guilty of collusion with the Russians. Any "glove" that Mueller produces will have @BarackObama 's, @HillaryClinton 's, @EricHolder 's, @AGLynch 's, and @Comey 's DNA on it.

So I don't feel free in the land of the free. You provided it for the American people but it should be my choice whether or not I want to sign up for it without being penalized. @BarackObama
Again, #BLM seeking attention, refuses to see how @BarackObama 's own stupidity led to his being unable to keep campaign promises for "green" transportation, decides to just break the entire system. #SuperBowl

I am pretty sure that some other politician came up with that idea to tax people who don't want to sign up for the healthcare. I like to take care of myself holistically and don't really go to the doctor but I have no other choice but to pay a monthly fee. @BarackObama
Yes, @BarackObama left America a lasting legacy of broken down trains, unverified ids, and now as this story unfolds we see that indifference to his own campaign promises reaping very grim dividends. . @realDonaldTrump . @DonaldJTrumpJr #AmtrakCSXCrash #Amtrak What did Biden say?
Gee, why isn't the Pentagon et al taking away that ability? Mueller, unseal 100+ indictments NOW. Waiting to see what happens risks war @AGSchneiderman @BarackObama @Comey @PreetBharara @HillaryClinton @SenFranken @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @SenBlumenthal
Can you imagine the @seanhannity 's of the world had pres @BarackObama been a wuss and refused an interview with serial sexual predator @BillOReilly when the #superbowl was on @FoxNews like fake tough guy @realDonaldTrump did today with @NBCNews ? Heads would've exploded! #pathetic
I know you have always quoted America land of the free but if you don't sign up for the healthcare you get a penalty. That is not being free. That is an either you sign up or you get penalized so I have no choice. @BarackObama

I really liked you as a President. I also appreciate that you created a program where everyone can get healthcare. The only thing that has me a bit upset is the fact that you implemented a tax penalty if someone doesn't sign up for healthcare. @BarackObama
Did I already share this mess that was dumped in @BarackObama 's lap? There was much more, but those contracts to nowhere ATE all my 401K's while they were shredding or denying our disabilities and PEACEFUL ENJOYMENT for the past 152 years. by OUR watch http://www. accounting-degree.org/scandals/
Please remind us about what @BarackObama did to defeat the opioid crisis. An accompanying chart showing how opioid usage declined 2009-2016 will seal the deal.
It was at risk with @BarackObama @HillaryClinton #LorettaLynch @EricHolder already, so nothing new
Anyone remember when @BarackObama refused the pre #SuperBowl interview because @FoxNews network was televising the game? Neither do I. @POTUS #coward . @POTUS44 #respect
Yeah... @BarackObama built that, you hack!

2) starting to look even more foolish trying to cover up a cover up of a cover up? Wake up...BTW, I have finally located @realDonaldTrump tax returns, they were hidden beneath @BarackObama 's college reecords, passport application, his immigration status as a student, his funding

@realDonaldTrump breaking 14 yr. tradition of pre @SuperBowl interview. Perhaps because @nbc has the game? What a coward. @BarackObama agreed to interview when @FOXTV had the game
@BarackObama just wait.....what goes around, comes back....U and the Clintons are the most deceitful people.....You will be found out one day!
So Jake, you're saying that The Hildabeast, The DNC, FBI, Susan Rice, Loretta Lynch, Sally Yates & DOJ were all in on it and @BarackObama did not approve?

Well, John, your statement conflicts with what Andy testified to under oath to the House Intelligence Committee. So one of you is a liar. Wonder which one it could be? So happy to hear that we now know you implicated @BarackObama in this abuse of power.
You keep "much Russia"ing. You do realize (or are intentionally ignoring the fact) that the Steele dossier, found to be fake, is the only source of the "Russian" connection? #FakeNews #LyingNews . Also @BarackObama will be the first expresident found guilty of #Treason . Enjoy!
@BarackObama Meaning, America was much saver with u bring our president. Amen. U were great, and an awesome communicater. U knew how to govern. This fake one some call president spends time hating on u. He want to be u so bad til he stinks.
Wonder what you @BillOReilly would have had 2 say if @BarackObama would have TUCKED HIS TALE, the way @realDonaldTrump did and skipped the interview with @nbc for halftime of the SB
Casually feeling hella nostalgic watching @BarackObama videos. Thanks for giving so much support to the sciences and the arts.

The bottom line between conservatives and liberals are the work ethic vs the welfare ethic. @realDonaldTrump has shocked the lethargy from the @BarackObama years, remember the free Obama phone #AmericaFirst pays their phone bills.
