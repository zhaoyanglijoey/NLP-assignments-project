I never worried about tomorrow when @BarackObama was President.
Then maybe you should tell @BarackObama and Congress they should not have made a law to separate them in the first place so @realDonaldTrump would not have to waste all this time and resources to unite them back. Or maybe they should not have come to this country ILLEGALLY!!!
Of course he is. @realDonaldTrump is riding @BarackObama coattails.

@GreggJarrett the most ironic part of this Russian Hoax is if Dems get to the point of impeachment of @realDonaldTrump , he could call @HillaryClinton , @BarackObama and many others to testify. This could send many ppl to jail. And Trump would win!

So, to be clear, @BarackObama used American tax-payers' funds to pay Al Quaeda? Do American tax-payers know? What do @USArmy & their families make of this? Is this @HouseDemocrats ' policy? Asking for a friend.

@BarackObama Would love to have you follow me back, sir! :)
#FakeNews . You inherited eight years of steady growth from @BarackObama following the Bush/Republican crash and burn of the economy. And SHRINKING DEFICITS.

While Obama was throwing money away to the axis of evil, @realDonaldTrump is giving it back to those who need it most, Americans. Who's your daddy @BarackObama

@BarackObama knew perfectly well where that money was being funnelled. It's a shame his propagandists at @CNN won't report on this.
WOW! @BarackObama has a message for all the volunteers here at #PowerOfPink18 pic.twitter.com/X6ngtn8akB

@BarackObama So much for a "controlled decline" wouldn't you say Barry?
@BarackObama Maybe you should have asked to borrow Trumps magic wand, then you wouldn't have had the USA borrow money from China. Or been a better POTUS. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He is the real deal!
@trpresidency for the info on @BarackObama being behind the coup, it would be appreciated if you could help facilitate a safe haven for our friend @JuIianAssagne . As well as a backup plan for me in case I need to escape lol. Since @POTUS still hasn't given me a pardon ;) lol! #Q
If I had powers I'll take @BarackObama for President, @BillClinton for Deputy and @43georgebush for opposition leader and kenya is sorted for 20yrs pic.twitter.com/GdURyS0wcV
*Stolen from a miserable Resister* Did I mention @BarackObama in my previous statement.. No! So why deflect to @BarackObama . We were talking about the Liberal Propaganda MSM being fake and reporting with bias and an agenda.. prove to me the MSM is fair n balanced pic.twitter.com/qMCVumGUKA
Paul Krugman is a democratic hack who repeats what he is told to repeat. He was simply trying to legitimize the American economy killing policies of that failure @BarackObama and the soon to be irrelevant @DNC . @realDonaldTrump has made a mockery of him
@BarackObama #ThanksObama
Eat your heart out @BarackObama
Y'all need to check yourselves Oh and Please thank @BarackObama Our last REAL #PresidentObama pic.twitter.com/s1oN8KnHbO
Thank you President @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/FMGM481RAz
Thank you for the strong economy @BarackObama . We miss your attitude, brains and honesty. We appreciate the economy you left behind
Thanks @BevMahone for including me in this tweet. Just seeing President @BarackObama 's face makes me smile. It's raining #catsanddogs here. Thanks for sending a little #Sunshine my way.
See Obummer... President Trump does have a "magic wand"!!!! You said that he didn't know how he was going to do it... when in fact it was you all along that didn't know anything, and how to run a country.... @BarackObama
Yeah, mostly under @BarackObama ! Thanks Obama!
Disrespect @realDonaldTrump says. Them @BarackObama should've banned all governors after this AZ trip. Trump is such a child. Am I the only one that sees when my child does something wrong I feel like he is "Trumping" me. Oh he's 11 FYI pic.twitter.com/gmUEvtTV47

You and your daddy really need to learn some manners ... You could start by thanking @BarackObama Our last REAL #PresidentObama He for this whole thing started pic.twitter.com/UhA4ER6IbR
This is just somehow got else for @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama zealots at least ignore at most call #FakeNews
Thought this guy was pure and chaste with no scandals. What is the world coming to? @BarackObama @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @CNN @foxandfriends @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @therealroseanne @nytimes @nypost pic.twitter.com/ZafFSl3vkc
Did @realDonaldTrump : - sell control of 20% of our Uranium to Russia? - steal $150B Taxpayer Dollars and give it to our mortal enemy, Iran? - give Taxpayer $ to Foreign Nationals to undermine Israel Elections? The answer to all of the above is... " NO..But @BarackObama did! "
What a retard. @BarackObama did 4.9 % in 2014.
@BarackObama There goes Barry trying to take credit for Trump's work!
Thanks @BarackObama
What are you talking about economic turnaround!? You inherited an economy that was doing fabulous thanks to @BarackObama . You've done nothing but manage not to screw it up. #MoronInChief #LiarInChief
I won't tell you what I really think of @BarackObama
Trump touts 4.1 percent growth in US economy in 2nd quarter, largest in years: US economy is growing because of the 8 years hard work by @BarackObama . You haven't done anything to help the economy. Your tax cut for the rich hasn't helped.
Right? They're pretty damned good at timing it so that the next Democrat President has to clean it all up though! Just look at what they left for @BarackObama !! pic.twitter.com/IFE1Tm1pYm
@BarackObama
Hey #TraitorInChief @BarackObama dont make any travel plans anytime soon, you have a nice & comfy jail cell reserved just for you at #Gitmo . I heard the room service is amazing! Enjoy! #LockHimUp #MAGA #DrainTheDeepState #KeepAmericaGreat #WWG1WGA pic.twitter.com/l5eA4DrOYE
2008 almost took down our economy, which the Russians would have loved, but unfortunately for them, we voted for @BarackObama , whose administration competently began to reverse the damage in 2009. By 2010, Russia was actively working to stymie his progress.
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton What a disgrace. Barack and Hillary should be in prison for treason.
Predictable. @BarackObama is so screwed. Lol. #GITMO #DrainTheSwamp #WeThePeople #TheStormIsHere
Besides @realDonaldTrump recognized last time US GDP was above 4 was 2014 Who was @POTUS44 Oh yeah @BarackObama Who was prez when markets were making record gains 4 record months & went from losing 800,000 jobs a month 2 200,000 + jobs ADDED That was #PBO Show some respect Trump
Thank you, President @BarackObama
Just remembered - - @barackobama wiretapped Angela Merkel's phone....I remembered him wiretapping the US Senate Foreign Relations Comte James Rosen & other reporters, but had forgotten about Merkel. Charming wasn't he.
Using your logic she should have been the candidate in 2008 instead of @barackobama . pic.twitter.com/BkZxyAzLZa
No, that honor goes to President @BarackObama YOU came into office on an increasing economy. Your trade war is costing farmers and manufacturing companies billions!! And then there is the issue of minimum wage, which you know nothing about. #TreasonousTrump #LiarInChief
