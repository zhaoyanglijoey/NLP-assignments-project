Just think of the faux-outrage from this current #GOP iteration if @BarackObama couldn't immediately deny the use of the n-word -- they'd be livid and call for his resignation as a lever of partisanship. But, with Trump, many conservatives happily sink even lower.
#TrumpTheLyingKing #TrumpTheFakeNewsFounder #TrumpTheGoldenShowerBoy Did you realize that @BarackObama only sends out a couple tweets a month, but in spite of that, he has twice as many followers as you? I guess the Quality of his Tweets trumps the Quantity of yours.
@realDonaldTrump is not only a racist, he's an opportunist who happens to know how to move the people who hated @BarackObama and diversity. Calling him racist makes him more popular among that group, his base. Unfortunately, this is where we are, I don't want to hear it. VOTE!
Is Obama obliged to pay back the miss used tax dollars or is this going to be excused? @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @RepMattGaetz @RandPaul @newtgingrich @JudgeJeanine @seanhannity @BarackObama
This incivility started with your president. You need to take a look in the mirror and recognize that by backing him up and not holding him accountable, you too are the problem. @BarackObama would never behave the way @realDonaldTrump has.
Ok. I still want updates on Bo and Sunny @BarackObama @MichelleObama Please pic.twitter.com/8mSGyS6hxD
You mean like this one? Obama doesn't look uncomfortable at all does he? Even Alan Dershowitz said if he'd seen this photo of Obama grinning with racist, anti-semite Farrakhan he would not have ever supported @BarackObama for President. pic.twitter.com/tbDFqGdIOi
Maybe @BarackObama should have read the outline. Apparently only our beloved president @realDonaldTrump is the only one who cares about us did.
Thanks, @BarackObama
Another reminder of just how classy & gracious @BarackObama is.
@BarackObama & @HillaryClinton sat in the Situation Room waiting for the word that Bin Laden was captured! John Kelly fired @OMAROSA in the same room. That says all we need to say about who the real @POTUS was! This administration will be remembered harshly.
@WalshFreedom IF what's been done to @realDonaldTrump had been done to Candidate & President @BarackObama we would've had firing squads by now. And you know it, so please stop pontificating on Twitter.
For every single hate tweet we got 5 more American Patriots who are standing by for support of the USA and the President. I stood by @BarackObama and Bill @BillClinton - our freedom happened to @RealAlexJones - we need to get along and respect each other - stop the hatred and WIN

@BarackObama Brought Dignity and Honor to the Oval Office. TWO TERMS ZERO SCANDALS!

Can you believe @BarackObama illegally gave our enemies access to our banking systems? Careful where you point that finger Auntie Maxine
Prison time for @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @BarackObama and about 300 more. #MAGA
Pres. @BarackObama himself has acknowledged that this may have been a tragic error.
for example, today @BarackObama would have stepped into that press room and handled things. Is trump still in NJ?

What? They didnt get any of that $1.7 billion @BarackObama sent over?
Things were better when @BarackObama was are President.
Common sense says so - w/ @BarackObama involvement or @JohnBrennan would have been fired
That's because she wants a "State Run Media" , who in the hell is she to dictate what the press covers? Could you imagine what Foxnews and her father would be doing and saying if President @BarackObama sent out those Tweets that trump sends out and said the same things as trump?

I was so proud that day- Watching @BarackObama watching Aretha and being mesmerized by her. I miss you Barack and I love you Aretha- I love you both so much
. @barackobama caused more #racialdivision than any previous OR present president,
Also fact that, in initial months++, each new admin boasts or bears the consequences of the last. So as @BarackObama inherited the unholy deregulated recession from @43georgebush , so did @realDonaldTrump inherit the gains wrought by Obama's years of recovery work. #conjob @AC360
When @BarackObama was in the @WhiteHouse , white nationalists didn't go anywhere either, writes the American people
@BarackObama is "GUILTY", Period
3) if @realDonaldTrump had the support that was given 2previous presidents including the phony @BarackObama America would be in even better shape. So to the Deep State & all you snowflakes shut the F up & get out of the way so @POTUS can continue making my life better

Not once in eight years when @BarackObama was President was I worried about corruption or any kind of global misstep.
I wonder if I'll see two in my lifetime. I really hope so. I wonder what @BarackObama thinks of the potential candidates for 20/20. What do you think?

@PressSec As per usual, you lied today. You stated that @realDonaldTrump created 700,000 jobs for African Americans, while Pres. Obama only created 195,000. When @BarackObama took over, 15.3 million blacks had jobs, and 18.3 million when he left. That's 3 million jobs! Math fail!

Yeah but @BarackObama messed up by wearing that suit, you know it. They were probably saying he looked like a pimp. He should have been impeached, national security risk. Now in the real world....
@KingJames So Mr. Social justice why are you not in Chicago helping the sad situation that @BarackObama & @MayorEmanuel turn their backs on & where is @Oprah or @ALSHARPTON_REV or @BlackLivesMatte

@SenateMajLdr Blocking hearings just to spite @BarackObama was childish and outright theft of a seat that should have gone to a moderate. The majority of voters did NOT vote for the current administration. No hearings until a winner of the popular vote is in office would be fair.
What would the left do if the leadership of US Miltary Services did to @BarackObama what the FBI/DOJ leadership did to @realDonaldTrump ? This wouldve been considered a coup by Dem's why is this situation any different?
What the hell made you think it was a good idea to type this? You could have just said nothing. @BarackObama never relied on this many insults.

I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying "wake up. There's something I want you to learn. @BarackObama @MichelleObama @successmagazine @YourMoneyAdvice #entrepreneur
@AaronBlake did you write a similar tweet when @BarackObama posed with Jay-Z who shot his brother and stabbed a man in a seperate incident? #DoubleStandard
In these days of uncertainty, here's one thing you can take to the bank: If #JayCarney (press secretary for President @BarackObama ) were asked "Can you guarantee we'll never hear a recorded racial slur from President Obama? His answer would have been "YES" #SarahSlanders says #No pic.twitter.com/aAJ6Uqnr8k

Stole that slogan from @BarackObama .
OK... I am to the point that conversing with you is a total waste of time. @BarackObama was the BIGGEST #liar of a president in my lifetime. Remember, "you like your doctor, you like your plan?" I do and they were total lies! Wake up and smell the coffee!

@BarackObama you belong in Africa.
@potus @BarackObama doesn't mean these are bad people. Remember their real bad dealings was when they worked 4 you.

. @SenateMajLdr Nancy @NancyPelosi was correct, as usual. You clearly demonstrated your racism in the way you treated @BarackObama and disgraced the Kentuckians who put you in office. At this point, anyone who still wears an (R) behind their name announces that they are racist.

@BarackObama is probably the #1 answer.
Hope and change was used first by @BarackObama so you shouldn't use his catchphrase. #ObamaDidItBetter @realDonaldTrump
@BarackObama Just read about how your center in Illinois is going to cost AMERICAN taxpayers $174 million after you promised to build it with private money. If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. You POS. #MAGA #TRUMP2020 #RedWaveRising
Wages have dropped since the #TrumpTaxScam passed. Fewer jobs created over @realDonaldTrump 's first 18 months than @BarackObama 's last. Remember that time Obama paid a porn star before the election and Republicans gave him a Mulligan? Me either. #GOPHypocrites #BlueWave2018
@BarackObama Why does your description say you are President? No other former Prrsident claims to be President. They claim to be FORMER presidents.
@BarackObama I am hoping that a coalition of former Presidents will come forward to denounce all that is happening. It's time.
Thank you @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump should be thanking the hell out of @BarackObama for the work he did as #POTUS
Did @BarackObama lose his card also??
