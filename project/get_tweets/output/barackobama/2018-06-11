I am cancelling @HBO because of their propaganda line up that consists not only of leftist losers like @billmaher and John Oliver @LastWeekTonight but recently they started trying to persuade people with documentaries on traitors @BarackObama and @SenJohnMcCain #SpyGate
Thanks @BarackObama for setting tRUmp up with such a great economy that he could take the credit for it!
When did we know when @BarackObama was lying? His lips were moving.

@BarackObama NEWS FLASH: You are NOT our president!
Thanks to @BarackObama You toddler had zero to do with it.
@FoxNews You are starting to sound more and more like #CNN . I think your audience wants to know about @BarackObama but not the speculation. Why today? Slow news day?
@BarackObama not quite a president no balls
I do admit that how we measure unemployment is a B.S. way to calculate the real #of unemployment. Although I have to say that @BarackObama is the real reason why unemployment rate is down & @realDonaldTrump did jack shit for the unemployed. pic.twitter.com/gGouZAGF3c
@Trumps_Team @FoxNews @charliekirk11 @CNN @MSNBC "Barack Obama is the most dangerous man in the country." ~ My grandfather's thoughts today, among others, when discussing the status quo of today's headlines during my visit at his house today. Your thoughts... @BarackObama
@BarackObama Mr obama, you need to take your Deep State and disappear. Do not hurt Our Country any more than you have already. You are no patriot - just a sad wanna be. I hope they can prove that you are behind the whole false Russia debacle and land your a__ in prison.

@maryannemarsh I find you one of the more reasonable dems, but what was up with your comments on @TheStoryFNC tonight re: Otto Warmbier? That one is TOTALLY on @BarackObama ! Where was HE in bringing this young man home? At least @realDonaldTrump got Otto home BEFORE he died!
Imagine that fake president @BarackObama opened a library, with no records or documents accessible to anyone. He should pay for this monstrosity with his own money, after taxpayers $ he stole are recovered.
The first time today I cried was when I saw a portrait of @BarackObama at the @Newseum
God Bless you all thee could not be a more competent team to handle this issue which @BarackObama said would be @realDonaldTrump biggest challenge.
Thank you @BarackObama . You were/are an amazing president.
@BarackObama Robert De Naro a Dem with a dirty mouth!
@SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr , the fact that you weenies are tying to blame Obama is laughable and shameful! Do you have even an ounce of INTEGRITY. The G6 LOVED and respected @BarackObama . This embarrassment is all on you and the GOP. The fingers are pointed at you. #WTFGOP
Where are @PaulRyanSpeaker @SenateMajLdr & @marcorubio who could not wait to accusing @BarackObama of alienating our Allies and restricting Trade!! Have they all forgotten what they stood for or are they just a bunch sleazy hypocrites scared shitless? @defeat_gop @SenateGOP @GOP
@BarackObama you people are just so sore that are regular visits man can smoke all you guys on the left the best thing you can do is just crawl back in your hole and stay there the country doesn't need you to screw up anything more

@BarackObama took us from the brink of a disastrous economic depression and turned us around with 70plus months of job growth, slashed unemployment, saved auto industry, vastly improved housing market, stock market tripled. Darn those Democrats!
Hahahahaha! You mean like when top conservatives wished / hoped @BarackObama would fail? Now it's different when shoe is on the other foot, the Trump foot. Hypocrite.

I remember how articulately @BarackObama worded his speeches and never blamed a previous administration. Nor did he in any context directly name anyone for the current challenges that would arise. It is always a red flag when a president blames someone else for everything.

He is awful! One of the MSM networks should give @ShepNewsTeam @TheJuanWilliams @marieharf & @JessicaTarlov a show so they can get endlessly opine the virtues of @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama without annoying all of us. #PleaseGod #MAGA

Its funny how the left biased #MSM is casting all kinds of aspersions on #Trump regarding this #summit yet they conveniently forget to mention their messiah, @BarackObama , couldn't get it done. Too bad he couldn't have just issued an executive order or it'd already been be fixed.

fuckhead - thank God @BarackObama rebuilt the economy - the GOP & @realDonaldTrump will fuck it up as usual and you can take that to the bank - they always do.... look at the history
And naturally you want to use that tweet to give some credit to your predecessor @BarackObama who got us back on the path of economic growth. And you want to warn of the dangers of cutting taxes without meaningful spending cuts. Right?

Thankyou @BarackObama
. @BarackObama #DNC As you meet with other Dems two pts re the long term, 1. we're faced with challenges on every front, each uniquely different BUT w/an assuredly common thread, excessive wealth concentrated in too few hands, 33-42% of annual wealth, dependent who did the No's.
Remember when @GOP tried to push a false narrative that @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton were apologizing for America when traveling abroad? Well the time has come where we actually have to apologize. This is NOT who most of us are. I'm sorry how awful things are about to get.
Imagine @BarackObama boasting about all how great the economy was due to his predecessors actions ... lol, because, you'd have to imagine it due to: 1. The Economy sucked at Bush and the @GOP tanked it. 2. Obama isn't a childish braggart like @RealDonaldTrump .
Pay no attention to the #Snowflakes I hope WEAK Liberal Keyian #Muslim @BarackObama & STUPID @JohnKerry are watching how to not give up EVERYTHING to get little or nothing in return like they gave @Iran billions in cash & traded 5 terrorist for 1 deserter.. they were TERRIBLE!!
I keep thinking how @BarackObama would've bowed & scraped, give away the farm, and get another bogus Nobel! Stand tall Mr. President!!
Thanks @BarackObama
@DevalPatrick looks pretty good to me. Hey, @BillClinton practically came out of nowhere to win. This guy seems like someone I could get behind like I did @BarackObama ! #devalpatrick2020 https:// politi.co/2HiWIRW via @politico
@BarackObama understood the effects of the gap and poof, there came ESSA #naeycINST pic.twitter.com/g0VRs3qTau
@BarackObama made it so I CAN NOT get health insurance when @BCBSIL canceled my insurance because THEY wouldn't debit my account on auto pay and its my fault but couldn't take the time to contact me in any way.

Thanks, OBAMA!!! @BarackObama
Thank you @BarackObama
And when we elected @BarackObama we the people spoke elected him to pick Supreme Court justices and @SenMajLdr took that right away from us. Elections matter but so do attacks on democracy.
He probably thinks President @BarackObama signed an EO to make it a law, so he's disassembling it.
You weren't President until January 20th. Stock Market #Tripled over eight Obama years. My retirement will be fine if you are HALF as successful as Obama. Thanks @BarackObama
The @BarackObama curse.
When he threatens them with fire & fury you criticize when he negotiates with them you criticize. One thing is for sure he is a better negotiator than @BarackObama after the terrible #IranDeal .
Thanks, @BarackObama !
Once again, Thank you @BarackObama for all you did. #Imperdible
Don, is this like what you said about @BarackObama speaking to Cubans or Iranians? Curious? Anyone have a tweet? @NBCNews @MSNBC @CNN
Thanks, @BarackObama
Sorry but NK tested themselves out of a nuclear facility. You faulted @BarackObama whose economic coattails you're riding for focusing solely on nukes with Iran. Meanwhile you ignore NK's #HumanRights violations.
@BarackObama met w/9 dem pres candidates at his @World_Wildlife offices HIS ADVISE; KEEP TALKING ABOUT RUSSIAN COLLUSION @BobSMueller tasked with keeping investigation active #SUPRISE @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GOPChairwoman
Hope you understand lagging indicators idiot. Thanks @BarackObama for starting the road to recovery and lettingthe trends do the talking for you. This clown think is all about him. We will see the next 2yrs when this place goes to hell. #resist #DumpTrump .
So, when you undoubtedly went after @BarackObama when he was @POTUS , did that mean you hated America?
I miss @BarackObama 's ability to get things done without bragging.
F**k Robert Dinero F**k @BarackObama F**k @HillaryClinton F**k JamesComey F**k @Cnn Fake News F**k @SenJohnMcCain F**k @BillKristol F**k @RepMaxineWaters
Thanks @BarackObama
Thanks @BarackObama
America is done doing it the liberal pansy way. We finally have a strong leader in @realDonaldTrump that is putting America first and #MAGA @BarackObama was an absolute disaster for the people of this great country.
You know, many people have been comparing @POTUS leadership skills to #OlBigEars @barackobama . It's simple Trump leads from the front, #OlBigEars didn't just lead from behind, he lead WITH HIS BEHIND!!
@AnaKasparian The #RightWing went nuts after @BarackObama had to go show contrition after The Shrub's presidency. Imagine how they are going to react when our next president has to make amends. #TYTLive
It's about time you recognize what President @BarackObama has done for us! Now apologize for the birther movement!
thanks @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/PK3lbqi71t
