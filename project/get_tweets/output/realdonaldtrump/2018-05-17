@realDonaldTrump SO how long are you going to PERMIT Sessions to STONEWALL Congress before you get the balls to FIRE BOTH HIM & ROSENSTEIN! He has DONE NOTHING pertaining to investigating the CORRUPTION WITHIN the DOJ & FBI! WHERE is the INDICTMENT against McCABE????
@realDonaldTrump Can't you raid and crush the media yet, they are unconstitutional at this point. who do they work for Soros? , take him down. " walk softly and carry a big stick " " you are our only hope obi wan"
Mr. @realDonaldTrump , are you talking about about FARMERS or GROWERS? Perhaps you can clarify?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump ANIMALS! I'm sure President Trump would gladly introduce you to the parents whose children were slaughtered by these animals. Nancy, you & your criminal cohorts are a disgrace! #WeThePeople #MAGA #Qanon #WWG1WGA pic.twitter.com/zMUiixxPDb

@realDonaldTrump Gina is not loyal to you. She ran the CIA London Station when they were spying on you and trying to ruin you. VERY bad choice. The Deep State has fooled you again. Sad.
Maybe @realDonaldTrump can get another billion dollar loan from the Chinese too help pay the teachers what they're worth!
@realDonaldTrump just sent another wrongheaded tweet. If I had $1 for every dumb tweet he sent...Oh, wait, I do. #Qapital
Political Correctness is tool of leftists & Statists to get people not to talk or act. @realDonaldTrump is still being influenced by Deep State. They got him to not use his legal power & authority to fire & release documents because of optics while little guys go bankrupt
@realDonaldTrump !!! YOU ARE #HILARIOUS !!! #LOVE IT !!!! "I Hear #Covfefe !!!! " #SO #DO #I !!!! #InTheEndWeWIN !!! #LauralOrYanny ?
So @BarackObama did spy on @realDonaldTrump How about the @JohnBrennan Put that in your pipe and smoke it!

@realDonaldTrump will say something ignant soon, no need to take what he said out of context. Gang members are preying on us, killing, robbing, harming children who want an education. What do we call them? Humans? Yes. Animals? No. #mediaiscomplicit
Hey Dumbalina @realDonaldTrump ! You check this out??? Pretty cool.
@realDonaldTrump Where can I get a MAGA hat, I want one so bad?!? #futurerepublican #Trump #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump is just as ugly on the inside as he is on the outside
That would confuse @realDonaldTrump he would think that you could get HIV from a dog listening to an album.
The @GOP already sold their souls fifty years ago when they realized the only way to get America's dumbest half to keep voting for their own poverty was to sell out to their superstitions and petty hatreds. @realDonaldTrump is just the predictable outcome of their slide.

The "greatest Witch Hunt in American History" has been a real Crucible for @realDonaldTrump .
Waiting for @realDonaldTrump to furiously tweet and denounce Bill Gates as a liar... and 3...2...1....
It is my strong belief that this is exactly what @realDonaldTrump is aiming for with every one of his foreign policy move. He wants chaos, he wants violance, he wants war for financial benifits distraction. If there were an exact opposite of Nobel Peace Prize, he would get it.

I got a theory on what #Qanon is trying to tell us with his latest pics. Bill Gates had a meeting with @realDonaldTrump a while back. Patriots are sure that Bill is a black hat. What if #Trump cut him a deal. Q is telling us there working together on something. Part of the plan.
Incredible! The hypocrisy of these moronic dolts on #CNN #MSNBC saying @realDonaldTrump is overusing MS13 while they eat sleep & get off on everything Trump 24/7! Defending MS13 speaks volumes. Spend a day w/ this heinous gang then voice your opinions. https:// youtu.be/h9mJ_fMJH1k
Sad but true, I'm just now taking the @realDonaldTrump approach...he sits back and watches as the corrupt give themselves enough rope, they all think they are untouchable and so do their unfair practices thinking nothing will happen until they expose themselves for who they are.

@realDonaldTrump has donated his salary each quarter 2 a worthy cause-never reported by the likes of @CNN & @MSNBC etc-just heard @MarkSimoneNY say he knows personally @POTUS has given away $millions over his lifetime-Trump like no other before him-the best& history will show it
. @ScottAdamsSays : Perfect self-deprecating, light hearted, and culturally relevant humor by @realDonaldTrump at the end. https:// youtu.be/1qsRU7C_Gp0
Also there are Mars aliens living in your house. Dumb and blind seem to be prerequisites for @realDonaldTrump followers

@realDonaldTrump wrote Congressman Tim Kaine about Pompeo nomination, said he voted vs it because he thought Pompeo would exacerbate your name calling instead of encouraging diplomacy. I thought he voted vs everything Trump because he was Hillary's running mate & soreloser

Not sure how you arrive at "no collusion" the evidence is mounting and folks are being arrested. @realDonaldTrump is too scared to testify because he knows he cannot maintain all the lies. That says it all right there.
All these "Successes" that @realDonaldTrump claims have me in a dismal quandary. 1 yr in and I find myself in a racist America. I see and hear hate and disrespect daily. I pay more for gas and I fear we are on the verge on war at every given moment. My health care still sucks!
President @RealDonaldTrump is donating his first quarter salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs, press secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday. Trump had committed to donating his $400,000 annual salary to worthy causes. #KAG #Veterans #IStandWithPresidentTrump pic.twitter.com/eK23KKEPMY
