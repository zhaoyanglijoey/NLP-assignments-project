At least he served mr bone spurs @realDonaldTrump
No need to come down on us collectively. There are plenty of us who think @SenCapito and @realDonaldTrump are sacks of shit.
. @realDonaldTrump was publicly laughed at by world leaders at the #UNGA and I am very certain that they laugh at him even harder in private. In other words, thanks to him, the United States is respected less than it was before he got in office. You know I am right.

@JeffFlake said a thorough investigation, so now his #KavanaughVote vote should be NO, @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I was so depressed by the events of this week, as regards Judge Kavanagh. Je is a good man who does not deserve tj8s abuse. It was so good to see you at the WV rally. Gives me hope! Go Marsha Blackburn!
@realDonaldTrump We love Judge Kavanaugh so much it hurts. He was born for the Supreme Court...and believe the lamp unto your feet showed you the way, and helped you make this most decent pick. #Godsend
@realDonaldTrump thinks there's a conspiracy against him.
Another similarity to @realDonaldTrump . His supporters think "he must be smart because he's a billionaire." The problems are: A) He would be a billionaire if he did nothing for 40 years; he inherited $100+ B) It is quite possible he's NOT a billionaire Kavanaugh is Trump
This is my belief. I believe @realDonaldTrump is 10steps ahead of them. pic.twitter.com/gEHbqWBdvq
This guy, Patrick Morrissey ( @MorriseyWV ), seems pretty awesome. West Virginia has a good one there. I'm tired of worrying about people like Flake, Collins, and Murkowski. I need prizefighters like this guy to help @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
At the point you enter certain careers, careers related to children, yes, folks are mandatory reporters. Do not go into a profession that requires you to report abusers of children if folks can't make such a report. @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley
@realDonaldTrump i think it is your good friend Soros starting a bunch of this crap.
. @realDonaldTrump Such a stupid and lackluster rally. And so full of BS lies. Your audience is so, so bored.
Really? Vietnam? Should @realDonaldTrump really go there? I mean, afterall, he, um, didn't go there.

@realDonaldTrump crime doesn't pay no matter what your boss in russia says. eventually the law catches up with criminals like you. you'll be in prison before the end of your first term as a dictator.
Can't believe I just reached 100 followers!! Might not seem like much to most of you, but to me, a loyal @POTUS @realDonaldTrump supporter and believer..this is HUGE!! Keep up the good fight!! Thank you all!! #ComfirmKavanaugh #MAGA #KAG
@realDonaldTrump What are you hiding? What are you afraid of? Now more than ever we know Kavanaugh is guilty and we will forever believe it. November is coming. And we will be coming for you.
Way to being attention to the gang rape allegations @realDonaldTrump !! Genius !!
lol Evan, @realDonaldTrump is not funny. Trump trashes our allies but give praises to Russia and North Korea. Far as paying their fair share, they are paying the amount that Obama agree to, starting in 2020. Trump needs to come down hard on Putin and NK, ijs
@realDonaldTrump What's the scuttlebutt about Safeway employment records of Kavanaugh being "safe." What's going on Donny? Obstruction of FBI again? Geesh! I hope you didn't do it...for nuthin! Could the press have them already? That would look very Bad. Sad
A real man of conviction. You have sold your soul to @realDonaldTrump .
They won't. Are you kidding me. They just blew smoke our skirts. I don't mean @JeffFlake but @realDonaldTrump ,. @ChuckGrassley . @SenateGOP , @LindseyGrahamSC , @tedcruz , @JohnCornyn , @senorrinhatch , @senatormikelee , @SenThomTillis , @SenJohnKennedy , @MikeCrapo .
@realDonaldTrump THRUOUT HISTORY @GOP UNDOES ANY PROGRESS WE'VE MADE & FORCES US TO FIGHT FOR RIGHTS WE'VE ALREADY WON! I'M SICK OF FIGHTING DEGENERATE GOPIGMEN THAT USE THEIR POWER LIKE A WMD AGAINST THE PPL THAT GAVE IT TO THEM! THEY'RE NOT THE OPPOSITION, THEY'RE THE ENEMY!
FBI, please interview Dr Fords Parents, husband, siblings and her Beach People. Also ask for Bank, cell phones, computers and therapist records. @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump @dbongino @FoxNews
. @realDonaldTrump you're convinced that having #Kavanaugh on the SCOTUS will keep your ass out of prison. LOL You dumbfuck. Your ass is going to die in prison.
@MorriseyWV - Excellent job at the rally. West Virginia has always been my favorite state. I wish I lived there. Still - I feel a kinship with every patriot on the @realDonaldTrump Train, and I'm in your corner! @FoxNews
A lot of political capital was well spent on seeding solo to the White House for which the strangest of farmers @realDonaldTrump @MELANIATRUMP get to now harvest but such is Lafayette cursed to span the two nations yet still believe

There's one pt. I haven't seen anyone investigate: Why did CB. Ford wave at Mark Judge at the supermarket knowing he was a witness/participant at the time of the incident? I would venture to say that most victims would avoid them at all cost. . @BrettKavanaugh . @realDonaldTrump
America is winning! #MAGA2020 #KAGA @realDonaldTrump
Governors races will be among the most consequential elections for environmental policy in 2018. Democratic governors will fight @realDonaldTrump 's anti-environment agenda by pushing forward on clean energy solutions and climate action. https:// bit.ly/2OieVqs
Shit like this is why you WILL BE IMPEACHED and the Trump name will eventually be worth nothing. @realDonaldTrump
"A vote for @MorriseyWV is a vote for me". @realDonaldTrump in WEST VA NOW

@realDonaldTrump ...If Saudi takes the $9B out, then the bank paid Saudi. If Saudi re-deposits the $9B again, then the bank owes Saudi $9B again. If Saudi buys tesla for $9B, the bank then owes tesla $9B on deposit. Bank deposits (M2) are a perpetual debt never to be paid....
Have u apologized to the young boys u ignored who was sexually assaulted. Brett Kavanaugh is a SEXUAL PREDATOR. @realDonaldTrump @GOP

Next Thursday, Rochester, Minnesota when @realDonaldTrump endorses @MNJeffJohnson for Governor and others. #HardWorkPaidOff #MAGA #OverThrowTheStatusQuo
This would be a perfect time for @realDonaldTrump to release the names of those in congress who used OUR money to settle $15 million in sexual harassment claims.
@realDonaldTrump hobbled the FBI making it impossible to conduct a real investigation into Kavanaugh just to give @senatemajldr and the rest of the disingenuous republicans cover. This is NOT a search for the TRUTH this is a search for a back alley into the Supreme Court.
Absolutely, they actually listened, it wasn't news or the president addressing the nation it's a hate rally he won't say anything surprising or news worthy just hate oh no and lies you seen what happened when he lies outside of the rallies THEY LAUGH AT HIM @realDonaldTrump

1/2 Let me save you guys the agony of watching Nasty Nixon's (aka, @realDonaldTrump ) #WestVirginia rally. He will discuss: "Crooked, lying media" (might even call out @CNN and @Acosta ); How great #Kavanaugh is; @Sen_JoeManchin agreeing w/Flake; @JeffFlake The "drunk" accusers;
Our free and independent press must step up. Investigative reporting can supplement an FBI being constrained by @realDonaldTrump .
Dicktator Trump. @realDonaldTrump #FuckTrump
#JoesGottaGo seems to be the new WV slogan! Love it! #MAGA #Howaboutdat @realDonaldTrump
Privileged White Democrats push to return to the days when a woman made uncorroborated allegations against a man, and that was enough to lynch him. @FBI @jeffsessions @JeffFlake @ChuckGrassley @senatemajldr @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity @rushlimbaugh

How does saying goes the suit is what makes the man. That's how you know you can't trust @realDonaldTrump how does your tie go all the way down and why is he always wearing red?
Its perfect! Sadly, when you live behind enemy lines (LA SF other CA metro areas) like her, you have to be careful or the Liberal Nazi SS will come after you. CA libs think its A-ok to rip into @realDonaldTrump ENDLESSLY, but God forbid someone makes a joke about one of them

@CNN & @msnbc refuse to show the Trump rally in West Virginia... but they show a precious #president who failed this country and forced Americans on to food stamps more then ever, full time! STAND AGAINST THE LEFT!!! #VOTEGOP #MAGA #KAG @realDonaldTrump Thank you, @FoxNews ! Real
We've turned into a Banana Republic thanks to the orange monkey @realDonaldTrump
Does anyone know if @realDonaldTrump will be rallying in CO?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson Did Feintein's Chinese spy leak Dr. Ford's letter? Hmmmmm.......

Google? You give @realDonaldTrump much more credit than he deserves. He can now consume Sean Hannity through a feeding tube so not only doesn't he have to read, but he doesn't have to sit up & pay attention now either. He does no research or intelligence seeking.
Again Juan....Give us ONE EXAMPLE of @realDonaldTrump decreasing the "Rights" of anyone? I've been waiting a week since your last silly hyperbolic post. You have yet to offer an answer.

It's partly your fault. But yeah your not the only one to blame we can blame your donors you share with the @GOP and we can blame @TomPerez and Of course we can blame the idiot and Chief @realDonaldTrump but hey how about you do something about it and stop helping Trump fund war!
Oh look. @realDonaldTrump holding one of his hate rallies again tonite. After spewing his "I believe in due process" and "presumption of innocence" nonsense about #Kavanaugh his crowd is frothing at the mouth as they robotically do the tired old "lock her up" chant.
@realDonaldTrump funny how you praise when you think it's to your benefit to do so. For months you've been saying the FBI is corrupt and failing. Now, because you're waiting on a favorable outcome suddenly the FBI is really great. Such a bullshitter! pic.twitter.com/c9g6CuyrN8

@realDonaldTrump There are women out there who claim you've sexually assaulted them. I think it's time to open up an investigation on you. @washingtonpost @nytimes have old investigative reports. It's time to unearth and unleash some fury.
Democrats a bit confused? @realDonaldTrump did not withdraw the nomination of @BrettKavanaugh , what to do now, go the scorch the earth route? #ConfirmKavanaughNOW
@realDonaldTrump ... A US bank buys $9 billion of Saudi oil. The bank merely adjusts its ledger to show $9B more in the Saudi bank account. It does not cost the bank anything to adjust its ledger. Saudi sees $9B (USD) more in its bank account and thus believes it was paid....

WHAT A SHOCKER... @realDonaldTrump should have done that on DAY 1. Instead it is last. This is par for the BIGGEST LAUGHINGSTOCK on this planet. As typical, THE CART IS LEADING THE PONY.
Just the fact that you're calling him, of all people, a gentleman says a lot about your disingenuous cluelessness. #tRUMP @realdonaldtRUMP is anything but a gentleman, in every sense of that compound word! That much I do know.
I BELIEVE IN @MichaelAvenatti 2 PUT @realDonaldTrump & ADM ON FULL BLAST. AVENATTI WILL MAKE SURE USA PEOPLE HAVE THE FULL TRUTH & NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. KAVANAUGH WILL HAVE THIS SCANDAL HANGING OVER HIS HEAD IF HE IS SEATED. WE WILL IMPEACH HIM ONCE WE HAVE SUPER MAJORITY.
