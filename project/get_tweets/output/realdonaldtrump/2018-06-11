What a day...just want to say thank you @realDonaldTrump and Q, #Qanon . You give us hope.
That's huge, it true. Though @realDonaldTrump might be deceived in accepting (without a full security detail & air support), it may be a taunt bluff from Kim. Either way, not backing down would solidify Trump's honour/prestige in Korea. #SingaporeSummit
Where the hell are the real conservatives? How dare they do nothing while @realDonaldTrump and his spawn fleece America! @JoeNBC @GOP @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @SteveSchmidtSES @SpeakerRyan
Stop the presses!! "The Missles have stoped." @realDonaldTrump wants the real news reported. Doesn't get any more real than someone who thinks he's a genius and can't even spell. That's our #DotardInChief
There's exactly 0% chance that @realDonaldTrump will come home from Singapore dating he failed. The only way we'll truly know is if NK does a nuclear weapon at us. That would be a clue, otherwise EXPECT LIES AFTER LIES!

@realDonaldTrump Good luck my beautiful POTUS. God bless you. I am praying for you.
Can you dislodge your head out of @realDonaldTrump 's ass, for long enough to interview him?
@realdonaldtrump @MichaelAvenatti @MSNBC @maddow 1-minute man about to meet Rocket Man. @johnpavlovitz #Disgraceful
Vulgar language became acceptable with @realDonaldTrump !
Kim Jong Un is playing #Go while @realDonaldTrump is thumb wrestling.
@realDonaldTrump is taking advice from the Canadian Bacon movie. Pathetic and weak https:// youtu.be/4jf8Bt4gD9Y
@realDonaldTrump this is what the MAJORITY of the WORLD thinks of you!
@realDonaldTrump Is there any way we can shut @Alyssa_Milano up?

Happy Happy Birthday Mr. President @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Most of the jobs are low paying and the workers can't make ends meet with the high cost of living. Most Americans are not confident at all, especially in your abilities to lead. Please resign: @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump 's micropenis and testicles must have fallen off
Trudeau is in Ottawa plucking his eyebrows after the G7 and @realDonaldTrump is in Singapore trying to make the world a safer place.
@realDonaldTrump Cops shoot a guy in Baton Rouge 4 selling cds. he was threatened the whole time by cops saying they will blow his head off. he was shaking in his teeth & then they shot him 5 times. the cop tells him he's a stupid mother f'er after he's already dead.
@realDonaldTrump hey baby hands all the major news channels, even the official TrumpPutin news outlet @FoxNews , are covering Kim Jung Un's motorcade instead of yours. Sad!!
Thanks to the economy @BarackObama handed over to @realDonaldTrump . I am SURE you gave President Obama the credit he deserved for 8 years too, correct?
@realDonaldTrump you are the man! So honored to have you as our President! Dont listen to all the negativity! You are doing a great job!

If @realDonaldTrump put as much effort running this country, as he does ranting on Twitter, he wouldn't be as much of clown @CNN and the like couldn't complain as much, and and I wouldn't have become a @LPNational member.
@realDonaldTrump likes being a puppet..
Is that because you didn't catch the misspelled words? You elected a conman. Everything @realDonaldTrump does he's making sure it benefits him now & when he's kicked out of office. Money from dictators, trump licenses from all over, tax scam bill, deregulations, love 4 Russia.
Is @SteveCortesTX serious? You sound totally deluded right now. @realDonaldTrump is showing signs of dimentia and you think it's really a genius strategy to lull his opponents? @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN #willtheinsanityeverend ?
Local industry , Rio Tinto, Alcoa Aluminum multinationals already benefiting from a.70 dollar and subsidized Hydro rates. No wonder @realDonaldTrump is pissed @Justin
@MSNBC Mueller and Mccabe made deals with Whity Bolger and you only talk about @realDonaldTrump and his deals with NK killer
Except if the doer is an idiot who knows nothing about the things that need to be done. A good example is you & family. The best example of a moron is @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump is a phenomenal developer & builder. He can help rebuild NKO even better than when we rebuilt Japan. This is going to happen & NKO will develop quickly. Kim just needs to keep his nose clean & he will have a partner in USA.
While mowing my yard this afternoon I came to realize that gnats are like democrats, their both worthless, annoying and have NO meaning in life! #MAGA @FoxNews @dbongino @realDonaldTrump
Who is she? @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump will agree to anything that #KimJongUn will propose as long as the @Trump organization gets exclusive rights to build in #NorthKorea , following a negotiation policy known as "We're @Trump , bitch."
#WeThePeople have vote and we have to use real policy talking points and issues to take down @realDonaldTrump , not this immature gutter level mudslinging that he is on. #WeThePeople ARE better than that.
I have a great idea @realDonaldTrump . As a showing of good will, tell rocket man that we will allow his political prisoners to come to the USA, and we'll send Robert De Zero and all those filthy dirtbags that gave him a standing ovation last night at the #TonyAwards to NoKo #MAGA
#QAnon visiting form we have copies for the whole standing ovation at the #TonysAwards #Holliewood @realDonaldTrump for the Win! #NoDeals pic.twitter.com/QPX6uGRPbV
It doesn't matter how @Europarl_EN approach him :) @realDonaldTrump will get his way, regardless :) If only @theresa_may had an ounce of his strength .
Pretty obvious that @CortesSteve has a man crush on @realDonaldTrump ....nothing but verbal diarrhoea coming out of mouth....
What if the @realDonaldTrump embraces this opportunity to correct past US mistakes and agrees to total verifiable denuclearization under the condition of it being global. #InstantWorldHeroes @CNN
@HardballChris : If you give @realDonaldTrump the opportunity, he will behave and be worst than Kim Jong-un.
@realDonaldTrump So
@realDonaldTrump is mistaking scamming to trading. There is no free or fairness in scamming.
Someone wake @realDonaldTrump the meeting is in an hour. Time to start your prep.
@realDonaldTrump God Be with you, @POTUS .
@realDonaldTrump The president is making something happen, something all the nay sayers said would never happen. We are witnessing the eve of a potential new world. Thank you President Trump pic.twitter.com/j4vjtalgPR
The Dotard vs Little Rocket Man. My money is on @realDonaldTrump #SingaporeSummit #Potus #TrumpKimSummit #Winning #nonukes #Peace #maga #ArtOfTheDeal
...totally in response to the vulgar new normal in political discourse (let alone foreign and media relations) that was initiated by @realDonaldTrump
I'm suspicious, but hopeful. Did you stop drinking @realDonaldTrump 's kool-aid?
@FoxNews @OryBri @WayBack789 @realDonaldTrump why does @FoxNews even bother with Chris Wallace? Just a negative Nancy on everything Trump #86 him
Fu*k @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump What does stoped mean?
@realDonaldTrump In A Little Over One Hr. Trump / Kim Summit will Start! In A Little Over One Hr. & One Minute The USA And World Will Find Out If The Meeting Was Good Or Bad! (Why is there a feeling of just putting a Once-N-A-Lifetime Bet at the Belmont Stakes 2018 Horse Race?)
@CortesSteve you jerk! @realDonaldTrump is NOT a self made billionaire! That was his daddy's money! #Trump is crap! He's going to screw this up in #60seconds #SqueezetheCharman
They say they are our friends and allies. All @realDonaldTrump does is to tell the truth! We have been suckers through past administrations. Thank God for Trump!
Make sure u're not using local,state elements of #florida to harass,bully or preclude me or any aspects of my life including 'employment' &don't deputize,ennoble/lionize people or work place to do anyone's dastardly deeds or demonizing me @PamBondi @govrickscott @realdonaldtrump

Robert De Niro, you are delusional. America has spoken, we voted for @realDonaldTrump because we are not sheep who blindly follow uninformed people like you! My paychecks have never been larger & smile has never been bigger! Thank you, POTUS!

Ruthless dicktators like KJU, Putin, Duterte, Hitler, etc., are the Feckless Feces in Chief's ( @realDonaldTrump ) heroes. I have no doubt you're damn right he'd institute concentration camps if he thought he'd get away with it. Complete w/gas chambers.
Praying for President Trump tonight. @realDonaldTrump
Praying For Our President Tonight, For His Safety & His Success at This Historic US/NK Summit. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #TrumpKimSummit #SingaporeSummit
It is so awesome that @realDonaldTrump lives in Jennifer's head totally rent free. I mean here he is doing something that no other American President has been able to do with North Korea and she is bringing him up in a discussion about a chicken sandwich joint. Now do #IHOb
And @CNN has fingers crossed that it goes poorly and that @realDonaldTrump fails.
Every temporary worker is a potential immigrant. We must plug this loophole asap. @JxhnBinder @realDonaldTrump @4US_Workers @TomCottonAR

I would LOVE to see @dennisrodman walk in with @seungminkim and her brother @KimJongUn I bet @realDonaldTrump would shit ALL over himself....
@realDonaldTrump LORD JESUS BLESS YOU, I M PRAYING FOR YOUR SUCCESS.
I'm going to be tweeting the developments of the #SingaporeSummit with President @realDonaldTrump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un live - Retweet and follow for updates. (Starts in approximately 1 hour) HISTORIC OCCASION! pic.twitter.com/2lqoWXzjBw
@realDonaldTrump is still coming to terms with the fact that Merkel, Macron and Trudeau are leading the free world. #FakePresident can go form his own trade group with Russia.
LOL.... since the beginning of the election you couldn't see how @realDonaldTrump could become @POTUS & all your scary hateful predictions ended up wrong. Clueless may be a good place to start with understanding why your news lost 30% of viewers too. Stop the Fake Hate. ;-)

Greatest president ever. @realDonaldTrump
@chelseahandler @realDonaldTrump is still @POTUS .
He gave racists a voice @realDonaldTrump
@JustinTrudeau Did not back stab or anything remotely close to that, simply stated Canada would not be pushed around, as he should! @realDonaldTrump acted his usual crazy & then had top aides run out into the media to make up false stories to try & justify the mess he created.
@realDonaldTrump Give 'em hell Mr. President! #EyeoftheTiger P.S. Wilbur gotta go.
We have your back, @realDonaldTrump !!! Glued to the tv watching the coverage on this meeting. You are MY President!!
@BetsyDevos @realDonaldTrump DID YOU KNOW THIS? Our 4th grade students just graduated 2 the 5th grade--but guess what?They can't read CURSIVE writing OR WRITE IT.They can only print.Our original Constitution was written N CURSIVE.Therefore,they can not read a copy of the original
Who here is excited for 9:00 p.m? I have been waiting all day to hear our great . @realDonaldTrump announce that the negotiations with KJU went well and peace is just around the corner for all concerned?
That's what @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan wanted. This is for the 1%, Corporations and lobbyists
@realDonaldTrump #POSUS Says he will know within a minute whether the meeting with Kim Jung Un will be productive or not. That's why he has been in over 3000 lawsuits.
. @realDonaldTrump thinks he can sum Kim Jong Un in 60 seconds? He is a complete douche. The talking head on @CNN (a trump person) is a fucking idiot. #OttoWarmbier was tortured and died. Really? Do we think #KimJongUn is going to change? #JusticeforOtto #NorthKoreaSummit
You got your Chinese trademarks, Ivanka. Now STFU! @realdonaldtrump #Ivanka #corruptioningovernment
Dude on #CNN just called @realDonaldTrump a genius. I don't think genius means what he thinks it means.
More like his G7 (soon to be 6) Trudeau remarks 2 distract media so he could land huge bizness deal in Singapore. Kim looks at tourist traps while @realDonaldTrump ... #SentosaMimosa
