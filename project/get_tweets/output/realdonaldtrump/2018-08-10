Speaking of the media giving someone a platform... I recall every fucking network giving @realDonaldTrump free airtime every time he said or did something stupid and then brought his shills on the Sunday shows to talk about him ad nauseum ffs. We see you MSM @chucktodd
@SteveKornacki not be surprised @realDonaldTrump uses presidency for his benefit it is ok if his Slove in laws come as chain but not others also your guest is right Trump supporters are so illiterate they do not know much but majority of Americans are smart and will vote him out
. Liberals assault & threaten assassination of @realDonaldTrump @potus and his family on a daily basis. What have you losers done about it? I'll tell you... nothing, that's what you've done...NOTHING!
@FLOTUS Now that your parents are US Citiizens via and because of your Citizenship, do you and your husband @POTUS @realDonaldTrump , @HouseGOP , @SenateGOP and the @GOP folliwers feel differently about the issue of chain migration? @CNN @MSNBC @nytimes @Lawrence @maddow @donlemon
@realDonaldTrump How's that #ChainMigration working out for the 1st gal pals parents? #DoubleStandard
@realDonaldTrump loves ALL AMERICANS!!! And he is keeping America safe by deporting illegals!!! Hint: "That's not racist.
@realDonaldTrump is willing to prove over and over again that he is an idiot who literally does not have the mental capacity to understand things that are explained to him. Athletes kneel because black Americans are being treated unfairly by our legal system. End of story.
@realdonaldtrump apparently #ChainMigration is only "a disaster for this country" (your words) when you are brown skinned.
If you support a racist, you are a racist, fuck @realDonaldTrump
Again these fires in California: faster and hotter, more devastating than ever: #Geoengineering @realDonaldTrump @jerome_corsi https:// youtu.be/5mepGXN8Uf0
Much of the US - Mexico border lands are in private hands. There will be hundreds of eminent domain court cases in order to seize the lands needed for the border Wall. These will take a decade at least. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump right! See what Kanye has to say! NADA
I hope we can work together with Mexico. Nice job! Keep it up. @realDonaldTrump
Funny how you get visions on election years, hype at best!! You have been the 100 years, why is this still a problem? #maga @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump is a coward & we are now witnessing his "crisis" skills-- hiding in one of his resorts & pulling the "lid" down over himself. Rather like a toddler hiding in bed with the covers over his head. Guess we will see him when he thinks the coast is clear. Incompetent
Let's make our Great comments here .....! @POTUS your the best! We have long awaited for you. Been since late 1800's that things went bad! We chose you though, now let's finish this disaster and Keep America Great for all Americans @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump ////for those lakes to be used for Industry. Period! We have Geo-fuels we can use with the Hemp Industry. What is happening is these Jerks like the Rothschild's who bailed you out once are Creating a way to control us literally to death & you are not stopping it.

Thanks is honestly too funny for words. Mexico is BAD build a wall!! No wait, the deal is coming along nicely. Canada is BAD! Tax them! Who can keep up? Pick a fucking lane @realDonaldTrump
AND if @realDonaldTrump were to stop short @seanhannity would get a broken nose!
Although @realDonaldTrump probably pictures himself as Luke Skywalker or James T. Kirk with the #SpaceForce distraction, its probably more like: #SpaceFarce #DarthTrumpian #Ferengi #ImAMog pic.twitter.com/5adXFENFSt
Asbestos is an equal opportunity KILLER! @realDonaldTrump is brazenly allowing this proven carcinogen back into the USA Bcs he has ties to the Russian maker! #ImpeachPsychoRacistTraitorTrump #EnoughOfTrumpMadness #VoteBlue2018
When the dummy in Chief @realDonaldTrump be talking that Space Force talk....these images come to mind. pic.twitter.com/t66bs5UKPY
@realDonaldTrump you must be very proud.

Hey, when @realDonaldTrump finally get's booted let's all synchronize a kneel. #resistance
Hey, @realdonaldtrump . Maybe take a look at these numbers before bragging about low #Black unemployment. https:// rewirenews.link/2scqq5T
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS A year and a half and staggering the corruption exposed in the WH and in GOP with @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr at helm and putting party & selves above country.
Colour me cynical, but why would anyone believe a word that comes out of @realDonaldTrump 's mouth at this point? He's a pathological liar and thrown almost every ally dumb enough to trust him under the bus once it suited him. If you believe or trust #Trump , you chose your fate.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I would encourage Americans to go to Canadian Football games and boycott the NFL! If NFL players refuse to stand for the Anthem in this country which has given us all so much. If I were you, I would have the stadiums bought to keep from playing.
The Russia story is a farce. The true meddlers r being protected. We know @GenFlynn trusted so much FBI to do an honest job, he met w/ them w/o an attorney bcs he had done nothing wrong, #Strozk said he DID NOT lie. They seek a chance to do same to @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Pres, you gotta declass all the documents so the country can get to the bottom of this mess. Also fire Sessions, Rosenstein , and Wray. The press is going to be neg, but so what? They are neg if you happen to sneeze!!
This is useless unless we get 2nd special counsel. Jeff Sessions needs to be fired! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS you are also a con artist! Still making billions of dollars from your business and golf courses while being president, be scam ever to the country.
@realDonaldTrump makes a fortune telling lies.
@realDonaldTrump we thew people cant wait to c you get empeached nows the time
@realDonaldTrump Thanks to @EmmanuelMacron and the #French people for being such "Great" friends and allies of you and the #American people. Prayers you, @FLOTUS @tim_cook and #MrsCook have a successful dinner meeting...God bless! #USA #France #Friends #Allies @Apple
Funny, they said the same thing before @realDonaldTrump won and look what happened:O
@realDonaldTrump is "Mister Failure", no surprise.
@realDonaldTrump has no shame. pic.twitter.com/g01wK5skjp
@realdonaldtrump is winning again! China's communist leaders reportedly starting to buckle under pressure of Trump's trade war https:// read.bi/2nqJoU8 via @businessinsider
@realDonaldTrump I and millions of others wrote a blank check on our lives when we joined the armed svcs. We may not agree w/it - BUT ITS THEIR RIGHT! What is outrageous is you acting like a 12 y/o girl and not our potus. Grow up or GTFO!
I loathe and despise @realDonaldTrump his cronies & everyone else who stand by quietly while families are destroyed & innocents are doomed to a life of psychological torment. I take solace knowing there's a special place in Hell for people who hurt children. @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump
Let me be very clear, I don't want to confuse you. Racists are morally inferior and there is no spot for them with true Conservatives and @realDonaldTrump supporters.
@marcorubio @RosLehtinen @realDonaldTrump
Thank you @realDonaldTrump aka #hitlertrump

@realDonaldTrump please go rally in Hawaii, they need to turn the state around. I have very many Republican friends there that would be grateful!!
The idea that disliking @realDonaldTrump is disliking #America is frighteningly offensive. Ms. Frugier is expressing her love of America by opposing the increasingly autocratic rule of #Potus45 . Maybe you're the one that should leave--and not for France. Try Russia.
Kanye is stepping up. I feel like for the first time in my life that the black race actually has a chance to brighten their futures with the help of people like @realDonaldTrump - @kanyewest - @RealCandaceO - @charliekirk11
The #EvilGOP and #BenedictDonald ARE HORRIFIED OF YOU! Why else do they LOBBY so hard for your removal? #ImpeachTrump #PutinsBitch #RussianPuppet #AmericanTrailtor @realdonaldtrump

I'm tired of #CNN interviewing #ParisDennard please stop bring this idiot and butt kissing of @realDonaldTrump . when you refuse to deny racist rhetoric tone set by 45. Really!! There were good people on both sides is what he said.
