@SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP ... @realDonaldTrump ran on "America 1st". Is taking away Healthcare, Medicare, FOOD, CLEAN WATER, Social Security, etc from the American people that paid into many programs, REALLY putting America 1st? We think NOT! American's last.
Impeach Trump from office & you remove a major threat. Act now before @realDonaldTrump & WH staff with no clearance can potentially leak national secrets -particularly given his liaising with criminals & criminal activities thus far in the WH. #TrumpResign #ItStopsNow
If there is corruption with the #FoodStamps program just Imaging how exponentially will grow with the @realDonaldTrump administration proposed #FoodBags eg. #Venezuela 's #Clap ; @maibortpetit @jammastergirish @kejalvyas

@realDonaldTrump @VP @KellyannePolls @seanhannity @GreggJarrett @IngrahamAngle ONLY Congress can make laws Obama made DACA an ACT an illegal one at that so NO judge can make it law Fire any judge who tries
@realDonaldTrump why gas price so highh? U need to cut ittt
@realDonaldTrump @SecretarySonny the proposed $17 billion and $213 billion savings from the SNAP budget is money lost from hard working retailers.
Does anyone remember the movie, "The Super" from 1991? Joe Pesci is a slumlord & has to live in one of his dilapidated rental properties? I think something similar is needed for @MickMulvaneyOMB @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan because of their war on the poor, disabled, & elderly.
JUST IN: Judge grants second nationwide injunction preventing @POTUS administration from rescinding DACA program as lawsuits proceed. - It's time @realDonaldTrump replaces some of these judges. I have never known any @POTUS having so much trouble doing his job.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS
It is very telling how out of touch @@POTUS @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump are with America. And how they truly do not care. And yes @MELANIATRUMP I am talking about you too.

@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @cnnbrk Now that Hillary has apologized for not firing her staffer after ignoring sexual misconduct allegations, where is her apologies for her husband rape cases, or sexual misconduct cases? #MeToo #HillaryClinton #BillClinton
https:// youtu.be/Tr7LbAtVFBg @POTUS @realDonaldTrump here. I think some Dems need to watch this. #dtmag
Every Election @gop and @HouseGOP @SenateGOP ran on #NationalSecurity . They even went after @HillaryClinton based on #NationalSecurity . Her emails went on for years because of NS. Now @realDonaldTrump is allowing criminals 2 c #ClassifiedInfo and again @gop sshh WTF is going on?
What does @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP have against the American People?
That's what upsets me about Jeff Sessions. He should be protecting @realDonaldTrump and do his bidding. Maybe he's doing Trump's bidding behind closed doors but I haven't seen him even working on starting a special counsel yet.
Sen Grassley @ChuckGrassley Amer. workers are still be replaced by H-1b/L-1b/OPT visa holders.Don't believe the hype from Immivoice. They just want green cards for all our TRAINEES I know it VERY WELL, I was ordered to TRAIN my Foreign Replacmnts. @realDonaldTrump @Dawnnewyorker
2.6mil wasted on chimpanzees that were previously used for bio medical testing! CUT THIS INSTEAD! @realDonaldTrump
Why does there have to be a right and wrong way to prepare #steak ? Why can't a person like a well-done steak with ketchup and not be an ignoramus? Speaking for @realdonaldtrump and the average #blackAmerican .
@realDonaldTrump don't take away our food stamps. as a kid with a single mom who couldn't find work when she was going back to school, we relied heavily on food stamps and couldn't have made it without them. don't fucking take that away from another kid.

Hopefully when the Inspector General gives his report it will expose those who are corrupt so @realDonaldTrump can fire the jokers and give the DOJ and FBI a fresh start with people of integrity.
It's always encouraging for politicians when the President, @realDonaldTrump , and @GOP put in bribes for them to vote how they'd prefer. @BobCorker #CorkerKickback #TennesseeIsTurningBlue
