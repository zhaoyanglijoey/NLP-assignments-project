Actually, @realDonaldTrump comes to mind. He used the epithet to describe Sally Yates. and the twitterers is now bubbling with other instances. And, of course, he boasted of his habit of grabbing women by the actual genitals, so...What were you saying?
@realDonaldTrump Yes Sir Running it like a Boss! pic.twitter.com/NYfPu7jOgs
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec gonna need an apology for this too pic.twitter.com/Xi6DCwF50p
@realDonaldTrump is pardoning people who will pardon him after the Muller investigation @TheDailyShow @AC360
If @realDonaldTrump took the SAT tomorrow what would he get on the verbal portion? #illiterate

Find out when @realDonaldTrump is going to apologize to Senator McCain and his family for vile remarks made by both the president and his staff, and get back to us.
@realDonaldTrump If you want Mexico to pay for the wall and force more free & fair trade? All the billions of dollars in remittances to Mexico need to have a 35% transfer tax and be verified that legal residents are sending it. Aliens should have the funds seized. @TomiLahren

What more could Putin have asked of his puppet, @realDonaldTrump ? Have any "active measures" had a higher return on investment than Putin's intervention in our 2016 election? Trump is dismantling the foundations of US & Western strength. They must be celebrating in the Kremlin. pic.twitter.com/LXYM8O1IzZ
So @realDonaldTrump has imposed #steel and #aluminum tariffs on Canada, The European Union and Mexico effective at 12:00am. Expect Retaliation! Hopefully targeting Trump states & voters!!! #KentuckyBourbon #Ohio #TradeWar
@realDonaldTrump I looked up feckless, yes that's Ivanka, the cunt goes without saying
@realDonaldTrump Having a whordashian in the White House is disgusting . She is worthless, has done nothing to better society . The whole whordashian family is bottom feeders . You lost a lot of points allowing that
@realDonaldTrump LYING yet again about 'crowd size' at his Nashville rally recently. Trump says 12,000 ppl were seated, 'there are 12,000 seats, we had 12,000 ppl there". "Tht venue MAX's out at roughly 9,000" says fire marshal. Officials say roughly 5,000 ppl shwd-up, NOT 12,000
The ONLY thing the #RACIST White House objected to was the word #feckless . @iamsambee is right; just like @michelleisawolf was right. @IvankaTrump is a #FecklessC **t She knows it & @realDonaldTrump knows it.
Nope truth hurts, McCain whether he is sick or not needs to face fact. That is why we voted for @realDonaldTrump he calls it like it is no sugar coating
This is what liberals in the "media" do to those who support @realDonaldTrump These people are sick! Truly sick! @POTUS @seanhannity #GreatAwakening #QAnon pic.twitter.com/YVZ0zDgMy6
Wait. Is @Blikemike2 really @realDonaldTrump ?? "Crookery" Clinton? Seems a plausible Trump spelling error. And, still talking about Hillary Clinton? I'm really thinking I'm right on this.
I try to call @realDonaldTrump a twat everyday .
@mflynnJR @GenFlynn THIS THREAD of Tracy's IS mindblowing! @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
Supposed conservative angry at @realDonaldTrump imposing tariffs on socialist Europe and Canada should remember that the unfair advantage we gave them in trade is used to fund their anti-American Marxism. Now they'll need to embrace free markets.
Trump spends that much in a month in his golf outings and the cost of AF1. Benghazi cost us 8 M and no indictments. Mueller has gotten plenty of results. I gladly pay for the Mueller investigation to get to the truth about @realDonaldTrump
We are watching a movie. What are they playing at? Believe Gowdy is a good guy. What is the plan for him? Why the need for him to appear at odds? Think the America First people in Congress now control the narrative. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Good Job! Personal income and spending is up, the GDP has grown, strengthening the economy and the USD. I vote to increase steel and aluminum EU exports taxes and car import taxes as well. Nonfarm payroll have also gone from 164K to 188K, again strengthening USD
I don't get why all these celebs are say #sorry ( #apology ) on what they say everyday. Its who they are, why hide it to make a soft one happy? I mean has nobody ever been called a name? #getoverit BUT if everyone wants to lose their marbles start focusing on @realDonaldTrump
I for one am very tired of the double standard! How is it ok that @realDonaldTrump can say and do much much worse to women and no one cares..but someone calls Ivanka a bad name and everyone is up in arms. If you are pissed about Ivanka you should be pissed about the others
Dear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump , will you tweet later tonight or tomorrow that you will go after Amazon $ AMZN ?Thanks, sir. P.S. great job on the tariffs and start the trade war with our allies, sir.
I hope all these countries take their revenge on @realDonaldTrump
Thank you, @IvankaTrump , for all you are doing to help your father and his administration to #MAGA ! You are very much appreciated by many, many Americans! @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/AduO2CQ358
Nothing like fun, celebrating murders of students while collecting cash from alt-right and #Russia -tainted @NRA . Welcome to #Texas , where cowards of sleazy @GOP @JohnCornyn @tedcruz sit in silence as @realDonaldTrump and greedy crime family sell US out to highest foreign bidder.

Wait...what? @SpeakerRyan disagrees w the great white hope @realDonaldTrump ? Wow
Thank you @nikkihaley @realDonaldTrump for this most important step! Why pay to protect both sides of the battlefield when one side uses every tactic, the worst is using their young children as bulletproof coverage then cries wolf to MSM & the jihadi UN!
Well, he is a "man" that @realDonaldTrump wishes he could be.
@realDonaldTrump how are the Russian sanctions coming along?
@realDonaldTrump Please commute the sentence of Rod Blagojevich. He has more than paid for what he did as governor of Illinois. He acted no different than most politicians. He has served enough time.
@realDonaldTrump 20 days into America's growing fear for the first lady is a terrible time to pardon a wife beater.
WOW. @MZHemingway is a "Man" among boys on @BretBaier tonight. Smart, insightful, accurate display of current events. I went back & watched @realDonaldTrump /Holt interview, So clear when you watch the whole interview. Also, right on point with @TGowdySC . pic.twitter.com/SckHvQ9jEd

@eddie_leonte @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump That's the top tier I'm afraid.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecretService thought any form of assault, assassination, threat to my #PresidentTrump is a #crime #wtf and @therealroseanne makes one comment and she is chastised! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump I wish we could talk on the phone together about certain issues. If you cannot, Direct Messaging would be acceptable. #POTUS #Covfefe #Qannon
@realDonaldTrump thanks, jackass
@realDonaldTrump You are a liar. A sad, pathetic, racist, liar. pic.twitter.com/4zqLZsCW6a
@realDonaldTrump has zero leverage he cancel the summit and then renegotiated with himself for a better deal and is trying to breathe life into a dead horse.
Glad to hear you FINALLY agree with us about @realDonaldTrump
@CNN @ErinBurnett @realDonaldTrump is a coward & racist & doesn't know how to say SORRY, very sad to have a President like him
@realDonaldTrump your such an idiot. Do you ever just listen to the redicilious crap that comes out of your mouth. OMG I can just imagine what these other world leaders think when they are sitting next to you in the White House and you start rambling on about absolute nonsense.
Hey Trump fans! You're offended by what Samantha Bee said? - Democratic Underground https://www. democraticunderground.com/100210679478 @realDonaldTrump @VP @IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse @FoxNews
@CNN @realDonaldTrump @latimesnational @nytimes I agree with the people here in Costa Rica feel that people like Samantha should be put in jail if you say something as bad as Samantha Dan
The @WhiteHouse , @PressSec , and dorky @realDonaldTrump LIE. A lot. Like always.
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BetteMidler @ScottNevins - Melania this tweet is more like it pic.twitter.com/GLbSd7Zxfs
Someone tweeted how the 3 convicts @realDonaldTrump pardoned & possible convicts were prosecuted by the nemeses of #Trump .
Liar in Chief ---> @realDonaldTrump
It is pretty funny. If you don't like it why is your #TrumpCrimeFamily working so hard on making @realDonaldTrump a #Dictator with the help of the corrupt @GOP ?
Children are being separated from their parents & put in detention by @realDonaldTrump 's cruel policies. Join @VotoLatino at a non-violent National Day of Action for Children event near you. #FamiliesBelongTogether Take action http:// bit.ly/2L8zjVW

@realDonaldTrump Some swamp dweller rhinos are going home. Dowdy, Ryan were never for everyday Americans. If they were they would share and laud your wonderful success. Wins all over the place. See the rhinos only work as losers. Pathetic Losers working for their owners.
@realDonaldTrump good trump got in office lives immediately and drastically changed for better or worse make America great again is working we as in u.s needs to work within the agenda as more americans indulge in greatness in prosperity our county has allowed the society growth
Decoding @realDonaldTrump Speak: "Did you know" = I just found this out. "People are saying" = I am making this up right now. "We will see what happens" = I have no idea what is happening. "Fake news" = Information that makes me look bad. "Believe me" = I am lying" - Andrew Skegg pic.twitter.com/HKMdXoSTMn
I bet if there was a law passed that did not allow @realDonaldTrump to pardon anyone connected with the investigation related to trump, his campaign or the Russian interference, you would hear more squealing than a pig farm with fresh slop.
What I don't understand is why no one mentioning the reference to incest but rather with the greater focus on the vile c word. This is not the first time this has been inferred with President @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump . That is so sick and wrong!!
So has the @realDonaldTrump unblocked anyone yet?
If you support @realDonaldTrump ,who "grabs em by the pussy",thinks @megynkelly is "bleeding from wherever",and says @morningmika went to his party "bleeding badly from a facelift",you can't cry wolf when you get a taste of your own medicine. #snowflake #SamathaBee #IvankaTrump
"Make America great again?" Oh, pul--eeze. Get real, @realDonaldTrump ... more like "Dumb Asses unite ... for ME ME ME" #TheResistance #Trump #RoseanneIsAnAsshole #FBRParty #FBR
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for giving Dinesh D'Souza a full pardon today. He is an innocent man who was mistreated for political reasons. Thanks and God bless.
@realDonaldTrump We need more competition in the Automotive and Transportation industry. Ford, Chevy, and Chrystler are old news. Time for newer, smaller, and better American Automobile manufacturers to emerge. Please fund my Automotive company.
this WH can spin it any way they want but blood on the hands of @realDonaldTrump and @Brock_Fema - they are responsible for the deaths in Puerto Rico

@marthamaccallum @LisaMarieBoothe @Richardafowler What Samantha Bee said about Ivanka is proof that there's a Mental Health Crisis coming after 8 years of @realDonaldTrump . Trump Derangement Syndrome is a real psychiatric condition. It's only going to get worse guys. #TheStory
@realDonaldTrump well Mr.President your doing a good job. We the People thank you very much and i am looking forward to your reelection . thank you form an old Marine
@RudyGiuliani & @realDonaldTrump are attempting 2 muddy the waters by giving conflicting reasons 4 the #comeyfiring so that doubt can be put on the #RussianCollusion & #conspiracy that #Trump indicated were the reasons he fired #Comey the day afterward. #ObstructionOfJustice
@realDonaldTrump Instead if complaining about your problems how about helping your citizens by doing something about the ridiculous oil and gas prices. The oil industry made billions of dollars last year and it hurts the middle and lower class citizens. Help us please!
Not sure how this tweet helps bring people together. I get it you don't like @RealDonaldTrump . Call him out on issues. Offer solutions. He allows celebrities in to see him, I'm sure he would see you too. But encouraging name calling...where does that get anyone?
We the people despise you @realDonaldTrump con and liar
The party of family values @realDonaldTrump
He is more of a blowhard carnival barker then our lyin Pres @realDonaldTrump
More proof that @realDonaldTrump is a TOTAL MORON...

@realDonaldTrump claims the Obama controlled FBI prosecuted people for political purpose while at the same time, his FBI is investigating him for treason.
No. Big miss. You owe an apology directly to @realDonaldTrump and then a thank you for the UGE TRUMP TAX CUT! Not watching anymore.
@realDonaldTrump on the subject of pardons- Martha? Yes! Blagojevich? NO! Thanks for the pardon for D'Souza, though.
How much has @realDonaldTrump 's golf trips cost taxpayers @FoxNews ?
IMHO, I really think Rudy Giuliani has been sitting in a dark room, rocking back and forth, & talking to himself since @realDonaldTrump dangled Secretary of State in front of him like the @StateFarm Fisherman. The call to be counsel has seen him emerge from his lair like Gollum.
