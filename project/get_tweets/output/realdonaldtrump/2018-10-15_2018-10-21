@realDonaldTrump seeing as Warren is 1/1024 of a native american. Can you please pay 1/1024th of your promised donation to charity. It's only fair.
Thanks Joe but if you want even more racism got @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls or Donald Trump Jr. Then tune into his rally tonight
Gee, I wonder how he might have figured it out? Looked at history? Actually @stevenmnuchin1 knew it beforehand and just lied because @realDonaldTrump told him to.
Meanwhile, real Native Americans are furious.I spent some time reading some responses, they are very upset. She needs to stop with this lie and apologize to them. Shame on you @SenWarren . @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump you said that you'd pay a million dollars to charity of Senator Warren did a DNA test and prove she was Native American. Now you're trying to back away from your own words. Odd coming from the same guy who sued Bill Maher for questioning your own DNA...

@realDonaldTrump you are dancing on the graves of the 911 victims and our brave veterans. Saudi Arabia is a rogue terrorist country. They gave us 911, yet our President is blatantly lying to us on their behalf.
I don't know why he would trust them. CBS is FAKE NEWS and only wants to destroy him. They don't deserve a interview from our @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump @RealSheriffJoe -- I guess Trump was busy, but apparently Sheriff Joe likes the hookers at the bunny ranch -- Trump's probably been to the Bunny Ranch a lot ...

@StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Now that is true.
You must mean million dollars of blood money from Mister Bone Saw to keep @realDonaldTrump defending the Saudis butchering of Khashoggi. The USA is for sale to the highest $ to #TrumpCrimeFamily Right @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump #TrumpGrifters
One thing I CAN say about Avenatti, he can FOCUS. @realDonaldTrump not only can NOT focus, his strength of personality (which has NOTHING to do with intelligence) seems to rob those around him of THEIR ability to focus... Lordy, Lordy, SOMEBODY has TAPES

@realDonaldTrump can cut off funding to a country. He cannot re-direct the money to build the wall. That idea is illegal, since only Congress has the power to fund the wall. It sounds good to say things like that on TV, but it is not practical. Sorry, I wish it were possible.

Until I'm proven otherwise the ONLY reason I can see for supporting lying draft dodging corrupt morally bankrupt racist @RealDonaldTrump is because he brings out the white pride in you or your IQ is struggling to reach double digits. #MAGA #RacistParty
President Trump, I'm sure, has fabulous ideas for getting California back to what it once was - and as a Republican - as I've told all Republicans - you should stand with him and beside him so that he can guide this country back to greatness @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @HouseGOP
@realDonaldTrump This is what you do on constant basis to the American people: 1) Lie 2) Mock 3) Insult 4) Invoke fear 5) Sabotage Health Care 6) #Sinkhole the national debt.

@realDonaldTrump you tiny f'n despot. Historically, demonizing ones enemies, "dem's are evil", "dem's want ms-13", makes it easier to get the publics support for extreme measures. This is America bitch and we aren't going to tolerate it.
Imagine the laughs @realDonaldTrump 's friends will have when he pretends he's Khashoggi with his fingers and parts of his arms cut off!
So they admit it, now where is the body? Taking a month to figure it out? Not buying it and neither should @realDonaldTrump just because this guy gives u a lot of $ does not give him the right to do whatever he wants

@realDonaldTrump So, Rod Rosenstein gets to testify in a closed, classified setting before 2 Dimms and 2 retiring GOP. No oath. No transcript. Free to continue to lie his Poindexter ass off. This is the ringleader of the coup folks. The treasonous SOB responsible. What???
@SecPompeo has been all over the place lately same as @realDonaldTrump . Hardest working administration in my lifetime. #MAGA
Gestures? Gestures? But @realDonaldTrump didn't call for his supporters or his party to specifically go bodyslam journalists or Democrats?! Did he? Why are you crying?! Democrats however have made specific call to action to terrorize Republicans and it's been acted upon. IDIOT!
. @realdonaldtrump is a weak leader who is afraid of everyone except immigrants. He thinks that he might be able to win a fight against some who is hungry and tired. Trump fights the weak because that's what rich asshole bullies do. #BeBest #MelaniaHypocrite #TrumpIsAnAsshole

@realDonaldTrump thanks to Trump I was able to do something I've never done before. I managed to fill up my tank of gas for $62. My previous record was $52.
They need to bring in the military. These illegals are declaring war on us. Other countries are sending in 50,000 troops basically. That would be a act of war to not protect us citizen from them. To allow us to be invaded. We need our Military, @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept , if you have evidence the #CaravanaDeMigrantes is a #Democrats Party/ #SorosFunded Op, make it public NOW b/c when the border clash happens the public needs to know where to go for scalps and how to vote Nov 6th.

Eddie You Need To Wake Up and smell the coffee. The Republican Party is Rampant with Corruption and with @realDonaldTrump they are now on the move to SELL OUT the Majority Of this country. You might want to take some time and do some research. You will be surprised.
I love the TDS going on! Go @realDonaldTrump Best potus ever!
@realDonaldTrump "Everyone pays 1.45% of his or her income to Medicare/Medicaid. In return, they are eligible to receive medical benefits when they retire or if they have a long-term disability." It wasn't intended to pay for your tax cuts to the wealthy!

Why is @realDonaldTrump covering for a murderer in Saudi Arabia? Is it really about the arms sales or is it about what he'll lose for his own personal benefit when the Saudi's pay him for his hotel, etc?
@realDonaldTrump Lies . . . even about successes. Unbelievable!
@realDonaldTrump please help our country to be what it should be. Let the haters know they are not accepted here and follow through with it. It's all in your hands sir. Some people do follow by example. Too many people are suffering. Both sides together equal the greatest country

HEY! @realDonaldTrump why don't you freeze all arms sales to #SaudiArabia ? Follow the example of a #RealLeader like @_AngelikaMerkel
Instead of calling up the military to fight innocent people fleeing violence - send the military to Honduras, boot the gangs & give these people their country back! @realDonaldTrump @SenBennetCO @MichaelAvenatti @elizabethforma @BetoORourke @funder @maddow
I imagine @VP constantly pestering @realDonaldTrump the last 2 years. "Mr President, when do I get to punish the gays and the LGBTQ sodomites?" With Trump essentially brushing him off until, Pence gets some Saudi blackmail material on Trump last week and makes his play.
@JoyAnnReid @hardball @AriMelber I am going to predict the future. In January 2019, @realDonaldTrump will be indicted on espionage with the Mossad along with @DonaldJTrumpJr and Jared @jaredkushner . The Israelis helped them get elected. Both will be in prison after that.
Will people actually just believe this without really thinking about it? Congress not in session, November 11 days away, no discussion about this bill to date..... how dumb do you think we are @realDonaldTrump PLEASE people use your own brain to think!!
Finally tally: #ElizabethWarren mentions @realDonaldTrump 24 times in the debate, and lied all the way.
@realDonaldTrump Trump is just stupid. He is spending billions and billions on a immigration policy that has slowed down border xings. In fact the border xings are going up. This is what happens when incompetence runs the country
