@realDonaldTrump I wish Prez. Trump could provide some aid and incentives to Mexico as a part of negotiated NAFTA (USMCA) deal to employ the migrants in industries along the entire stretch of Mexican highway. Maybe US could import some products and also export corn and Ag

The Trump administration has ushered in a new era of fake news by a fake president who spawns daily fake "truths." And to what end? A fake kingdom? This is the 20th century.

Had a 30 year old man come to my home in Missouri wearing a Nazi uniform for Halloween. He had kids and a wife with him. We ran him off, but in @realDonaldTrump 's America, he thought it was OK to wear such hate. Vote Nov. 6.
@realDonaldTrump This country is in need of a very good laugh, so please go ahead and try to end #BirthrightCitizenship with executive order so we can double over laughing

On @realDonaldTrump : Since the nation is defined by its inherent virtue rather than by its future potential, politics becomes a discussion of good and evil rather than a discussion of possible solutions to real problems.
@realDonaldTrump you pay for it. Walking refugees do NOT require that. Pay for PTSD treatment also for these migrant families from your abuse and war crimes.
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/Fehm4Ve7vT
@realDonaldTrump I highly recommend that you seek treatment for your mental problems. It helps. If you are to be our president for much longer you must seek medical help. No references to your actions, statements, or tweets are needed to support the evidence that you need help.
News flash! That is all @realDonaldTrump has EVER focused on.
There is nothing @realDonaldTrump has done can be described as loving.

You forgot to add @realDonaldTrump to the end of that (comma first, of course!). #fixed

@realDonaldTrump , YOU unqualified, both as a human being and as a president. This is the conspiracy theory started by the Campbell Soup executive (he was fired after the shooting for this) and it was apparently the final straw for the Pittsburgh man who killed 11 Jews.
Best POTUS , FLOTUS and DOTUS! Ever! America is doing great! MAGA! @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump "Who's boat is this boat?" outsells all tRUMP books combined!
If you're not quite understanding of the above post: You'd have your wall if it weren't for the current @POTUS , @realDonaldTrump , backing out on a deal he accepted and then backpedaled on. Ergo: It's his fault, because he sucks at negotiating.
Since taking office do you believe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has made #America better or worse?? Please vote and retweet to spread poll for a wider sampling from both sides thanks!! #Resist #MAGA #VoteBlue #Trump #wednesdaywisdom #WednesdayMotivation
