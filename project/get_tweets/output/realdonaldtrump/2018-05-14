Iran has called for Jihad in America - pre=planned by #ShadowGov 't #Obama Iran has told them to proceed so Lock n Load America. @realDonaldTrump
Could you imagine all the hassle and security @realDonaldTrump would have to take to the Walter Reed with him?. Could you imagine the disruption this would cause the hospital staff and patients? Stop making him out to be an asshole when this was a selfless move.
@realDonaldTrump I pray that our first lady will recover totally. Blessings and great health for our presidents family. You are loved and I thank you for all you have done and will continue to do with God's grace and inspiration. Peter Manos From Roslindale ma
ion since @realDonaldTrump took office. Today's moving of the US em
So 2700 injured, 1350 by gunfire, 58 dead. I wonder why everyone warned our countries cheif dumbass @realDonaldTrump not to move the American embassy. Everything he does is in an attempt to prove others wrong. You're a failure as a human being. The bloods on your hands now.
@realDonaldTrump is Leaker In Chief. The invective applies to him.
Just remember that none of this is normal. Don't ever normalize @realDonaldTrump . He is a disgrace. This is not normal.

@realDonaldTrump Thinking of FLOTUS- My beat partner had a similar procedure several years ago- had to stay off feet to make sure femoral artery incision healed sufficiently. Too much activity too soon, could open it & be most unfortunate. Praying for Melonia's speedy recovery!
Has our society slid back enough that we can non judgementally call @realDonaldTrump a #retard

Hey @realDonaldTrump , could i get a new letter? There's a missprint on mine. I'd prefer Mr. Wilder this time. pic.twitter.com/LsgtAlQYJ3
If anyone has an issue with the "action" by @realDonaldTrump , then they should have had an issue with the "decision" by Bush and Obama as well (oh sorry, I forgot....they PROMISED/AGREED to do it, but just DIDN'T). Can the Left see the big hole in this?
@realDonaldTrump wow! you really intent on ruining your country and ur supporters are still too dumb to see it. Never have I seen a worse president or administration. Its truly embarassing to watch the worlds leading country reduced to a laughing stock and pathetic outsider. SAD!
who is it that keeps tweeting, crying, and yelling about LEAKS? lol @realDonaldTrump you always are the one to cry leak leak leak....so of course the media reports the trash coming out of your mouth
Trump paid @AGPamBondi $25,000 so she would not prosecute @realDonaldTrump Trump University. She better praise him. The alternative is messy.
We need bullish News flow from the plebeian savour himself @realDonaldTrump #JuliusCaesarPoppedOff #CanYou ? Make the markets rip again, just say China is cool for now

Every President since Reagan promised to move the capitol of Israel to Jerusalem. #Hamas has been a terror organization since its beginning. @realDonaldTrump followed thru on a promise every #POTUS BEFORE him made. Go back to making crappy music.

Good for her not giving her ID to paid thugs. Not surprising the 'barely made it through high school' cop can't answer. This is what shithole @realDonaldTrump has made just fine. Newsflash: we're not going to allow this utter BS.

If it's not true then it's not a leak, it's a lie. If it is true, then it is a leak. Which is it @realDonaldTrump ? You can't have it both ways.
People realize that your administration is corrupt and against decency in all areas. We will find out the traitors and cowards who violate our values: @realDonaldTrump
Guess he forgot he was a father? Had a father? Maybe he was hatched? @realDonaldTrump
