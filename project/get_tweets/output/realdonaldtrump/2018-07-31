I am watching the Trump rally in Florida on @FoxNews and peeking at CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and guess what they are talking about? They are Trump bashing! No news about the rally. They are truly the Democrat puppets or vice versa. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump is jealous of people with real money, buy people money, not washing Vlad cash money.

@realDonaldTrump People need an ID to buy groceries? Only time I presented an ID to buy groceries was when I wrote checks! But nope generally a person DOES NOT need an ID to buy groceries. So your WRONG!

@realDonaldTrump I just saw something on tv about Medicare for all. So if that happens, does it mean we will no longer have to pay the Medicare premium?
My combat veteran uses VETERANS CHOICE for his back injury now.. amazing the VA never recommended a Chiropractor. Because of CHOICE he goes to one once a month now. He comes out of each appointment literally dancing to the car! #ThankYouTRUMP @realDonaldTrump

Why would Melania - full of grace and beauty - give this guy a moment of her time? That would give him the attention that he desperately needs. @realDonaldTrump
With all @realDonaldTrump has accomplished he should call his campaign The Great American Tour instead of a campaign.
@realDonaldTrump So if "collusion is no crime" and apparently according to you, it was only committed by "crooked Hillary & Dems", then why mention it at all? Are you saying that Hillary & Dems committed no crimes? What drives your obsession? Guilty traitor conscience maybe!
. @RealDonaldTrump , Con Man, Elitist, and someone who committed treason with Russia - thinks Americans need an ID to go buy groceries.

Stop giving @realDonaldTrump and his campaign coverage which reinforces his message to his base.

A fan of 70's and 80's music, I finally figured out the music analogy for the @realDonaldTrump and @BarackObama cults. Trump is Molly Hatchett's Dave Hlubek (rough, crude and loud) - Obama is Lionel Ritchie (smooth, cool and soft). Two groups that you would never seen together.
