DJT keeps harping on arming teachers! His answer to the carnage is TALK as he says it would be a states issue. He is so OUT of TOUCH., but of course he supports the NRAs response - more guns! Utterly clueless and spineless @realdonaldtrump #neveragain
They were picked by the nationalist to use MKUltra on- thru the airwaves. These are the domestic terrorist that Trump is passing the Truth Act for. They will be coined Domestic Terrorist and arrested. Go Trump! @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump My Iowa State Senators Chuck Grassely ACCEPTED $235,907 from the NRA, State Senator Joni Ernst ACCEPTED $331,984 from NRA & my Iowa Rep Rob Blum ACCEPTED $45,239! They are REPUBLICAN! Are you going to RETURN this BLOOD MONEY back to the NRA? REGISTER TO VOTE!

@realDonaldTrump Sir as veteran there are a few issues that I think we need to address. None more important than protecting our children. I think I might have a solution that I would like to share with you. A serious win win for all of America.
@potus @realDonaldTrump Another failure. Sad!
@KatCapps @realDonaldTrump Donnie only knows what he hears on fox. Reality doesn't enter into his fantasy world
Moving quicker than Watergate. In Watergate, honest Republicans were trying to find out the real truth. As Howard Baker asked, "what did the President know and when did he know it." If @realDonaldTrump is truly innocent, he should be for full prosecution of Flynn, Manafort, etc.
@realDonaldTrump lol. What would you expect? These are the people who bought your bs all along.
@realDonaldTrump I oppose the military parade. Do NOT have it. #notinAmerica

Well-oiled weathervane is a political insult that fits @realDonaldTrump actually more than one might think at a glance.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr @davidhogg111 is a paid mouthpiece for the Left/Elitists. Take heed to anything he says at your own peril!!!! It has been determined that he actually graduated from High School in Rhonda Beach, CA in 2015.

@realDonaldTrump : Which hockey team are you supporting tonight ? Your country of origin Germany or your next future exile country Russian ? #Mullerishere
@realDonaldTrump and @FoxNews - Despite an overwhelming House majority you have failed to impose SANCTIONS on Russia. You are a traitor to this republic and the only illegal disgrace is your family occupying the WH. Obama followed the letter of the law, documented in a memo.
...it is interesting to observe when a tip given to FBI of mass killing is eminent they do not follow up but a tip given by Democrats of @realDonaldTrump misconducts, FBI treats it as high priority and investigates.
