@realDonaldTrump #GOP in some states - GA, ND - has to resort to cheating. They have an experienced leader in that.
"She's a phony lying fake American Indian socialist-elitist fraud who has never uttered ONE true statement and who cares more about her own bank account than the hardworking people of MA. Pocahontas. When are you getting a casino?" @HowieCarrShow @DiehlForSenate @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump thanks to Trump I was able to do something I've never done before. I managed to fill up my tank of gas for $62. My previous record was $52.
They need to bring in the military. These illegals are declaring war on us. Other countries are sending in 50,000 troops basically. That would be a act of war to not protect us citizen from them. To allow us to be invaded. We need our Military, @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept , if you have evidence the #CaravanaDeMigrantes is a #Democrats Party/ #SorosFunded Op, make it public NOW b/c when the border clash happens the public needs to know where to go for scalps and how to vote Nov 6th.
@realDonaldTrump please call up the US Military now to stop this invasion.... #maga #trump2020

Eddie You Need To Wake Up and smell the coffee. The Republican Party is Rampant with Corruption and with @realDonaldTrump they are now on the move to SELL OUT the Majority Of this country. You might want to take some time and do some research. You will be surprised.
I love the TDS going on! Go @realDonaldTrump Best potus ever!
@realDonaldTrump "Everyone pays 1.45% of his or her income to Medicare/Medicaid. In return, they are eligible to receive medical benefits when they retire or if they have a long-term disability." It wasn't intended to pay for your tax cuts to the wealthy!
Two men @realDonaldTrump and @tedcruz putting their differences aside and working together for the good of the country #RealAmericans

Why is @realDonaldTrump covering for a murderer in Saudi Arabia? Is it really about the arms sales or is it about what he'll lose for his own personal benefit when the Saudi's pay him for his hotel, etc?
@realDonaldTrump Lies . . . even about successes. Unbelievable!
@realDonaldTrump please help our country to be what it should be. Let the haters know they are not accepted here and follow through with it. It's all in your hands sir. Some people do follow by example. Too many people are suffering. Both sides together equal the greatest country
@realDonaldTrump Go fuck yourself... There, said it

HEY! @realDonaldTrump why don't you freeze all arms sales to #SaudiArabia ? Follow the example of a #RealLeader like @_AngelikaMerkel
Instead of calling up the military to fight innocent people fleeing violence - send the military to Honduras, boot the gangs & give these people their country back! @realDonaldTrump @SenBennetCO @MichaelAvenatti @elizabethforma @BetoORourke @funder @maddow
I imagine @VP constantly pestering @realDonaldTrump the last 2 years. "Mr President, when do I get to punish the gays and the LGBTQ sodomites?" With Trump essentially brushing him off until, Pence gets some Saudi blackmail material on Trump last week and makes his play.
@JoyAnnReid @hardball @AriMelber I am going to predict the future. In January 2019, @realDonaldTrump will be indicted on espionage with the Mossad along with @DonaldJTrumpJr and Jared @jaredkushner . The Israelis helped them get elected. Both will be in prison after that.
Will people actually just believe this without really thinking about it? Congress not in session, November 11 days away, no discussion about this bill to date..... how dumb do you think we are @realDonaldTrump PLEASE people use your own brain to think!!
Finally tally: #ElizabethWarren mentions @realDonaldTrump 24 times in the debate, and lied all the way.
@realDonaldTrump Trump is just stupid. He is spending billions and billions on a immigration policy that has slowed down border xings. In fact the border xings are going up. This is what happens when incompetence runs the country
