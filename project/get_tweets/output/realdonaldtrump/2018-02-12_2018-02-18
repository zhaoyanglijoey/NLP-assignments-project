@realDonaldTrump @SecretarySonny the proposed $17 billion and $213 billion savings from the SNAP budget is money lost from hard working retailers.
Does anyone remember the movie, "The Super" from 1991? Joe Pesci is a slumlord & has to live in one of his dilapidated rental properties? I think something similar is needed for @MickMulvaneyOMB @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan because of their war on the poor, disabled, & elderly.
JUST IN: Judge grants second nationwide injunction preventing @POTUS administration from rescinding DACA program as lawsuits proceed. - It's time @realDonaldTrump replaces some of these judges. I have never known any @POTUS having so much trouble doing his job.

It's always encouraging for politicians when the President, @realDonaldTrump , and @GOP put in bribes for them to vote how they'd prefer. @BobCorker #CorkerKickback #TennesseeIsTurningBlue
@realDonaldTrump @SenatorDurbin Hope you both would be ok with words of condolences when one of yours would be killed and those in charge say now is not the time to discuss. See my next tweet for a proposal or give me yours.:

We've been hit by 18 school shootings so far in 2018. EIGHTEEN! This is ridiculous! Somehow, @realDonaldTrump and the US Government and us the people will have to find a way to limit these shootings! #ParklandSchoolShooting

Seems like $130k in hush money is overkill. @realDonaldTrump admits that women are nothing more than genital grabbing playthings and his adoring base didn't seem to give a damn about that! Curious to see what she was being hushed about. Can't just be about a roll in the hay!
Florida Well....at least @realDonaldTrump has gone on record against school shootings and that no child should be afraid at school. Still no word from him opposing domestic violence or suggesting that no woman should be afraid in her own home.

45 days into 2018 and already 7 school shootings. 20 killed, dozens injured. This cannot be tolerated anymore. When will our government pick the safety of our children over money from the NRA? @realDonaldTrump enough with your prayers. The time for gun control is now.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @NRA @GOP , let me guess, today isn't the day to talk about gun control. You are all complicit cowards. #DouglasHighSchool

@realDonaldTrump this is the 29th mass shooting of 2018 & it's only 45 days into year. 17 dead. NO MORE! Not 1 more death frm guns! When will you publicly say anything about guns? Still too early? Vegas shooting was months ago, yet so quiet about this issue which is non partisan.
One thing we all know is true: @realDonaldTrump is owned by @NRA to the tune of 35 million $$ and Russia for some unknown amount. HE WILL DO NOTHING!
@realDonaldTrump ... Liar-in-Chief. Complicit. Fact.
@realDonaldTrump how many children are going to have to die due to school shootings before you actually do something?? Asking for a friend
@realDonaldTrump Not much point in being sorry for the shooting, Orange Boy. Innocent American kids have to bear the consequences of being gun mad and this idiot having access to them.
@realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott @joenegronfl
@realDonaldTrump 17 DEAD! #StonemamDouglasHigh #BrowardCountyFL #schoolshooting #dosomething #guncontrol
@realDonaldTrump wants to blame all deaths by illegal immigrants on Dems. Does that mean we should blame all gun deaths on @GOP and @NRA
@realDonaldTrump Thank You Mr President, we all feel the same. Does this mean we can finally expect Gun Control??? I know Guns Don't Shoot People, but I also know, Guns dont shoot themselves.

@realDonaldTrump correction; Nancy Pelosi, what a disgrace while people are grieving. My prayers and condolences go out to the families, students, parents, teachers, staff, and the state of Florida.
Remember that @realDonaldTrump has filed for bankruptcy as often has he filed for military deferments. He's a con man and a coward. He has no idea how to effectively run a business. Why would he expect him to understand running a country or balancing its budget?
Happy Valentine's Day @realDonaldTrump . Care for a late night swim?
@realDonaldTrump Remember the feeling you felt just a couple of days ago when your daughter-in-law was assaulted with corn starch? Imagine how the moms and dads of those 17 dead kids in Florida are feeling tonight. You can do something but I'll bet that again you will do nothing.

@realdonaldtrump At your inauguration, you said "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now." 17(so far) people died today. What are you doing to stop "this American carnage"? How would you feel if your son or grandchild was a student at that school?
@realDonaldTrump and his republican minions want to replace food stamps with Blue Apron like boxes of food. Maybe they could use Soylent Green instead. Ship a few chips of Soylent Green at a low postage rate and problem solved.
@realDonaldTrump I implore you to talk with congress and get them to introduce a new bill that allows families to involuntarily institutionalize family who are mentally ill . We need those people off our streets and out of our schools !
Watching the clock and waiting for . @realdonaldtrump and . @FoxNews to blame the heritage of the shooter in #ParklandShooting . Countdown to either of them to mention #Latino . #Florida #schoolshooting
Where's the next school shooting gonna happen in America tomorrow? Fuck you @realDonaldTrump Fuck you @NRA #Terrorist #Florida
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The Florida school shooting ought to mean enough is enough. I'm an advocate of having guns available for hunting and self protection. But nobody needs an Automatic rifle for either of these. A handgun for protection and a shotgun for hunting is enough.

@realDonaldTrump hi yeah we clearly need gun control so if you could get the fuck on it that would be great:)

Well, to be accurate, @realDonaldTrump and his ilk don't "buy" or "pay for" anything, in any sense of those words. None of their kids or grandkids are ever among the dead. The NRA buys Trump et al and the kids, parents, teachers pay.

Another sad day in America. I can't see it becoming great again whilst kids can kill kids & kids get massacred in school. My heart goes out to all those affected by this horrible tragedy. No doubt; 1) @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will claim "fake news" 2) @NRA will want more guns
Wow. So inexpensive? Thought acting like a third world dictatorship would cost more. And only puts a relatively little more in debt. Wow. @GOP @realDonaldTrump

And if you voted for @realDonaldTrump FUCK YOU TOO
@realDonaldTrump You have often pointed to mental illness as the underlying cause for mass shootings, but one of your earliest actions as president was to undo a regulation that would make it more difficult for people with a known mental illness to buy guns. BRAVO to you.
@realDonaldTrump You gutless turd, get out of the NRA'S pockets and start working on real gun control
@realDonaldTrump POS- I hope it isn't to far out of your way to visit the recent Parkland School shooting site on your way to Marlogo (40 miles away) - this weekend for MORE GOLF at TAXPAYER expense U POS you need to resign! #BlueWave2018 #EndCitizensUnited #Resistance #NoWall
Instead of discussing mental health management strategies after the 8th school shooting in the first 7 weeks of 2018 you need to be altering your defective gun laws so that people with mental health conditions can not access a weapon and murder people @realDonaldTrump

America is now more dangerous than fucking Syria. And to our douche bag in chief @realDonaldTrump , these kids weren't killed by Muslims, just by another white guy wearing a Make America Great hat.
4th Circuit violates the law. @realDonaldTrump had every right by statute to limit immigration per Chapter 8 U.S. Code 1282 section f. Hopefully @Scotus will enforce the law instead of allowing circuit courts to make up new ones.

@realDonaldTrump Guns should be issued, not purchased. Like a drivers license. @POTUS It should be a privilege to own a gun, not a right. #guncontrol
Why not give #DACA rights to stay. But they cannot vote or own gun for 15 years. ?? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump they committed a crime so they should not be allowed. That will weed out which #Democrat is really worried for them!!!
@realDonaldTrump this is a look at the babies you took away from there parents.

@realDonaldTrump if there is ONE thing you do right. Address school shootings. We should not be afraid to send our children to school.
We don't even know. There is no indication that he was being treated for anything. This is a b.s. deflect that @realDonaldTrump lives for using! It's also common given for a white suspect. His family knew of the gun yet, saw no problem with it. Who does that if he's mentally ill?

@realDonaldTrump please explain why the Russians thought you were running for President in January of 2014. Please also explain why if they did interfere you are still refusing to denounce Putin or impose the sanctions that 90+% of Congress passed? #Russians #Collusion #Mueller pic.twitter.com/NilVTl4Dgw
Imagine @realDonaldTrump and @seanhannity celebrating...together.
It just frustrates me so much how it takes Australia one massacre in 1996 that killed 35 people, to change gun laws and there has been NO massacres since the change and America is having 3 a week yet nothing is being changed with the gun laws?????? @realDonaldTrump u suck
Apparently this weeks American terrorist school shooter was @realDonaldTrump fan #maga #DoSomething pic.twitter.com/lVUhIdq8ti

Benedict @realDonaldTrump can think whatever delusional thoughts that these indictments vindicates his fat ass, but this is only the beginning. Mueller's crossing every T and dotting every I so when he indicts the Dotard there's no getting away from it.
@realDonaldTrump I can't believe that I forgot to message you! You're a useless, traitorous fuckshit. I hope you end up in prison. I hope you spend your twilight years in solitary, slowly going mad. Fuck you very much.

It must be so embarrassing for @realDonaldTrump to know how much money it took the Russians to get him elected. And he lost the popular vote.

Your @GOP colleagues aren't your friends, they'll throw you under the bus if it will save themselves and you know that to be true. @realdonaldtrump is how you got yourself into this situation in the first place so you need to remove yourself from him.

Bernie, why did you use the exact same talking points as @realDonaldTrump to attack Hillary if even then during the campaign you knew much of the info was pushed by Russia and gotten illegally?
@realDonaldTrump shut the fuck up you cheating bastard, you think just cause you got money you can cheat on your wives with hoes? Bitch shut up you non Presidential Bitch. Come at me!
@realDonaldTrump is the best thing to happen to america, hope that didn't go over y'all heads
Why should Americans expect any less from @realDonaldTrump Appointees. I guess @realDonaldTrump wants Domestic Abusers and Sexual Assaulters in his Administration, so they have something to compare and talk about.
#Trump @realDonaldTrump is too soft on #HillaryClinton and #Obama administration. They have done everything rotten and illegal to stop him winning and to carry out a coup once he won. They have not stopped yet. But their criminality and corruption is being covered up & let off.
@realDonaldTrump IS cowardly.. #CadetBoneSpurs

People need to realize that @SpeakerRyan , @realDonaldTrump and the rest of the @GOP do not care about the American people. They only care about themselves and the money from their donors.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS is a #FakePresident who lies to the American people.
Trump never denied Russian meddling. Muller was trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. He couldn't. Accusations by the Democrats and MSM that the @realDonaldTrump campaign colluded with the Russians are false. That's what Trump called a hoax and a witch hunt!
Democrats suck. They need victims and issues, they do not solve problems like our great President! If they would work with @realDonaldTrump they would win elections again.

Interestingly, if you look at some of those (entrenched power, corporate interest and propaganda in particular) they can almost be aligned with "drain the swamp" as espoused by @realdonaldtrump , so the GOP should really pull their finger out and get onboard. Course, they won't
President @realDonaldTrump , while doing nothing about Russian interference of our election, is crying " @POTUS44 should have done something."

Hey Liberals, you will not take away our guns and you will not take away our President. Your efforts are useless and your crazy is showing. @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @qanon76 @seanhannity @RealAlexJones
@IngrahamAngle . F*** Y**. You weren't being racist but who gives you the right to tell @KingJames or @KDTrey5 what to say. @realDonaldTrump is a joke and I'm from the UK and say it. Freedom of speech bitch. Quit your job and go in a hole. #NBAAllStar #NBA #USA #LauraIngraham

@realDonaldTrump eat a bag of dicks
@realDonaldTrump stop sending your kids to school
@gucci , I would like to request that you vacate your store at The #TrumpTower . Any money you give @realDonaldTrump supports him and his views. Please consider relocating to another location where your money won't contribute to a racist, greedy, unpatriotic, lying con artist
Remember when Melania voted for Hillary, @realDonaldTrump ? pic.twitter.com/1PvehdtsbY
Why does @realDonaldTrump want more mass shootings?
@realDonaldTrump parents keep kids at home now.
Truly a sad day when these teens are smarter than the American FBI!! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
I kinda think the Russian mafia swooped in paid off his bankruptcies, gave him cash to keep him flush and re-invest..they just plain OWN his fat ass. Then his proclivity for sex ... he was an easy target plus he's stupid What say you @realDonaldTrump .....pretty close to truth?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Yes, Mr. President, it's worth it! Thanks for putting up with all the BS for us and the country. You'd figure all American's would want a better country, but some, for whatever reason, want Socialism or Communism. Go figure! pic.twitter.com/rrj2rPmgMS
You think saying #FakeNews or blaming the @FBI is going to distract us from our mission? The only thing that is fake is you. Our commitment to #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives #GunControlNow #GunReformNow is very very real @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Time POTUS & FLOTUS to consider impromptu open town hall meetings where you do so well when directly answering the Liberal Voter. With your Press Sec as Moderator b/w you and Jane/Joe Public. No need for debate, just Q&A.
So because Obama didn't take prevent Russian election interference, you are just going to make sure they can get away with more of it? We can now add #DerelictionOfDuty to the many crimes committed by @realDonaldTrump
