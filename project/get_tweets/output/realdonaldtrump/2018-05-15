#CA45 has done great under @RepMimiWalters and America has done great under @realDonaldTrump , linking them together doesn't make me dislike her. It makes me like her more. We don't want to be a sanctuary City/state and we want to #BuildTheWall
@realDonaldTrump It's time to fire Sessions. There will be backlash but your support will grow. It's what everyone wants. Farrell from Judicial Watch wants you to now be more aggressive and stop letting the so called process work itself out. We all agree. It's time, 16 months...
Just imagine what @realDonaldTrump could accomplish with out the special counsel and all the members of the resistance #MAGA
@seanhannity send you karate videos and him stretching? @realDonaldTrump
No @POTUS , It's not apple jazz. No...! It's not 'I apply jizz' either.

I cannot wait to see the whining and excuses from the media after the midterm elections in November. It will almost be as good as when @realDonaldTrump took away their hopes for four more years of Obama policies.

Servicing @realDonaldTrump is certainly no honor. Just ask @StormyDaniels .
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, why is Sessions and Wray still around? A lot of your supporters are mystified.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @USSenate Dem politicians and their media cohorts (swamp) would rather cheer NoK, Jerusalem embassy, and any USA agenda resistance than admit Trump/GOP gains & accomplishments for the American people to date #drain the swamp!
Just in time to allow Russia to hack the 2018 and 2020 elections. No collusion here though... @realDonaldTrump could you be any more obvious???

Retweeted Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ): ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.
News flash @realDonaldTrump . The leaks are coming directly from your people. Not only do they not respect you, they don't even like you.
. @TheBrodyFile of @cbnnews says that an episode in which @realdonaldtrump was making fun of @realbencarson @secretarycarson on the golf course is evidence of "Trump's softer side". Then goes on to say the repulsive Christian hypocrisy towards Trump is just "grace" PATHETIC!

To be fair...making @realDonaldTrump look like a fool isn't really much of a challenge. Macron, Turnbull, Merkel, Trudeau etc. have been doing it for ages. Not to mention Putin and his group.
