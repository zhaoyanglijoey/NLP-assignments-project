@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump This is an invasion force - thousands of men are planning to storm our border. Please allow the military to handle this under the direct guidance of Sec Mattis - this is not an issue for the President to handle personally. Let the expert do it.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Where does Shepherd Smith get off lecturing the President and the American people on the caravan? Fox execs, fire him or do us all a favor and let him go to CNN where he belongs!!!

@realDonaldTrump why are you such a liar? Please answer. I would like to know and many patriotic Americans would also like to know.
Awww....look at all the women and children. Let us not forget that @realDonaldTrump @POTUS is always 10 steps ahead. October surprise?
@ChinaUncensored w/Caravan coming from S & ties to Venezuela funding is it possible the Chinese Communist Party is funneling $ via their client to impact US Election & harm @realDonaldTrump ? CCP massive election interference backfiring?
Its obvious, @realDonaldTrump and the GOP paid for these desperate people to come as close as possible to the US borders as a ploy. He knows he is losing the fight. Why do you allow him to think of you as a bunch of idiots who know nothing?
And yet the last guy in the world insisting that Bin Salman strongly denies it and therefore should have the same presumption of innocence as Kavanaugh was none other than clumsy cover-up critic in chief himself, the one and only @realDonaldTrump aka Tiny Mushroom.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President; Scott Brown, who is running against Senator Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire has identified that we now have Ebola-bearing foreigners alongside others harboring criminal or terrorist intent all casually strolling across the US border, Build the wall
My parents immigrated legally from South America. I was born here. We all are angry at the blatant disregard for our laws and our citizens. Seal the border tightly @realDonaldTrump !
@realDonaldTrump "The Crown Prince strongly denied it". What a pushover Trump is. He's WEAK!

@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL @ScottforFlorida The racist, incorrect and inopportune comments of President Trump seem to be aimed at causing Puerto Ricans in Florida to withdraw their support for Scott and DeSantis. Politicians of Puerto Rico are equal to anyone in our Nation.
Yeah, that caravan of "Central Americans" look well funded. Sleeping on the wet ground, breast feeding, in FRONT of everyone, all sunburned. Has it ever hit you @realDonaldTrump things must be that bad to want to come to this shithole, and put up w/old grey, haired, racist men?

I'm an evangelical & used to support @realDonaldTrump but then I woke up. I wish Christians who still support Trump even after all the evidence of his crimes would do some serious soul-searching. Now. Non-believers are watching.

In this pic @realDonaldTrump hair resembles creme brulee.
Yup, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is essentially complicit in murder, sending these innocent women and children back to be killed. Trump is most definitely not "pro-life."
@realDonaldTrump mr. President I applaud you for willing to send the military are men with lethal force and pepper ball guns they work great tear gas lasers all the high-tech microwave irritants to turn these people back making no man's land strip
Or put as many lies out as possible because surely some of them will be believed. @realDonaldTrump is putting his lie machine & dirty tricks into overdrive!

No one wants to mess with the United States of America, while #POTUS @realDonaldTrump is in charge. He makes enemies feel the way Ronald Reagan did... what the hell is this guy capable of A powerful country needs a powerful leader. We have one.
Hey @realMikeLindell you have an extremely low opinion of God to say such thing! Unless you think God is putin! Newsflash for you mikey: putin is evil & he put his evil puppet @realDonaldTrump there in the WH to destroy your country! Sleep on it buddy! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

@realDonaldTrump The liar, there have no riots in Californa since 1992. Trump is a DAMN LIAR, Fraud, con artist, mob supporter, conspirator, mentally challenge and likely a Fricking Traitor. I pity people vote for his interest. #WeThePeople #TheResistance
uh oh @realDonaldTrump called himself a "Nationalist". That's the last straw, I mean we ALL know that he just meant to say he's proud of the U.S. but what if he really was "signaling" the imagined and fake underground racists that rule every liberal city?
That's it @realDonaldTrump , I've had pic.twitter.com/rEwrnhwyG5
I grew up not knowing my father, i grew up being molested and Gay, idk how to be a man cause no one was there to show me, A woman can't teach a boy to be a man. So to imagine these kids separated from their parents is breaking @realDonaldTrump Don't care
I'm shocked, shocked to find out @realDonaldTrump lied
Here's the Obama rally in Las Vegas I promised I'd send you. I went to yours and his both. Your messages offer respectively, one of hate and one of hope. That is why I will do everything in my power to the #BlueWave vote against you. @realDonaldTrump https:// youtu.be/gseeust-v4I

Surely you are not comparing this statement by Obama to the frothy mouthed rants about a caravan full of brown criminals and middle easterners coming to get us that @realDonaldTrump is using to scare people into voting for lying @tedcruz ? #BetoForTexas
Watching the news and reporters calling him out @realDonaldTrump on many things he has said and no answers was a thing of beauty.
I hope @realDonaldTrump wins the lottery!
And there might be lions and tigers and bears... Oh my. But there isn't. But it is full of @realDonaldTrump lies. The whole world is full of @realDonaldTrump lies.

And now @realDonaldTrump just sent out a fundraising notice that he'll match EVERY DONATION, DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, which ANYONE with 1/8 of a brain knows is a LIE. He's OPENLY LYING TO HIS OWN SUPPORTERS.
That doesn't seem to agree with anything that @realDonaldTrump has said in the last few weeks. But I guess honesty is no longer a virtue that the right aspires to? Good job at selling yourself out.
Nationalist is not the same as White Nationalist. A nationalist (small "n") is someone who puts the interests of their country first. I am one. #Trump @realDonaldTrump #GOP #DontAcceptTheLiberalMediasNarrative

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO This is something else... not surprising at this point sadly.
I hope and pray that @realDonaldTrump sent the CIA and FBI to infiltrate the migrant mob to find the sources of this attack on America!
The only proof that we have is that @realDonaldTrump is a Liar-In-Chief #factcheck
