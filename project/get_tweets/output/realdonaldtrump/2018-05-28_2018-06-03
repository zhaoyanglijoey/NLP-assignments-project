Although it is a somewhat self-inflicted, there can be no crueler punishment than having to live with @realDonaldTrump . I feel so sorry for QE2 who apparently has to meet with him when he visits England. Shame on Theresa May if she insisted on it!

@realDonaldTrump you are one sick and disgusting person. Memorial Day is not about you. It is not about politics. You will go down in history as the worst president America has had. Perhaps that will make you happy that you are the best of the worst.

I wish the same could be done to @realDonaldTrump

Agree. @realDonaldTrump could care less abt pee video, his affairs or how he gets money and if all that is proven. The only thing about which he cares is it proven that he, @JaredKusher , @parscale , Cambridge(Mercers) and Putin actually stole EC results. #TrumpStoleElection

So @CNN @MSNBC & other leftist media tweet out a pic this weekend of immigrant children in a cage stating it was a result of @realDonaldTrump . When they found out pics were from 2014, Obama admin, they deleted pics. Guess it only appalled them when they thought trump responsible.

@realDonaldTrump I hear Kim has a new violin. Named the Trump Dotard model. Embellished with Tillerson/Kelly Moronic options.
@realDonaldTrump wants this to happen so @realDonaldTrump @georgesoros and the @BillClinton @TommyRobinsonPM pedophile ring have an easier time taking disenfranchised children. They fooled the poor whites who fight with each other.
Just like @realDonaldTrump likes it
I kno right? Like @realDonaldTrump or something!
We all knew this. I think our president still thinks he needs to get a Nobel Peace Prize, however. Someone ought to tell @realDonaldTrump that this whole 'negotiating' is way, WAAAAY over his head. He can't find his way out of a paper bag!
Ignore all the side show drama and put all efforts into giving @realDonaldTrump the congress he needs 2018 reelect him in 2020 and The Opposition will be on Life Support/Suicide Watch! #TheStory #TuckerCarlson #Hannity #IngrahamAngle
@realDonaldTrump won't say that the Russians did it - but he has no problem criticizing Mueller... What a great American Trump is! Dodged the draft. Does all his manufacturing in Asia. And Tweets about saving Chinese jobs! GREAT patriot right there!!!
We need to figure out a way to make this right. @therealroseanne and everyone on the show and her crew should not have to suffer because of the deranged left. Neither should truth and justice be quashed by the lies of the #DeepState . @realDonaldTrump #GreatAwakening
With any luck, you'll be gone by then @realDonaldTrump . pic.twitter.com/2XOVJOhUaC
She knows what she's doing. She doesn't need to explain herself , defend herself, point out the double standard, hysteria,and hypocrisy . Her supporters are doing it for her. This is way more powerful. Sometimes silence is louder than words. @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne
@realDonaldTrump is an an enemy of the people and an enemy of the state.
If (when?) @realDonaldTrump f-ing defends @therealroseanne 's racist comments, I am going to lose my shit.
@realDonaldTrump I agree with The Five Greg Gutfield, Mr President, he said you need to get out front of the Amnesty Trot by dems & Fake Republicans. An appearance from you in the Oval directing the True Legal Immigration Plan should help educate voting American Citizens. Inform!
@realDonaldTrump Have the 45th President one and know this one @MAGA Thanks President Trump for Helping the American People pic.twitter.com/d0qBWgVGFZ
Wonder why you used hashtag and not @realDonaldTrump ?
@realDonaldTrump needs to hire you. You are quick with responses and articulating the conservative views. Conservatives are not racist.
I confess, I'm the Russian that hacked @therealroseanne . Really I'm gonna #BoycottABC ! @ABCNetwork what @TheView @JimmyKimmelLive say, wow THEY call that comedy, what a joke. THEY attack @realDonaldTrump & HIS FAMILY ! ETHICS @ABC whats good for a Goose should be for a Gander !

@realDonaldTrump total con artist
. @RealDonaldTrump & Congress need to act NOW to help the people of Puerto Rico. Too many innocent people died because of the United States' lack of response. President Trump should have been helping Puerto Rico instead of golfing and tweeting about a #WitchHunt .
Boycott the butches @ABCNetwork @EWScrippsCo @Disney @DisneyPixar we are done we voted @realDonaldTrump in and he's staying we don't need your service we also back @therealroseanne
This is why @realDonaldTrump never apologizes, especially, when he knows he's wrong.
@realDonaldTrump you are such a role model for indecency and deception. No wonder your wife left you.
Hey would you want to be seen with a racist all the time? @FLOTUS - Tell @realDonaldTrump to call out Roseanne Barr for her racial comments. Is #BeBest over?
@tedcruz should be replaced. He is poor in gun control, poor on immigration, poor in racial harmony and diversity, poor in race relations. Above all, his inconsistent approach on the excesses of the @realDonaldTrump admin is worrying. @MSNBC @GOP @SenateGOP @congressdotgov

@PressSec Sarah Sanders claims that @realDonaldTrump deserves an apology ... Ok, well here goes: "I am sorry you're a racist Nazi." Phew ... it felt good to get that off my chest ...
Then why did @realDonaldTrump say he would raise the age?
@Tennessean how can anyone who is educated and well read support @realDonaldTrump when he lies and lies and lies. (To say nothing of his moral depravity) Says a lot about Tennessee and its residents.

The interesting part of the story is that you 'estimated' the crowd size.. Lol...did you eyeball it ?? Lol. Thought journalist write based on fact. Just proves @realDonaldTrump 's point, dishonest, biased click bait drive-by media
I for one give you credit for your apology, but you know you cannot unsay what you said. Everyone has said something they regret at some time. Unfortunately your buddy @realDonaldTrump will have labelled you a loser for apologizing. If only he had the balls to apologize.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump HOPE? Well said Governor. You just used the one word that is literally fueling all divides in this Country. I am currently writing a book about this and how it has killed Hope and Ruined lives. I am also writing a letter to President Trump.

@realDonaldTrump Having a whordashian in the White House is disgusting . She is worthless, has done nothing to better society . The whole whordashian family is bottom feeders . You lost a lot of points allowing that
@realDonaldTrump LYING yet again about 'crowd size' at his Nashville rally recently. Trump says 12,000 ppl were seated, 'there are 12,000 seats, we had 12,000 ppl there". "Tht venue MAX's out at roughly 9,000" says fire marshal. Officials say roughly 5,000 ppl shwd-up, NOT 12,000
The ONLY thing the #RACIST White House objected to was the word #feckless . @iamsambee is right; just like @michelleisawolf was right. @IvankaTrump is a #FecklessC **t She knows it & @realDonaldTrump knows it.
Nope truth hurts, McCain whether he is sick or not needs to face fact. That is why we voted for @realDonaldTrump he calls it like it is no sugar coating

Supposed conservative angry at @realDonaldTrump imposing tariffs on socialist Europe and Canada should remember that the unfair advantage we gave them in trade is used to fund their anti-American Marxism. Now they'll need to embrace free markets.
Trump spends that much in a month in his golf outings and the cost of AF1. Benghazi cost us 8 M and no indictments. Mueller has gotten plenty of results. I gladly pay for the Mueller investigation to get to the truth about @realDonaldTrump
We are watching a movie. What are they playing at? Believe Gowdy is a good guy. What is the plan for him? Why the need for him to appear at odds? Think the America First people in Congress now control the narrative. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Good Job! Personal income and spending is up, the GDP has grown, strengthening the economy and the USD. I vote to increase steel and aluminum EU exports taxes and car import taxes as well. Nonfarm payroll have also gone from 164K to 188K, again strengthening USD
I don't get why all these celebs are say #sorry ( #apology ) on what they say everyday. Its who they are, why hide it to make a soft one happy? I mean has nobody ever been called a name? #getoverit BUT if everyone wants to lose their marbles start focusing on @realDonaldTrump
I for one am very tired of the double standard! How is it ok that @realDonaldTrump can say and do much much worse to women and no one cares..but someone calls Ivanka a bad name and everyone is up in arms. If you are pissed about Ivanka you should be pissed about the others
Dear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump , will you tweet later tonight or tomorrow that you will go after Amazon $ AMZN ?Thanks, sir. P.S. great job on the tariffs and start the trade war with our allies, sir.

I bet if there was a law passed that did not allow @realDonaldTrump to pardon anyone connected with the investigation related to trump, his campaign or the Russian interference, you would hear more squealing than a pig farm with fresh slop.
What I don't understand is why no one mentioning the reference to incest but rather with the greater focus on the vile c word. This is not the first time this has been inferred with President @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump . That is so sick and wrong!!

How much has @realDonaldTrump 's golf trips cost taxpayers @FoxNews ?
IMHO, I really think Rudy Giuliani has been sitting in a dark room, rocking back and forth, & talking to himself since @realDonaldTrump dangled Secretary of State in front of him like the @StateFarm Fisherman. The call to be counsel has seen him emerge from his lair like Gollum.

@realDonaldTrump : Please, before the summit, would you please learn to bow when someone bows to you. In the Far East it is only a sign of respect. This is a common greeting and you should do it too. I have a Chinese sister-in-law. She bowed before my parents graves. Mad me cry.

This is the America @realDonaldTrump has brought us. It's sick. Where is the FBI???
The mounting evidence of @realDonaldTrump criminal acts has led to a comparison between Trump and Richard Nixon....but I think the comparison is not well placed. Richard Nixon before he became a politician was an attorney Donald Trump before he became a politician was a crook.

@realDonaldTrump on tariffs -- "or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into U.S. coffers?" I swear to god he is the antithesis of the most interesting man in the world. He is the most ignorant man in the world.

When we have a moron like @realDonaldTrump as President, America could lose everything that is why we #Resist because we won't stand for #Putinspuppet taking away our democracy

Rumour is that @realDonaldTrump has assaulted an other wife.
@realDonaldTrump is such a pitiful little man child. He can't handle facts, so he makes up fiction. He is mentally unable to be a real man, let alone the President

It's #PrideMonth , and can I just say how unsurprising it it is that @realDonaldTrump hasn't mentioned it? He's talked about loads of other things, but I guess that us LGBTQ+ people aren't important enough to him. Whatever. I don't want his approval.
American kids are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as kids in Germany and more than five times as likely to live in poverty as kids in Denmark. We have a childhood poverty crisis in our country and @realDonaldTrump is doing nothing to stop it.

Hell yes. They impeached him for a blowjob. @realDonaldTrump sold the country to Russia for a few lousy billion rubles and congress acts like nothing happened.
More important-what kind of husband DOESNT go to hospital WHILE his wife is having surgery-start to finish?! @realDonaldTrump said he spoke w/her morning of surgery&went to see her in the afternoon.He's pathetic. @BarackObama would be been front&center if it was @MichelleObama
Here's hoping that @FLOTUS may just be in Witness Protection in exchange for turning on @realDonaldTrump . #WheresFLOTUS
Probably because @realDonaldTrump is still extremely relevant and #JoyAnnReid isn't.

@realDonaldTrump Get rid of Soros. He is committing economic terrorism. He and his son should be stripped of their citizenship and imprisoned. For the sake of our country.
The president @realDonaldTrump and @EPAScottPruitt are subsidizing the end of the fucking earth.

Any questions Mueller has for Trump, he already has the answers to. He has carte blanche to ask anything his free range investigation desires. As he already has entrapped the others on non-related Russia issues. Don't drink the Kool-Aid @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump must be a terrible President to get the Black unemployment figures so low, I mean, Obama did far batter ... oh, wait ...
Why would they impeach President @realDonaldTrump ? The fact is, there should never have been an investigation on the campaign in the first place! Perhaps a couple individuals required scrutiny, but there was no collusion. This crap must end, or it will carry over in perpetuity!
