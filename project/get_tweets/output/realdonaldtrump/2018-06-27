Dear @realDonaldTrump Can you convince the GOP to pass a bill to get rid of FATCA already? I'm sick of filing IRS forms despite not living in the US. Rand Paul addressed this last year but didn't convince anyone, so can you address this? Oh and pardon Martin Shkreli too
Don't worry! @TheDemocrats only needs to put a person in your campaign brochure - @realDonaldTrump who is basically a RACIST. Plus you guys have @SteveKingIA @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan as the backup poster boys and the list goes on... all anti-women/LGBTQ and racists!
You think summer's gonna suck, what about the fall? -the fall of the @HouseGOP -the fall of the @SenateGOP -the fall of @realDonaldTrump Like you said, up to the voters to decide.

@realDonaldTrump Okay, we heard that Bill Shine is being considered for communication director in your administration . . . will he pass the #MAGA sniff test?
@realDonaldTrump will get tips on being a cruel dictator from Putin at the summit.

@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr you've made a deal with the devil. You have sold out this country. @realDonaldTrump will turn on you too. You have no conscious, you have no soul. How do you look at yourself and your kids? You're horrible people.

Wonder why in Twitter all we hear is liberal actors and politicians against Trump and the unlawful democratics @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @LouDobbs

Abolishing #SCOTUS and a third of the government along with it is how you damage the system of checks and balances in place. If the left is so worried about @realDonaldTrump becoming an authoritarian ruler then this is the OPPOSITE of what they would want #SaveSCOTUS

. @adamputnam We held our nose and voted for @marcorubio because @realDonaldTrump asked us to - Adam Putnam has his finger on the pulse of FL. @HickoryStonewal Ron DeSantis represents 1 district in FL - Adam Putnam knows the entire state! VOTE PUTNAM!!!!

@realDonaldTrump should add him to the list just piss off the left. Ruth Ginsberg would either drop dead on the spot or become a @TedNugent fan. I can see her riding in the back of his truck on a rocking chair like Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies.
Well I have to take a break from Twitter. Time to get the popcorn in the soft drink and watch @realDonaldTrump insult the libtards in the fake news. Be back in about an hour

Putin orders @realDonaldTrump to set up a meeting so he can get a report on the destruction of America and Europe. Of course our Puppet President bends the knee for his master.
