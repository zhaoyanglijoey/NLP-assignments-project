Vox Populi... Thank you @realDonaldTrump for bringing order, freedom and law back to America, I pray that you help it spread to the shores of the formerly Great Britain. We have a fake conservative government that is screwing the UK to gain favour with the EUSSR. Help
@realDonaldTrump I love you Trump but I will call you out on mistakes. Get rid of tariffs going both ways they hurt America. We don't need any at all. How about free trade? The government will get it on the back in from sales and income tax.
@realDonaldTrump hurting the people that voted for him most. Just as predicted. People - STOP voting against your best interests. You've got your damn SCOTUS picks, now there is ZERO excuse to vote for this man again.
#RT @realDonaldTrump : Today, it was my great honor to be in Kansas City, Missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make FREEDOM possible! Thank you @VFWHQ ! #VFWConvention pic.twitter.com/xigF1Laq1c
@realDonaldTrump Donald (TheCriminal)Trump is a disgusting human he cheated on Melania before during and after his child was born!!!!This guy has no principles no morals his God is money !!! What a peice of shit !!!
#RT @realDonaldTrump : On the heels of the VERY successful launch of the @WhiteHouse National Council for the American Worker, Congress should reauthorize #PerkinsCTE and ensure the American workforce remains stronger than EVER! #Jobs #Workforce
disgusting coward. How dare he turn a day for praising veterans into a @realDonaldTrump rally pic.twitter.com/DPq4q2s4u5
I enjoyed my dream about you @realDonaldTrump taking me for a meal on your hot air balloon with the Algerian president. His match attacks demonstration was a joy to behold, but your wife was slightly absent.

Did they tell @realDonaldTrump yet it did his advisors turn off @FoxNews to spare him the shame of being played for his weakness.
@realDonaldTrump You're a disgusting human being and we can't wait until your impeachment. YOU ARE A GODDAMNED TRAITOR TO THIS COUNTRY. We're not all stupid like your bass. Idiots.
@realDonaldTrump Moving some troops from Germany to Poland seems like a good plan; leverage against Germany, Russia, the Criticizing Dems & acknowledging Poland giving 2%; +Germany doesn't need the $ we spend for our troops being there all of these years & buy energy from Russia
It doesn't matter if it happened under Obama, Bush, Clinton, we need immigration reform that protects the children. Long prison terms to sexual abuse traffickers, rapists, and murderers. I hope @realDonaldTrump helps the suffering.
Pres. @realDonaldTrump do you have to say anything to the Pakistani citizens on #PakistanElections2018 happening today? #PakistanDecides2018 #PakistanElection2018
Tweeting the Pres of Iran in all caps is not standing up for America. It's acting like a dick. (Any middle school boy can do that.) If @realDonaldTrump really wanted to "stand up for America" he would've served his country instead of dodging the draft. #Trump #CadetBoneSpurs
Sends shivers up my spine. I can't even imagine what the Country would be like if "she" won. Thank God every day for @realDonaldTrump
Some people are Sooooo Gullible! @realDonaldTrump is still a Fake & a #ConMan ! pic.twitter.com/oApjeSXZwG
What saddens me and perhaps everyone with a heart and memories of loved ones who served in the wars past is @realDonaldTrump just doesn't give a damn about what they faught for. He is about aggrandizing himself his family at the expense of the USA values thier blood enshrined.
And, @realDonaldTrump , please sit for Robert Mueller, you may unknowingly have some small tidbit of information that could break the case wide open. If you're a patriot and love the flag, it's the least you can do for our country. ALSO, tell your pal to cut it out!!! ON TV, NOW.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Sir, It is quite remarkable that you are able to be so kind and caring to our military veterans, while being constantly attacked by the left. I am proud we have such a wonderful @POTUS , finally. Thank you
@realDonaldTrump is like that fucker you bump into at a bar who keeps telling you he knows best, but in reality you're just wanting the nutjob to fuck off home and get away from you. How is this bellend in charge of a county when he couldn't be in charge of cleaning a toilet
@realDonaldTrump Where's my bailout? Asking for everyone who's not a 1%er or a farmer.

@realDonaldTrump , Mr. #President , the Speaker of the House of Representatives, @PRyan is ABSOLUTELY THE LOWEST OF THE LOW! The very day he is no longer in office, his security clearance should be canceled RIGHT THEN AND THERE! @PRyan is TRASH in my book. #UNAMERICAN !

Every day that @realDonaldTrump is @POTUS and further harms America, I am ashamed to be an American. #MAGA by getting rid of the POS plague on the US which is #Trump .
Q posted "Sea to Shining Sea" before @realDonaldTrump took the stage at the VFW Nat'l Convention where Lee Greenwood sang "sea to shing sea" (21:33) & our POTUS acted like he was conducting the song right as those words were sung! "Q marker"! http:// youtu.be/37RsefjejRo pic.twitter.com/wLF6pY83EA

@realDonaldTrump You seriously have no business referring to anyone as being "low IQ" when yours is in the double digits. @RepMaxineWaters & @NancyPelosi can both run circles around your fat ass, with intelligence, class & dignity - all of which you lack #LockTrumpUp
@realDonaldTrump Do you care so little about us and our national security that you would declassify such a sensitive document? It doesn't exonerate you of anything. pic.twitter.com/GFynXblqkE
@realDonaldTrump is so obvious with his dis information, lying, & desperate distractions. No one will forget the fool he made of himself In Helsinki. Or the children he kidnapped. #TrumpTreason @JillWineBanks @robreiner @SteveSchmidtSES @nickbatz
@realDonaldTrump So you are committing $12 Billion to help farmers who have been hurt by increased tariffs that were put in place because of the tariffs YOU imposed....
Doesn't matter. We have already decided who the next President will be @realDonaldTrump .
Ok ok ok, @realDonaldTrump , Pence said he was looking for you in the White House wiring closet.
Exclusive: @WhiteHouse stops announcing calls with foreign leaders, @WhiteHouse has not published a readout of a call between @realDonaldTrump and a world leader since mid-June. Great reporting @kaitlancollins !!! https:// cnn.it/2OeD3aH

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump knows how to respect veterans, something Barack Obama never did: Watch as Trump Brings 94-Year-Old Veteran to the Podium. https:// tiny.iavian.net/nzlq
Oh, this lady knows how this is all connected. @GOP @NRA @realDonaldTrump Any comment, @DLoesch ?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President since you are looking at canceling the security clearance on those 5 or so Obama people you should also cancel HRC and Obama as well since they like to sell uranium to the Russians.
@realDonaldTrump - Ur ignorance is stunning. U dont know history. U dont understand even basic economics. U dont know how 2 behave in public. U babble & rant incoherently - leaving ppl wondering what exactly u were trying 2 say or if u r mentally deficient or just deranged. pic.twitter.com/rA9NBHHEqL
@realDonaldTrump I think it's time to put the boot in and revoke security clearance. No more Mr nice guy , release all redacted files and be transparent as you said you would.

I find @realDonaldTrump is more concerned with the media and what people think about him then his actual JOB because, this is obviously not his career. He would be better suited as an inmate. That's a good career choice for him.
FUN FACTS: @realDonaldTrump signed into law: -Marvin Gaye Post Office in L.A. -Tuskegee Airmen PO bldg in NYC -Lance Corporal Thomas Rivers Jr. PO in Birmingham
And here I was thinking @realDonaldTrump wanted to take us back to the 1850's.
@realDonaldTrump Do you mean the tape of Obama with more flexibility? Or the Uranium we sold them? Or the Redline! Little Chuck
@realDonaldTrump OBAMA SPIED ON FOX NEWS TOO! FOX has been talking about how corrupt Muslim Obama, Dems/Rinos spied on President Trump & his team. Would anyone be surprised if EVERYONE WORKING AT FOX had their phones and computers wire tapped also? Juan Williams is spying on FOX!
I'm sorry @newtgingrich I just can't get over the way you tossed @realDonaldTrump under the bus the other day. I am going to have to unfollow you. I get mad every time I see your phoniness.
@realDonaldTrump ...as my President, it is sad that you don't think my country is great. It is true that the country has become a racist, partisan shitte hole since you have become the leader.
@realDonaldTrump You just LIE.
@realDonaldTrump : Our Country is doing GREAT. Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN!
