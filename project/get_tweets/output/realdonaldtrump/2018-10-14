@60Minutes Dear God, @realDonaldTrump is "blaming" himself for having such a strong economy ...
President @realDonaldTrump is owning Leslie Stahl and this hit piece by 60 Minutes.
. @CBSNews is getting schooled by @realDonaldTrump - they're attacking nonstop, and Trump is parrying and pushing back. Lesley Stahl and the rest of the 60 Minutes are out of their league. 2 years in and they're still underestimating the man.
This @60Minutes piece with @realDonaldTrump is hysterical. You won but everything #Liberals believe in is more important. Do what we want. Wah wah wah. Politics is vicious, deceptive.
@60Minutes your reporter, Leslie Stahl, is very disrespectful to our POTUS! Reporters are supposed to be bias, not shove their opinion down our throats. Face it @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is doing a great job and I WILL vote Trump again. Thank you @realDonaldTrump @POTUS .

"I'm not gonna ask it again." - @60Minutes ' @LesleyStahl , deciding to give up rather than press @realDonaldTrump for a very simple answer.
@CBS @60Minutes @realDonaldTrump I'm watching your show, by accident, and I am reminded of why I stopped. Your host questioning POTUS exudes smug elitism, and keeps interrupting POTUS when he's trying to answer. Seems more an attack than an interview. You guys are out of touch.
. @realDonaldTrump Just wondering how your latest golf outing went? -- asking for a friend whose internet is out (and who doesn't have electricity, food, water... No! Not Puerto Rico, silly! She's in Florida. Ya, I know. Sucks to be them, eh? Lol, you's cray-cray!)
I would almost rather listen to 1 hour of Kelly Clarkson, than listen to Lesley Stahl on @60Minutes rn. Werk @realDonaldTrump
President @realDonaldTrump is correct that actions have consequences and if you come into the US illegally you have broken our law and there are CONSEQUENCES otherwise our laws are USELESS!!! @60Minutes
No matter how much she interrupts, @realDonaldTrump is in control !!
@realDonaldTrump I love this President! He loves America. He is taking care of me and my family. Liberal people like @60Minutes hates America. Liberalism is evil.
Do you really think @realDonaldTrump has evaded taxes - a billionaire? They would have got him for it long ago. What a waste of time and money that could be spent and used for humanitarian purposes. I thought more of Ron Howard than that. Sad.

Why does that blonde woman on . @CBSNews #60Minutes keep interrupting @realDonaldTrump ? He's too smart for you, lady.
@60Minutes This is the most biased and jarring interview I've watched in ages. The amount of constant editing and negative persuasion is extremely unprofessional. As an independent voter, I will remember this during the next election. @realDonaldTrump @ScottAdamsSays
To be fair, @realDonaldTrump has always been a horrible human being, a pathological-liar, corrupt, racist and an embarrassment to his father. It didn't start when he became @POTUS or enter the @WhiteHouse .
@CBSNews is so disgustingly weak. Get on @realDonaldTrump 's level, jeez. #KAGForever #MAGAWinning #MTWGA

@60Minutes Leslie, have you considered letting @realDonaldTrump answer a question without interrupting him?
@realDonaldTrump ANSWER THE QUESTION! Are you going to separate children from their parents?! #humanity
@realDonaldTrump doesn't want to be president, he thinks he is king. Being led by a king away or a king at home, is still being led.
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes So this president thinks that the press is treating him badly...this from the sitting president who calls people names, vilifies anyone that disagrees with him. This from a president that holds narcissist rallies with angry mobs!?!?
Waiting to see if Stahl of 60 minutes gives @realDonaldTrump kudos for the economy in second half. No bias there! #FakeNews
@realDonaldTrump go fuck yourself, traitor. #60Minutes
@realDonaldTrump is so very, very arrogant

@LesleyRStahl What a disrespectful interview with @realDonaldTrump on @60Minutes . Imagine if reporters took the same tone with @BarackObama . You conducted an interrogation, not an interview. This is shameful and irresponsible bias.
I love what @realDonaldTrump is doing. Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, de regulation, tax cuts, all are real change that build a stronger country. Obungler was a joke, a poseur, who damaged the country.
Did Lesley Stahl ever grilled @BarackObama like she's doing to @realDonaldTrump ? Yeah I didn't think so either. #DoubleStandards #60Mins

@realDonaldTrump watching you get interviewed on 60 mins is hilarious. You are so stupid lmao.
I can't believe such a seasoned newswoman as Lesley Stahl is giving such a terrible accounting of herself, in the interview with @realDonaldTrump . The questions are too cute by half, biased in tone and insulting.. to her.

@realDonaldTrump American hospitality industry needs to catch up with wages since everything else has.people will continue to eat out but restaurant owners are the ones reaping the benefits while keeping wages stagnated to be in compliance with minimum wage laws

Is it me, or is Leslie Stahl of #60minutes just rude to @realDonaldTrump ? Talk about having an agenda.
@60Minutes , @realDonaldTrump ; LESLIE STAHL was profoundly NEGLIGENT in preparing for the KIND OF QUESTIONS she commanded Trump answer.I DEMAND CBS+Stahl read Toffler "Power Shift"1990; REVIEW anti-compet TRADE restrictions "PURITY+SOURCE ORIG" LAWS&Anti GMO. Toffler battle Intel
Watching the 60 Minutes interview with @realDonaldTrump and I'm am disgusted with Lesley Stahl and CBS. Totally biased and disrespectful.
@LesleyRStahl @CBS I am extremely disappointed to see that you create your spin of the conversation after the camera is off of the President to fit your negative narrative on 60 minutes. Fake News is real and you are adding to it! Shameful and disgusting!! @realDonaldTrump
Have you ever seen a sitting US President treated so disrespectfully during an interview on @60Minutes , or any other program? @realDonaldTrump shouldn't give them the ratings bump. @LesleyRStahl is a hack. #60Minutes
