Mr President...have you not contacted National Hero James Shaw Jr. because you are a coward and you find it hard to speak to a real man? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump

Rudy Giuliani is so narcissistic ; I think if @LesterHoltNBC interviewed Rudy , Mueller would have enough 2 indict @realDonaldTrump !
Brad Stevens timeouts are like @realDonaldTrump economy. Unbelievable. Unstoppable. Brilliant.
@SenJohnMcCain confidants told the White House that @realDonaldTrump not invited to his funeral. I am starting to think #Trump is really an @TeaPartyOrg backer! Too many politicians @#WashDC having temper-tantrums like this to not think its possible https:// washex.am/2KErTdl
Good bye @FLOTUS . Your husband @realDonaldTrump has been cheating on you since the beginning of time. So SHUT up!
Me too... how about @realDonaldTrump ? Do your bone spurs prevent you from riding a bike too, old ma?
Whos the proven LIAR???? Thats right, its @realDonaldTrump
Amen! Thank GOD for President Trump! God protect him & give him the wisdom to right the ship we call home! The GREATEST NATION IN THE & may he be able to #UniteTheMasses to #KAG God Bless @realDonaldTrump & his family! PS: Re- #ObamaGate #LockThemAllUp S N! Please.
The President of the United States of America, @realDonaldTrump hates women. He probably also hates corgi puppies. #POTUS #realDonaldTrump #WOMEN #Corgi #CincoDeMayo #CincoDeMayoFunFacts
@realDonaldTrump White European American children are being bullied by blacks/browns at Schools as they are envious of Euro Americans high average iq and high inventiveness! Black/browns have no self control and have higher testosterone causing violence!
Who would?! After @realDonaldTrump disrespected a true hero; #Trump who never served a day in his life. Lied and cheated his way out of serving in the military- just like everything else.
I don't think you fully understand what @realDonaldTrump really said. He clmed that USA gave a billion dolars to Nigeria in aid without giving the time frame withn which that said amount is givn. We dn't know whether it was this yr, last yr or even within the last 10, 20 yrs ago.

And I would to say @realDonaldTrump "F you for screwing me by eliminating and changing the exemptions. I'm F'd next year. So, screw. You."
Ya, let me add mt 'thanks' too to the dirtbag for screwing up our country. @realDonaldTrump
Yo @realDonaldTrump you ever been so hungry you barebacked a Big Mac?
And I suppose this absolves @realDonaldTrump for cheating on his first wife, cheating on his second wife and cheating on his third wife @MELANIATRUMP . It's called #Adultery , Franklin, and the fact that you turn a blind eye to this shows what kind of #FakeChristian you are.
I got that long ago, no one listens. Stupidly trusting Mueller to be honest. Not with the Democrats, he put in place, they all hate @realDonaldTrump . Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Sidney Powell believes Special Counsel Robert Mueller is guilty of prosecutorial improprieties.
@SenJohnMcCain to @realDonaldTrump You dont fire me, I quit
The song 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' has been President @realDonaldTrump theme song from his campaigning days. I watch all his speeches and that song is played every time.
Now we know why @realDonaldTrump is dismantling the State Department. A "dirty ops" firm--at taxpayer expense--is taking over international relations for the U.S.
CNN bitches about everything! @realDonaldTrump

I am waiting for apologies from @realDonaldTrump after his horrible and inacceptable statement about French victims in Paris attacks in 2015. We respect our victims.

And yet @realDonaldTrump and @vp can't take time from their reelection campaign to thank a black man without a gun.
Could direct tweet this to @realDonaldTrump sir? Thank you.
Surely,Mr.Karczewski is just like you:white+patriot. But: what's the source of your info that the Speaker of the Polish Senate is a holocaust denier? An anti-Semite? Maybe @realDonaldTrump wishes to explain it to 10 000 000 Polish Americans and to the 40 mil Poles in Europe?
@SpeakerRyan should take inspiration from @SenJohnMcCain and have the strength to ostracize @realDonaldTrump for the degenerate and psychopathic he really is.
For qualified lawyer, the former New York City Governor #RudyGiuliani has very loose tongue & @realDonaldTrump may never invite him back to @WhiteHouse again!
@realDonaldTrump James Shaw Jr. stopped a crazy man from killing more. Hawaii has suffered a 6.9 earthquake. Puerto Rico is still without power in many areas. You have time to tweet about Kanya and your "witch hunt" but nothing about James, Hawaii or Puerto Rico. SHAME.

@realDonaldTrump is going to spend $30 million on a "Military Parade" Every dollar of that money could be better spent elsewhere. Feeding/housing our homeless veterans, CHIP, education or our infrastructure. Let's call this #MilitaryParade what it really is. A waste for his ego
@realDonaldTrump
Why the hell should it wrap up if the tangled web that @realDonaldTrump has woven implicates so many others that information has to be obtained there too?
I really feel sorry for General Flynn but he worked for Obama (the biggest mistake of his life) as his director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and would have been considered a traitor to the Obama administration when @realDonaldTrump selected him
@realDonaldTrump So, its been almost 2 weeks and still no tweet honoring James Shaw jr. Why? See ev1 your potus is a racist,
@realDonaldTrump . Kerry sneaking & working w/Iran to thwart Trump, & save his nuke deal. Kerry working w/world leaders to undermine U.S foreign policy & try to salvage Iran deal. N shadow diplomacy w/a top-ranking Iranian official. Logan Act Guantanamo Bay
@realDonaldTrump when will ANYONE, I MEAN ANYONE, in government that has committed a crime be prosecuted?

@realDonaldTrump POTUS.. how does clapper, Comey and others still have Security clearance. Have them striped of security clearance immediately. And fire Rosenstein immediately. He challenged u and Congress
@realDonaldTrump Unseal his records. People deserve to know what he has been hiding.
@realDonaldTrump I'm on a mission BITCH
Why are you in such a hurry? Afraid to have proof @realDonaldTrump is the crook we all knew him to be?
Don't forget "Trump" isn't his real name either. Everything about @realDonaldTrump has proven to be immoral, low rent, white trash. He steps on everyone, regardless of if they kiss his ring.
OBAMA HELD THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 8yrs, CAME FROM CHICAGO, YET, THE GUN-FREE CITY KNOWN AS CHICAGO, IN THAT 8yrs BECAME THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD WITH MORE GUN DEATHS THAN AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ (TWO NATIONS IN WAR) & YET . @realDonaldTrump IS THE "BAD GUY". KEEP EXPOSING YOURSELF

Was Sater passing a message from @TomArnold to @realDonaldTrump ?
I thought @realDonaldTrump would be our worst president yet and he is! He's even worse than I thought he would be.
Where is everyo es concerns about all the Dems and their SLUSH FUND? How barry sent millions to terrorists, how billy & hilly have assaulted women, first by billy then verbally from hilly. @realDonaldTrump is not doing any of this!! #MAGA

I am with you! As a Latina @realDonaldTrump supporter from day one, I do not support cruelty of any kind. We cannot forget the wonderful attributes and work ethics of immigrants. #CincoDeMayo
@realDonaldTrump keep doing a great job. Unemployment is under 4% the lowest in over 15 years!
Jerome Corsi is a fraud all his life. I tried verifying his claim that he knows Trump for nearly 40 yrs. But in the alleged 3 decades of "friendship", NO picture of Corsi & @potus @realDonaldTrump at all. How could that be? Trump took pics with practically everyone. #Qanon #moab
We may have to close up your mouth!! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @JY_LeDrian which is why the USA IS freedom and France has to continually be bailed out to KEEP their freedom. There is a reason our two countries are so different and why twice now we have had to solve France's problems (ww I&II) Stop with the anti gun crap
Why in the world, would @realdonaldtrump and his @GOP be trying to fire any Republican investigating this administration, if these Republicans weren't actually doing their job? Oh wait, it's called OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE! #Resistance
. @isaaclarian is the idea of "no news is good news" in play here, or have I missed the announcement that TRU shot down your bid again? #SaveToysRUs . @realDonaldTrump #33000storeEmployees and how many support staff will be #OutOfWork at the end of this? #screwbain

@realDonaldTrump ....salvage the Iran deal. Engaging in unusual shadow diplomacy with a top-ranking Iranian official.
@realDonaldTrump should spend some time with this guy, maybe something will rub off, like improved character, humility, etc..
@realDonaldTrump " I actually believe in my heart that the democrats and the progressives knew that a tax cut, deregulation and better trade deals would make Americans better off. They have done everything they can to keep Americans from having it. Why?
