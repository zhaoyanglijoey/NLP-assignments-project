@realDonaldTrump You have lacked an #Auriga for far too long. Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris. #notsoonenough
@realDonaldTrump doesn't speak for MOST of us! Kavanaugh* doesn't deserve an apology, EVER!!! And, HE should be apologizing to his family for what HE put them through!!! #vote #MeToo #VoteBlue #Kavanaugh
This is why I will never vote Dem @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/IGb4KPYRWu
Trump knows how it feels, accused of rape/sexual assault 16 times, including one 13-year-old, Trump identifies with KKK Kavanaugh. @realDonaldTrump really did say this to Howard Stern, Trump called Howard during the 2016 campaign begging him to take the interview from his website pic.twitter.com/e8nfQ4F4Ei
Because America is trash! Why you would send someone off to fight and possibly die for your nonsense and not look after them once they did the work. Any decent mobster looks after its people in prison and when they get back out. @realDonaldTrump where are ya Mr U!S!A!

Also, @BrettKavanaugh , @realDonaldTrump does not speak for me and I do not apologize. Not at all and not for one moment. #ImpeachKavanaugh
@realDonaldTrump is good at wasting other people's money.
Also at @VP When are you and @realDonaldTrump realdgoing to do something about all the #FakeNewsMedia outlets spreading Lies & misinformation colluding with foreign Nationals to bring about the collapse of the United States of America they all need to be accountable.!! #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump you do NOT speak for me. Ever.
When is @realDonaldTrump going to apologize to @BarackObama and the family of @SenJohnMcCain
Wow, you've got a thing for rape. @BillClinton had issues with sexual behavior just like @BretKavarnaugh , @realDonaldTrump , etc, the difference is while the rest of the world is trying to make up for how we handled sexual assault, the @GOP is embracing it as their platform.
@realDonaldTrump is POTUS. He speaks for the country whether or not you like it or agree. #Kavenaugh is on the bench. #getoverit
@realDonaldTrump hey, take a look at yourself!
of course @realDonaldTrump would aplogize to the assaulter vs the assaultee
Thank you President Trump. Congratulations Justice Kavanaugh!! God Bless you and your family. @realDonaldTrump @BrettKavanaugh #GODBLESSAMERICA #VoteRedToSaveAmerica pic.twitter.com/wkFMD9JhQg
@realDonaldTrump ur one big eye roll. Sad!
Sleepin' Joe Donnelly says he works for Hoosiers, but the only thing he's done is ship their jobs to Mexico. @braun4indiana brought the heat tonight, and @realDonaldTrump needs you to send him to the Senate! #INSen #IBackBraun http:// gop.cm/6182r71IE
@realDonaldTrump Orange Jerkoff says Trump was "proven innocent." That isn't even a thing...and this was not a trial. If it was a trial, there were only two outcomes possible: Guilty or Not Guilty. "Innocent" is not part of the legal process.
And THIS is why I can't stand the "tolerant" scum bag Democrats. Lmao. This response was all because I said it's her word vs his. Lol @dbongino @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/cZeHyCPfPL
I wouldn't wear this shirt with YOUR body! LOL! Once again KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE!

Lisa I have to re-like many of yours and @realDonaldTrump all the time.
Guilt is a powerful emotion, it is faithful it is relentlessly persistent, #Kavanaugh will be tortured for his repulsive behavior for the rest of his pathetic life. @realDonaldTrump so will you.
Thanks To @realDonaldTrump And Brett Kavanaugh Rape And Sexual Assault Are Legal In America! Rape Away America Rape Away
Just checkin' in on my favorite high cheek-boned Indian! What's going on in Pocahontas' neck of the woods? @realDonaldTrump
#Kavanaugh Congratulations to Mr Brett Kavanaugh There is NO EVIDENCE to support the lurid claims made against him It is RIGHT that the presumption of innocence, a cornerstone of our Western democracies, has won the day @realDonaldTrump is RIGHT to apologise for pain caused
Words fail me. All I think of when watching this video is that @realDonaldTrump would find a way to mock these brave people and that angers me to no end.
Chrissy Ford is a calculating political psychopath. She MUST be held accountable for perjury. Or, once again the @gop message will be: @dnc can get away with anything! @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @parscale @realDonaldTrump #maga
Hey, u fucking asshole in the WH, you DO NOT speak for me. Kava-No does not get an apology from me. He gets a warning. There will be more coming out. The truth always comes out & it will PROVE u are both the disgusting pigs we know u both to be. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump on behalf of 35% of our nation Don The other 65% thinks he is guilty as Fu<~#^%ck!! #DonTheCon
@realDonaldTrump Do not apologize for me regarding "Kavanaught." Neither of you deserve to be in your position

@realDonaldTrump IS A LIAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Apparently, @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr and basically the whole GOP thinks they can convince others that half of American citizens are a "mob", because we don't agree with their attacks on civil rights. So tonight, I am going to post a few things just from the FIRST year.
YOU do NOT apologize in my name to Kavanaugh. You had a chance to clear his name of sexual assault charges but chose NOT to interview the victims. AFRAID to find out the truth of course. HOW DARE you call it a HOAX!! You, sir, are a vile liar. @realDonaldTrump
People actually believe @realDonaldTrump gives money to #Vets ??? All he does is belittle #POWs , #Active and #MilitaryRetirees ! Lol, omg, @GOP is gullible! #BiasConfirmationNews
Dems received a very well deserved slap upside the head for bastardizing the Judicial Nomination process from @realDonaldTrump . Kavanaugh was pure class. #HimToo
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @taylorswift13 UNPATRIOTIC UNAMERICAN TREASONOUS TRAITOR, it is called the 1st Amendment Taylor Swift is an American citizen she has the right to her opinion and she has the right freedom to post whatever she wants about the Senate race. #VoteBlue
@realDonaldTrump You speak only for Deplorables & you should only speak for Deplorables. #BrettKavanaugh is a sexual predator. He's an even worse disgrace than #ClarenceThomas .
He is a neocon and enemy of @realDonaldTrump . He has been trying to undermine him since day one.
@realDonaldTrump -- Kavanaugh wasn't proven innocent -- he got away with it -- now you sexual assaulters can compare notes on how to mistreat women ...
@realDonaldTrump you dont speak for me.
The one issue with this notion is that @realDonaldTrump can only survive if he brings everyone down a few notches to his level and/or divides and conquers. The man has zero consensus building skills and lacks an understanding of the larger global community.
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @SenMajLdr @BrettKavanaugh How date U 3 call American people protesting in civil manner, which Every American Citizen has a right 2 do, a mob. The real mob has been the Repubs who have decided 2 shove a alleged attempted rapist down the throat
Don Jr Braun in Indiana needs your help. His debate with Donnelly was average at best please come to Indiana and carry Braun over the line!! . @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump How bigly of u to want to apologize to BK for all the exposure he received.Have u apologized to all the incarcerated children whom u separated from their parents.Are u at least working on it? We cannot go on with a traitorous prez and a tainted SC. #Impeach
Thank @realDonaldTrump so much on behalf of me and all Americans to apologize to Justice @BrettKavanaugh and his family.
Loved what @realDonaldTrump said to Justice #BrettKavanaugh on behalf of America! It was emotional to watch his speech after what he went through. Despicable @SenateDems deserve the #RedWave2018 they strengthened. #WalkAwayCampaign

He's the SCUM UNDER MY SHOE @REALDONALDTRUMP
@realDonaldTrump You're not apologizing on behalf of me.
At the expense of tribal economies, this is wrong. If he's too unethical for @realDonaldTrump administration, obviously he's too extreme for #NM #nmpol
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #qanon Ughhhhh. PLEASE unseal the indictments and let the evil be dealt with.
Not so fast @POTUS @realDonaldTrump . #Kavanaugh isn't the only person who had "terrible pain and suffering," but he cries and rants well. Thought #Trump doesn't like criers? Ha! #MAGA #KavanaughHearings
@realDonaldTrump You make me puke.
@realDonaldTrump COUNTING THE DAYS UNTIL YOUR FACE IS NEVER SEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN
Charges would not have been filed if she killed this man. Trump helped these hateful people find their voice again. Those of us who are actually living through scary times have no sympathy for entitled bigots like @realDonaldTrump or his cult followers.

@realDonaldTrump Trumpo The Democrats have become liberals in the last 10 years therefore negative issues is that the top of their list. These are not positive people they never will be.Most of them probably had trouble in their younger years either bullied and picked on
Republicans are hypoticial liars, tougher, meaner, more cynical, and more ruthless than Democrats. Who wants the Nazi party in control? Not us or the Democrats. Republicans are the Nazis and Trump is Hitler to their followers. https:// buff.ly/2E6G9MR @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
You should make your first tweet a good one. How's this. @realDonaldTrump , don't ever apologize to someone on my behalf again.

@realdonaldtrump So funny that Taylor Swift got to you!!!! LOL!!
Disgraceful! Our chance to show @realDonaldTrump that he does not speak for the nation is almost here. We now have an accused attempted rapist on the Supreme Court.
I just got back from Goodwill & there were at least a dozen Mexicans shopping & I didn't hear any of them speak one word of English. Our country is being transformed right before our very eyes. #BuildTheWall @realDonaldTrump !!!
Its unbelievable how @realDonaldTrump supporters don't see the irony when they say "Celebrities need to stay out of politics!"especially when it comes to #Liberal celebs. This from ppl who elected a reality TV host to be #POTUS ! But please do demonstrate more of your hypocrisy !
I thought @realDonaldTrump might leave him in Florida

@realDonaldTrump We need a law that says that every immigrant who arrives in this country, whether for asylum, refuge or family reunification if found guilty and recidivist in any crime or illegal activity should be deported.
@joanwalsh Is there anything that @realDonaldTrump can do to have you say something nice about him or what he does? I'm sure you noticed that Associate Justice Kavanuagh had his family and friends with him the entire way. Dr. Fraud was by herself, no family or friends by her side
Great idea New TV Show. Doogie Howser MD starring Neil Patrick Harris. Tag line, he is such a good doctor surgeon he solves medical problems on other TV shows. @ActuallyNPH @AynRandInst @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SidneyPowell1 @TheFive @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter

@realDonaldTrump called us the "Party of Crime" which is God damn ridiculous! We use our 1st Amendment right...which is guaranteed to us! He also referred to the accusations against #Kavanaugh as a hoax, of course after mocking Dr. Ford. The time is now! We must rally & end this!

@realDonaldTrump Florida specifically Miami has many Cuban immigrants who commit fraud with the benefits that are granted. This has been for years and will continue if you do not stop that theft.
In fact, all you have to do is remove California and . @realDonaldTrump won by over 1 million votes.
Hey @realDonaldTrump do not apologize for me. You do not speak for me.
The entire GOP Congress now has assumed psycho attributions in that they are PROJECTING everything they are doing on to the democrats--following der leader @realDonaldTrump WHOSE SERIOUS ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER results in his constant combo of grievance/projection rants.
The angry mob was seen in Charlottesville carrying torches and is responsible for the death of one innocent woman. The very same people who @realDonaldTrump said are very fine people.
@realDonaldTrump DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR me nor for the millions of other Americans who know Kavanaugh has no BUSINESS being on the supreme court!
If there is no one more qualified then Kavanaugh @realDonaldTrump we are in big trouble , Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump you just bought yourself a judge

@realDonaldTrump Cuban immigrants continue to arrive every day, who are going to bleed our economic resources. How long will you allow that?
Right? As if @realDonaldTrump didn't say the #2ndAmendment could take care of @HillaryClinton if she won. If you think Democratic Senators, legislators & activists aren't getting death threats from the #Maga crowd daily, you've lost your mind.

@realDonaldTrump you do NOT speak on behalf of the nation! You speak on behalf of your base. The world I live in, people are angry as hell that you're tearing America apart. You love money and power, probably the only things you ever truly loved. I pity you. #sad
@realDonaldTrump wonderful speech tonight.
@realDonaldTrump Don't apologize to Brett Kavanaugh on my behalf, cuz i ain't saying it!!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe he is not going to fire him bc our President knows he, Rod, is going down for the political coup that is going on now and we know he is a big part of it. Firing him is not as dramatic as him being brought out in handcuffs.
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump With cousins like yours, who needs enemies? Next time look in the basement for documents forgotten and un-shredded!
Yeah.... and what is even more scary is she is a teacher....this is what's indoctrinating your kids in government schools with taxpayers dollars. Think about that. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you have no right to apologize to Kavanaugh on the nations behalf ... I do not apologize at all for what he & his family have gone through
@realDonaldTrump DO NOT apologize to Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation, you only speak for your kind! Not the rest of us!!
Watching @realDonaldTrump drool and slobber over spineless GOP leaders, Bret Kavanaugh wearing a pouty dog face (treated so unfairly) and then hearing trump lead a prayer~excuse me I just spit up in my mouth, reminds me that I need to take the trash out.Ashley (she forgets)
