@realDonaldTrump It is because of President Obama that the economy is so great, not you. Your fantasies are not reality, no matter how much you with that they were. Fox News is a format for those based in fantasy! They are all going to turn on you at once Donald!
So @realDonaldTrump promised #Mexico would pay for the wall and his trolls ate it up. Now #Trump says that unless the American tax payers foot the bill he'll shut down our government? Does that sound like #MAGA ? @VicenteFoxQue told us Mexico wasn't paying for that fucking wall!

@realDonaldTrump doesn't have the stamina to keep up with a 70 year old woman.

If @realDonaldTrump does a deal that does not secure the border with a wall, end chain and lottery migration before letting thr 800,000 DACA stay and become citizens, I am in favor of letting democrats impeach him even on made up charges!

Thank you President Fox.....well said! More current and former world leaders lining up in 'support' of @POTUS #Trump ! @realDonaldTrump = #loser
Far from being a jobs creator, given what's transpired at AT&T, Comcast & now Walmart, @realDonaldTrump is a proven jobs #loser . The #TrumpTaxCon wound up costing people their jobs. I feel sorry for Trump voters who bought into Trump's lies.
@realDonaldTrump You go Donald. We don't need to import more Welfare recipients. We have enough here we can't afford
Media freak out about @realDonaldTrump saying shithole countries, but silent about @Twitter trying to down rank shitty people. #ThursdayThoughts #ProjectVeritas #ShadowBan
To lead one needs a soul, to love one needs a heart - neither apply to @realDonaldTrump @cnnbrk @CBSNews @FoxNews @CraigColwell3
@realDonaldTrump Hey shithead, I've gotten to know many immigrants from Haiti and other places you talk shit about and they're good, hard-working people unlike you. Step the fuck down so we can make America great.
@realDonaldTrump is despicable. More despicable however are all those that support and enable this racist #SHITHOLEPRESIDENT
So . @realDonaldTrump want's immigrants from Norway. Guess who is shopping for the 4th Mrs. Donald Trump...
We'll be like a shining city upon a hill, one that all shithole countries can look up to and think bigly of - @realDonaldTrump

In non news, @realDonaldTrump is a racist sack of shit.
The Center For American Progress (a huge misnomer by the way) has sent all their paid trolls (employees) to SM to LIE about what the . @realDonaldTrump admin's proposed changes for #Medicaid are. Don't be fooled by their attempt to create mass hysteria over this. #FactsMatter
@realDonaldTrump the only real #shithole is in #NYC , and has your name on it.
#ShitholeCountries @realDonaldTrump people from Norway don't want to come to this #SHITHOLE . Scandenavian countries are Democratic Socialists and consistently ranked at the top of happiest countries in the world. Y would they want to come here 2 a system that's rigged for the 1%?
@realDonaldTrump You have to apologize fore "shithole countries." I am almost in tears. I have to go out and support you. Ask Franklin Graham if the people of Haiti and Africa are from shitholes. Ask Paula White about that attitude. I PRAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF HAITI EVERY TUESDAY.

The Twitter trend is summarized as @realDonaldTrump "says he'd prefer immigrants from Norway instead of Haiti or Africa." That's NOT why it's newsworthy and trending. It's because he called the latter countries "shitholes". Poor Twitter, always worried about its bottom line.

@realDonaldTrump IS a racist. his words and actions say so over and over again. The POTUS is held up to the highest standards and @realDonaldTrump has failed over and over again to achieve any semblance of decorum. He is completely unfit for office and in essence, so are you.
@realDonaldTrump says he wants immigrants from Norway, which is ironic considering they have a universal healthcare system that the @GOP hates so much.
"Kitchen table talk", "locker room talk", it's amazing how much of this talk @realDonaldTrump does considering that he's never in either position. Unfortunately this is not the normal "White House talk".

@realDonaldTrump Hey, we all think some countries are sh*tholes too. We are glad you said it! We don't want degenerates from those countries. Look what they are doing to Europe! Keep defending us!
Sad when you got a democrat like @SenatorDurbin who lied what @realDonaldTrump said;he is just another lier and one of the swamp idiots that needs to be forced out of senate by the voters;total jerk.

Hey @realDonaldTrump Russian hackers are now attempting to get into the US Senate email servers. Are you going to continue to ignore this invasion by a foreign government on our country? Or do they, perhaps, have your blessing?
Once again, @SpeakerRyan demonstrates that he had no balls! What @realDonaldTrump said needs to be condemned unconditionally. Unfortunately, it seems as if GOP leadership agrees with the crass and vulgar things Trump said. Trump is a racist & Ryan continues to protect/enable him.

Well, I'm counting the days. @realDonaldTrump seems to have ramped it up since you've been off air!
And yet, despite the possibility of it being any number of shithole countries, @realDonaldTrump hasn't yet authorized ANY kind of government cybersecurity initiative to protect us from this ACTUAL threat. I guess he thinks his wall would do that, too.

What happened today in #Hawaii was in no way @realDonaldTrump fault as #Liberals , #LiberalHollywood , & the #FakeNews media will tell you. Said he is taking too long. Trump has wanted to bomb #NorthKorea since his Fire and Fury comments in August. Media crucifies him.
@realDonaldTrump Your hate and racism is affecting the world. Mayor of London dealing with ignorant racists like you
@realDonaldTrump
@LGrantz3 @JimEAllen2 @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump President Trump The American People back you 100%. If you were not effective the Dems & lapdog media would not be freaking out. Keep Making America Great!
Had this false alert in Hawaii happened 2 yrs ago we would have been asking if the system was hacked instead of panicking. I blame @realDonaldTrump @POTUS . Are we great enough yet?!

@realDonaldTrump Dunno if you heard, but Hawaii is an island surrounded by waters...LOTS of water.....maybe you can arrange a summit meeting with the President of Hawaii to discuss things...
Please talk about an orther country like France Thank you I am so sad. @realDonaldTrump
Just add Hillary and Investigation in the same sentience. You guys have to get over your fantasy of seeing Hilary in stripes. #FreakyFetish Meanwhile, IN THE REAL WORLD, Mueller continues to get closer and closer to @realDonaldTrump #Indictments . http:// NeedToImpeach.com
"O beautiful for heroes proved In liberating strife, Who more than self their country loved And mercy more than life" cc @realDonaldTrump
#iranprotests I seen video where the Iranian government is publicly hanging protestors and the #liberals say nothing but if @realDonaldTrump supposedly says SH*T hole, then that is the BIG DEAL for @CNN !
At this point, does anyone else think we'd be better off with no President at all than with @realDonaldTrump ?
If he is your president, than you can keep him. The same people want someone else. And, how can you claim to love god and be a @realDonaldTrump supporter. The two are mutually exclusive!
@realDonaldTrump Father was at KKK meeting 1927 and trump also associated ? Seems the KLKK Rubs off on President who never told anyone He is German based by father & family Line although mother was Scottish ?
@realDonaldTrump has done somethin right! He has shown what a Racist &ugly racism looks like so that every1 can c racism's ugly face. When u c ppl fm other races comdemin him 4his vile &racist remarks then u NO th country is united n its stand against divisiveness hatred &racism.
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @foxandfriends @washingtonpost Please ,continue to act like the Dumbass that 4/5 of the USA and the rest of the WORLD knows you truly are! The more stupid dumbshit you say and do, the quicker we will be done with the Idiot-In-Chief, known as "The Dump"!
Any word on the missile threat in Hawaii? No? @realDonaldTrump
Stormy day in Twitter and for @realDonaldTrump
Inaction is the wrong action. It's time for a different strategy, as @realDonaldTrump stated.
What if WE ALL BLOCKED @realDonaldTrump ?!?! It would be so great to see him responding to MOST of the #FREEWORLD blocking him?!?! Who's with me?!?! #blocked #ResistanceUnited #blockchain #AMJoy #stablegenius #PoS #INSTABLOCK #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #ShutUpTrump #FBRParty #FBR
We have to take #FireAndFury w/ healthy skepticism but it's revealing that @MichaelWolffNYC said to @donlemon on CNN that @realDonaldTrump constantly repeats himself. Trump says the book is fake & yet he tweets almost the exact same rant an hour apart. Truth always finds its way pic.twitter.com/Ml0ITJoOAR
But in this case it is being led by another self proclaimed genius (following in hitlers footsteps) @realDonaldTrump "tiny" our fake president...
#LeakerSaysWhat ? @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec
@SenSasse Do you mock the disabled? Think @SenatorJohnMcCain isn't a hero because he was captured? Haiti, El Salvador, & African nations are shitholes? There are some very fine people among white supremacists? Stand with @realDonaldTrump ? Have you no decency? #NeedtoImpeach
@realDonaldTrump @VP @Douglas_Collins 1 week from 1 year...Thank you Mr President, I can feel our country making progress & gaining respect. Keep tweeting for the media garners no trust. Keep speaking the truth they try to silence or twist. God bless you
& when @realDonaldTrump makes a statement, will you be mad at the governor of HI? Because that's who you should be mad at in the first place
@realDonaldTrump you sir are the one who is deranged!
@realDonaldTrump Anybody else with me on these sentiments? pic.twitter.com/QhWmJqcpI4
Nice to know that @realDonaldTrump is focused on Fake News and Fake Book themes still. Would have loved to have him here with us in Hawaii this AM! And feel the damn fear we felt... so that maybe he would take his flippant "button" comments to heart!
Truth has no meaning to @realDonaldTrump and his cult.
Come on @realDonaldTrump , stop messin' around with the national alert system. You're scaring people.
Reagan, Bush, Clinton, W., and Obama would have been on the tv hours ago reassuring the American people that all was okay. Instead, this shitgibbon @realDonaldTrump is at his golf course tweeting about a book that hurt his feelings and an election he never wanted to win.

@realDonaldTrump has repeatedly claimed he's "the least racist person." The record suggests otherwise. http:// bit.ly/2D8qRp3
I see why. @realDonaldTrump has shown how inept every other world leader is. In 1yr POTUS TRUMP has done more for the working middle-class families than Obama wanted to do in 8yrs.

During the campaign, @RealDonaldTrump lied to you (shocker) about the size of the U.S. trade deficit w/China. Said it was $500 billion. Even with it growing 10% during his first year as president, it's nowhere close to that /2
Wrong! Just like the poll that had Hitlery beating @realDonaldTrump . Another Snowflake Lib Fantasy Number. Keep it up @POTUS will keep #Winning #MAGA2018 #CBTS_stream #winning #maga #Qanon #8chan #LockThemAllUp #stablegenius #DeepState

When the @WhiteHouse edits the words the @realDonaldTrump spews, YOU, nor anyone there has any right to complain about something POSSIBLY being misquoted. (we won't even get into the outright lies)
As the labor participation rate stagnates while unemployment rate falls to 17 year lows... how should we interpret this? Let's ask @realDonaldTrump and candidate Trump.
The MSM want so desperately for the slur to be true that it will matter little that the only one making the claim is someone who is a proven liar during virtually the same circumstances. At least @realDonaldTrump now knows that he can't trust Democrats to be honest abt anything.
Your time Madame Speaker would be better spent in trying to help your constituents and by constituents I mean Dreamers who will lose all hope unless you and your cronies start negotiating in good faith with @realDonaldTrump ...

Well, thanks to @realDonaldTrump , Warren G. Harding will no longer be considered the worst president... Scraping the bottom of the barrel here, trying to come up with some upsides.
