I thought one of biggest lies @realDonaldTrump said he had more people attending the inauguration day then any other President. The Women's March on inauguration day had more protestors marching then all 30 people that supported idiot Trump!
Well, the libs are counting on your breaking with . @realDonaldTrump ...just remember, you are in the negotiating advantage right now. You have 1,000 days. Don't let the libs feel like you haven't won anything. We will get there, and get there fast.

@realDonaldTrump you talk about needing impartial journalists and needing fair treatment yet from the very beginning of your campaign facts and figures have been fudged left right and centre with some just outright lies. Now your inaugural year opinion poll is released with
@realDonaldTrump Guess what, you aren't the first.
If #NeverRomney was any good @realDonaldTrump would have hired him.
@BobLonsberry @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, it looks like NY's corrupted culture could affect the rest of the nation.

Well, I just read the @DavidAFrench article and it sounds very much as if Mr. French does, in the main, object to @realDonaldTrump because he is insufficiently intellectual or just not "nice".

@realDonaldTrump @VP @PressSec where is New Years present if removing the privilidge exemption of Obamacare to the 535 members of the swamp. Also prosecution of leaker Comey and other leakers in DOJ and White House MAGA drain the sludge and sewage
Time to pardon Kristian Saucier @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Indict Huma Abedin RETWEET & copy POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS - President Trump has spent a lot of time at his properties or golf clubs during his first year in office. - He has spent more than 33% of his days at a Trump property. - Additionally, he spent more than 25% of his days at his golf clubs.
I detest Obama comparisons but he had absolutely no management or leadership experience or aptitudes. @realDonaldTrump knows how to get things done. We all knew this pandemonium would ensue but despite total Dem obstructionism & media abuse, even you have to admit he's doing it!

2018 just began and Trump again has taken credit for something he had nothing to do with! FACT: There actually haven't been any deaths on a U.S. passenger airline since 2009. If anything, Trump has promised to loosen regulations on aviation. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #LiarInChief pic.twitter.com/xF9YdYNJyT

Yourr attention Mr. Trump ..... Nuclear crisis led by Kim Jung Un ..... is managed and directed by #LaHabana ... It is very important that you consult with your intelligence staff ..... Amen of Russia, China and Iran .... @realDonaldTrump ... #POTUS
Tweet @realDonaldTrump supposedly he is true king of the skies, reason there were no USA crashes this year. Never mind that there hasn't been a crashin forever.
...or what deadlines CNN considers most important. But at least this focuses on actual issues rather than criticizing @realDonaldTrump beverage choices.
Why is everything not in @realDonaldTrump favor #fakenews ? Why is everything great from @FoxNews and cheerleaders? Why does @realDonaldTrump degraded our entire intelligence community? Why did @realDonaldTrump disrespect @SenJohnMcCain , GoldStarFamilies, but love #Putin ? Why?
If we can fund trips for someone to play golf, @ffweekend @realDonaldTrump @CNN we should be able to over fund programs that take care of Children's Health

@realDonaldTrump No, you are the one who ended DACA, and are now trying to use it as a bargaining chip. It is you holding them hostage for your ridiculous wall. No one will forget when we go to the polls this year. #DACA #DreamActNow #ImpeachTrumpNow

Yo Paulie...ya crack me up! I never heard of you until your face was plastered all over the news. Guess ya got your 15 minutes of fame. Of course all 15 minutes of it would indicate that you're an asshole. Look on the bright side - you make @realDonaldTrump look pretty good.
If @realDonaldTrump was innocent he should just let the feds waste their time investigating to find nothing so he can then brag and talk about how they were wrong, but nooooo Dotard needs to keep bitching about how people are mean to him.

Can y'all send letters of invitation to all our citizens who said they would move there if @realDonaldTrump won? They seem to have forgotten. #StupidQuestionsForCanada
I find it absolutely reprehensible that @realDonaldTrump is calling into question the patriotism and dedication to this country of any career civil servant given the only thing he and his family give a shit about is padding their bank accounts with taxpayers money.
@realDonaldTrump is responsible for all the Navy accidents, though.
@realDonaldTrump you need to reinstate the State Department and Have expert's negotiate these issues for you. Not drop a few bombs here and there on Twitter. As you care nothing about the people you put in harms way who will die as a result as a result of your crude foreign pol.
Allowing corrupt people to get away with crimes is dangerous. Thank God for @realDonaldTrump . We the people are tired of Clinton and her cronies getting away with murder.
