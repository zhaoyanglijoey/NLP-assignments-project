I'm old enough to remember when @BarackObama invited Henry Gates jr over for beers to mend a rift. What a wasted opportunity for a wasteful and narcissistic president @realDonaldTrump
Thank you @SRuhle for calling out @realDonaldTrump lies!!
@realDonaldTrump is a dark stain on humanity.
@realDonaldTrump wants a country where he tells us what we can and can't do. Some1 please tell this orange, out for his own interests, idiot, that our military has been fighting 4 our freedoms 4 yearrsssss. 1 of those freedoms is 2 stand, or sit, or kneel when we want. #Eagles
@realDonaldTrump ALERT #FreeTommyRobinson Mr President, please stand up for this good guy and a patriot !!! Don't let those totalitarian elites in the United Kingdom to imprison people just like that, just like in Orwell's "1984", please raise the issue of his imprisonment
The @Eagles have earned my respect. While I always liked the team this just proves that they are the real deal. This vet will kneel with the players before she stands with the orange traitor in chief. @realDonaldTrump #makingpeoplestandisfacismnotpatriotism #VetsAgainstTrump
Can @kanye and @KimKardashian die of natural causes already? A few others too?! You know who. Millions of people die everyday. Somehow we get stuck with ass hats. Amirite @realdonaldtrump you bum muthafucka! Have another cheeseburger. You fat Fuck!

Many here in Philadelphia understand the symbolism & applaud your decision to not play the trumpian game. Thank you @jeff_lurie for supporting these men of principles. I am one of 100s of 1000s very proud to call the Philadelphia Eagles MY team. #FlyEaglesFly @realDonaldTrump
Kim Jong Un has recently been talking to Vladamir Putin and Bashar al-Assaud. Guess Kim's only friends are other despots. Birds of a feather. Mr. President @realDonaldTrump please be vigilant when you meet Kim Jong Un. Do not let him play you. (Trust no one)
Petty and vindictive. That's our @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump Get ready for your slide to Hell!

And worst time to drive a car - the gas prices in Chicago are over $3.60 for regular & over $4 for premium- all the price hikes are the fault of @realDonaldTrump #ThanksTrump
@realDonaldTrump So you uninvited the Eagles because you don't want to look pathetic stating up there with only a handful of players. They are right to not want to come to the White House with you in office. You're a disgrace. They have the right to protest.
lmao @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump You are a total PIECE OF SHIT. And I'm a PATS fan. Go FUCK yourself.

@realDonaldTrump you mad?? Stop trying to pin everyone against the military and vets! It's about people not wanting to be around you! This didn't happen with Bush, Reagan, etc. It's not about military or politics its about your disrespect toward people and I'm a military vet!!
@realDonaldTrump is THE definition of a snowflake!!
I want to say bravo to the @Eagles for saying no to visiting @realDonaldTrump at the white house!!!

I have a quick question for @realDonaldTrump . Why would you publicly state that you can pardon yourself if you're innocent?
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/w5pyztC9Su
Are you f'n kidding me?! @realDonaldTrump , you need to chill out!! That team has a right not to go to the White House if they don't want to, hell I wouldn't wanna go visit an overbearing super sized oompa loompa dictator wannabe either... let the hate tweets begin!!!! pic.twitter.com/wNjohCwLNb
Quite sure their feeling aren't hurt. More like a slap in the to #45! @realDonaldTrump
I am pretty sure they planned on going and @realDonaldTrump knew along he was going to cancel them. That way the team spent money and time on travel plans and then they get the rug pulled out by @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump ...Keep dealing!! pic.twitter.com/yMWbaqghvb
I agree completely with the #PhiladelphiaEagles not going to the White House to meet with @realDonaldTrump And hopefully, in about a week, the #GSW will be in the position to decide the same.
Clearly shows that Coward in Chief @realDonaldTrump lacks elegance, manners & chivalry. #MalignantNarcissist
What Black athlete would want to demean their-self? I am grateful to the @Eagles organization for supporting its supporters, (the Black community); its supporters, over, @realDonaldTrump racist policies. Philadelphia is a #ChocolateCity
@realDonaldTrump You rock! As the most powerful human on the planet, you set the days news cycle with each tweet. What will the worlds news coverage be tomorrow? We wait for your next tweet to find out. Loved the Rally in Washington Michigan!
4/?: ...with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow. They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country. ( @realDonaldTrump )
@realDonaldTrump snubbed by guest of honor (Eagles) - cancels party, like the whiny ass bitch he is

I hear if the @Eagles send @realDonaldTrump a well written letter, he may agree to meet up with them in Singapore.
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump knows the acceptance of a presidential pardon means accepting guilt of that which he's being accused
@RealDonaldTrump tomorrow is District 48 primary vote, give my friend @Shastina_Eloff a shout out, she will make a good addition to our Congress!
#PhiladelphiaEagles gaining more and more fans for the awesome way they stand up to #WorstPresidentEver @realDonaldTrump

I would bet the fund is invested in one of Dotard Trump's friend's funds where his friends make bank and pay a quarter percent per year in interest. This liar Dotard @realDonaldTrump really needs to go away for a long time.
Wow. @realDonaldTrump deleted the tweet about the special counsel being unconstitutional. Weird.

@realDonaldTrump is a fucking baby. Fly @Eagles fly! Congrats on being awesome and not giving in to a fascist. Fuck that guy. Seriously, he doesn't deserve one iota of respect.

@realDonaldTrump kind of a petty d-bag move there, el presidente.

3/?: He had fun with those who wanted to be there. Because Obama is a class act while Trump is a classless piece of shit who most people can't stand. This is part of Don The Con's statement: "The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House... ( @realDonaldTrump )
Too bad. While they were there the Eagles might have convinced @POTUS to pardon then for inflategate. BTW, what happened in the news today that @realDonaldTrump need to distract us from? Oh yeah, he lied about dictating statement on Russia meeting. No Donnie, we still noticed
@realDonaldTrump you're not the Eagles' president...why would you think you are? People here are applauding them...keep your racist party. #EAGLEPRIDE
Dear @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP DEFUND Planned Parenthood! this will force all the MEGA Rich Donors to donate to PP and LESS $$$$ to back LIBERAL Progressive candidate! How bout that??
Or the ultimate drama queen being @realDonaldTrump
Proud of @Eagles for not bowing down to wannabe dictator @realDonaldTrump !! No one wants to go to your racist shithouse!
@realDonaldTrump Heartbreaking. Such a shame you would cancel the Philadelphia Eagles invite to the White House. There are players, families, fans that are proud to say the NFL is an American sport. Very sad day for an American sports. Philadelphia Eagles deserve better. @Eagles
Hurray @POTUS @realDonaldTrump God Bless USA! Tooo bad @Eagles You won't be missed. #MAGA !!

No one should in doubt about the grand plan to distract the world from the unmatched records of performance of @realDonaldTrump administration by a section of the media whose bias is not hidden!
@realDonaldTrump Junior appears to not understand that it is in his best interest to maintain as low a profile as possible. But he is entertaining in his ignorance. Today, Junior learned what narrow means as to a court ruling, but not before tweeting (and gloating) about it.
@realDonaldTrump also, thank you for all you do. God bless America, God bless you
You seem to be able to rationalize anything with the bible in hand. I can't I use my bible to pray to God that he will deliver us from this evil @realDonaldTrump
