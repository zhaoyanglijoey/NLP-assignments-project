100% ...And less "executive time"...I work 12 hr shifts @realDonaldTrump should have to work at least 8 hrs a day!!!!
Actually @realDonaldTrump is being mocked all over the world!
@realDonaldTrump You have done so much to damage and destroy our country over the last year. I look forward to the day when I can spit and tap dance on your grave. You are a loser.
I agree with the assessment of @realDonaldTrump
STOP CALLING THE IMPOSTER, PRESIDENT. @realDonaldTrump is a Russion Illegitimate POSER and now that Mueller/FBI is reaching closer, DOTARD is punishing us all. COAL, STEAL, now IMPORTS! Trump threatens to tax European cars http:// cnnmon.ie/2oGHOyF via @CNNMoney
Clearly the @FCC is no longer since @realDonaldTrump since on the @IFC broadcast tonight when the #MFRS are flying #IndependentSpiritAwards
Jockdom reasoning @dukeCoach K(rzyzenski) is 71, @realDonaldTrump is 71. Which one would you rather have leading the country? I'm going with Coach K, and no he's not qualified to be POTUS. But seems to have integrity, interested in improving lives of young people, is a leader.
@realDonaldTrump is a master at what he is doing. I have no doubt he will be remembered in history books as one of the most effective Presidents we have ever elected. He is indeed draining the swamp without showing his hand. #TheArtOfTheDeal #MAGA #AmericaFirst #DrainTheSwamp
Fuck you @realDonaldTrump .
Are you in the city holding up traffic? @realDonaldTrump #scammer
Yes, DONALD, Putin meddling is REAL. . @realDonaldTrump needs to GROW UP enough to accept facts! We've been saying . @POTUS naive & vulnerable for manipulation by PUTIN & supporting his program! 1-Hateful divide, 2-Undermine institutions, 3-No sanctions, 4-Free to mess w elections.
@realDonaldTrump Get These Ppl out we Helped & Now!Sense of entitlement disgusting!Demanding?How many living off Workers Tax$?
@MissLynneO @realDonaldTrump @RepMattGaetz he's the absentee AG. We want ACTION!
. @realdonaldtrump is in a constant state of #campaigning . Doesn't know how to do anything else. He spends more time planning #2020election than working for the #American people. Then he plays #golf for 30 percent of the year, weekends at #MarALago at #TaxPayers expense. #MAGAFail

@realDonaldTrump They didn't do likewise for Hillary. The Black Panthers stayed home in 2016. Why is the witchhunt still going knowing what the Black Panthers did.
@realDonaldTrump you should promote this for a Pay per view! Think of the ratings! It would be Yuge!
If you screw with the 2nd amendment, you will be out on your ass in one term. @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump As President, you are supposed to govern, not create chaos, confusion, distrust, fear and division...not to gamble with global catastrophe and hope for the best while risking annihilation. LEAD. PLEASE LEAD. DO THE RIGHT THING.
@realDonaldTrump I'm a liberal Democrat who supports the Second Amendment. I have a CCW and support gun control. I'm in Liberal politics and pro 2A politics. I'm in a unique position to help both sides understand each other. I'd like to work with your staff on gun laws.
@realDonaldTrump hey have you heard that Americans want stricter gun control laws????

@realDonaldTrump IF you wanna know about real collusion in presidential elections try this on: in 2008 and 2012, the Black Panthers were out with their guns in hand at the polls saying "If you ain't gonna vote for Obama go home."
Sums up my week with the chaotic news of WH and Republican antics. @realDonaldTrump this is how Americans feel about your sorry #NRAWhore ass!! #Truefact pic.twitter.com/IX1sHNvBgv
Where is the PUBLIC support for @realDonaldTrump ? On anything? I'm talking to @GOPChairwoman -Ronna McDaniel, @SOTHPaulRyan -Paul Ryan, @SenateMajLdr - Mitch Turtle McConnell? Ronna has been public lately, the other two?
May the luck of the Irish be with @realDonaldTrump ! P.S. Please reconsider your plan to place #Tarrifs on steel and aluminum.
Well Trump did just lose his CLOSEST advisor - yeah sure, not be be a douche, but does anybody really think @realDonaldTrump was relying on a 29 year old former model for advice on running the country? Please
I've never read a statement so stupid and devoid of fact before. I'm sure even @realDonaldTrump would have tweeted something that would have had at least some tenuous string of truth to it. The day Ireland has a problem with "African Gangs" is the day I run outside naked #Lidl

You mean, @realDonaldTrump ?
But you guys love @realDonaldTrump . You should be happy to pay more.
Insider trading is a crime. Ask Martha Stewart @realDonaldTrump
Is @realDonaldTrump delusional or just a moron? Or both?
They screwed up not talking him into running in '16, he probably could've won. Def would've been better than Hillary...but that scandal w/ his son. Their loss, our gain: we got @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump before trump starts a war with n.korea take a look at the stocks his friends are buying!
Fox News seems to be able to handle the chaos just fine. Sent the tarrifs message out in the AM, @realDonaldTrump blurts out the plan before days end.
A #leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way! @realDonaldTrump
Here's what it's all about: @realDonaldTrump is broke and in billions of dollars of debt to the Russians. EVERYTHING he does is in service of keeping his dirty little secret hidden because it proves he and his "brand" are a complete and utter fraud.
So @realDonaldTrump is a total coward, owned by #NRABloodMoney

@realDonaldTrump is trying to go after everyone that's not going after us . I still wanna know when will he do his job and invoke the sanctions against Russia. There the only ones holding a nuke over our head.
