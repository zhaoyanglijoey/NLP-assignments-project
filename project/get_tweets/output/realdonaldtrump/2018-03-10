We had an election.Trump won.I wish he hadn't.I wanted @CarlyFiorina or @RandPaul to become President.I even preferred @DrJillStein to @realDonaldTrump ;But,for the sake of America,I wish some of President Trump's opponents would accept the past;And move on!
@realDonaldTrump If the Republican want to keep winning start SUPPORTING UNIONS.Common man depend on the Unions, if a person does not want to be long to the Union..ok, but don't expect any benefits from the Unions negotiations.
Has @realDonaldTrump been to the West Coast, specifically California since his inauguration?

I remember about 4 years, or more, how Rand Paul was against the Government being able to see all our Data & would end up in severe Abuse! Turns out he was Right! @RandPaul @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @foxandfriends

@realDonaldTrump Depending on your risk aversion, U might consider bringing Israel in as a trading partner, which would be a slick move, if U can pull it off! It would force them all 2 deal w/one another 4 trade & that would be the 1st step 4 a more lasting & acceptable PEACE!

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS We've become so brainwashed by decades of government lies and propaganda that we'll give our children dangerous drugs instead of the safe cannabis alternative. Why are we so afraid of a beneficial plant? End the prohibition. #MAGA #USSVI pic.twitter.com/lCJa3LcXrL
