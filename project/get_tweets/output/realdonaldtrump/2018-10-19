Now that you know that Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered do you @realDonaldTrump have another feeble explanation for his demise that your admirers will salute?
Until I'm proven otherwise the ONLY reason I can see for supporting lying draft dodging corrupt morally bankrupt racist @RealDonaldTrump is because he brings out the white pride in you or your IQ is struggling to reach double digits. #MAGA #RacistParty
President Trump, I'm sure, has fabulous ideas for getting California back to what it once was - and as a Republican - as I've told all Republicans - you should stand with him and beside him so that he can guide this country back to greatness @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @HouseGOP
@realDonaldTrump This is what you do on constant basis to the American people: 1) Lie 2) Mock 3) Insult 4) Invoke fear 5) Sabotage Health Care 6) #Sinkhole the national debt.

Oh shut up #CryingChuck Dealing with the Saudi's let @realDonaldTrump know about your involvement with Al-Waleed bin Talal. You know he sang like a bird....tic-toc #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Congrats on YET ANOTHER week of WINNING! Ur ABSOLUTELY CORRECT 2 send the Military to SECURE the BORDER -This GLOBALIST-GENERATED CRISIS will prove ONE of the BIGGEST TESTS of ur PRESIDENCY=Where MISERABLE ANGELA MERKEL FAILED her people, U, @potus ,WILL TRIUMPH!
@realDonaldTrump you tiny f'n despot. Historically, demonizing ones enemies, "dem's are evil", "dem's want ms-13", makes it easier to get the publics support for extreme measures. This is America bitch and we aren't going to tolerate it.
Imagine the laughs @realDonaldTrump 's friends will have when he pretends he's Khashoggi with his fingers and parts of his arms cut off!
So they admit it, now where is the body? Taking a month to figure it out? Not buying it and neither should @realDonaldTrump just because this guy gives u a lot of $ does not give him the right to do whatever he wants

@realDonaldTrump ANOTHER PROMISED KEPT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT LIE.Thank you for not throwing the eater in the ocean like Obama did. He made us suffer on purpose. He is the NWO that's why. They were in the end part of devastating us. And along comes TrumpHe touches (Gold)
again, like Moscow Mueller's direct & indirect "indictments"... what does this have to do with @realDonaldTrump ? because Fake News Media will inevitably, invariably blame Trump somehow...
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Good Afternoon! Good luck & prayers for a fun, safe, & successful #TrumpMAGARally Thanks to the "Great" women & men of Arizona for supporting you, @RepAndyBiggsAZ @RepMcSally @GOP candidates, and for helping to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #VoteGOPin2018

Donnie the Mob Boss whines about Democratic Mobs as he praises violence. That's rich, and not the money kind. "Intellectual" Eric stands for what ever his dad @realDonaldTrump tells him to or else it's a big ol' kiss on the cheek, Fredo.

Good! It's time for @realDonaldTrump to order the Navy to send PT cruisers to patrol the Mexico/America border from the West Coast to Gulf Coast like a traffic jam in LA. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Build the Wall or We The People will one load of rock at a time! @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
@realDonaldTrump and @SecPompeo must wait for investigation to complete. The murder of Jamal #Khashoggi is too easy a case. Who benefits from a broken US-Saudi relations? -Terroristic relatives imprisoned by Prince #MBS -Wahabis, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, other theocrats against reforms
Yaaaaahooo!!! I just knew it could happen!!! I've been tweeting my fingers off to @realDonaldTrump !!!! I'm so very glad for yall!!! Ill be watching on you tube!!!! Just remember that 1 thing!!! Y'all deserve to be there singing our nation's Anthem!!! pic.twitter.com/AVcsxtBu47
Is there a F--king RULE OF LAW or NOT? Why are these CORRUPT CRIMINALS still laughing in the faces of the US Citizens? @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Anybody ever heard of military tribunals around this place?
Everyone already knows that @realDonaldTrump thinks Russians like Q are "Great People". Just look at how he worships Putin! #WWG1WGA #RussianBot pic.twitter.com/53ELI2rymI
Agreed. @realDonaldTrump looks really WEAK while he whines about money, like some high paid working BIOTCH
I don't watch @HardballChris but it would take a tar roller to slam all that body fat @realDonaldTrump
THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump !!! WINNING !!!
Fist Fight? I doubt it! @PressSec @AmbJohnBolton @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

@IMKristenBell what a dork you are..u cant kiss someone because they are sleeping??? NERD ALERT!!! @Disney @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Please give a shout out to Right-side Broadcast network who are streaming all the maga rallies live. Showing all the crowd indoors and out. They need a little recognition to keep coverage going. We love to watch the rallies Rhanks
ALL for what reason? Everyone knows to help destroy #AmericaFirst @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Five bucks says @realDonaldTrump is so stupid he'll not only believe but parrot the Saudi explanation for the murder. If he was intelligent and a real leader, he'd question it, but he's going to prove me right that he is an idiot with no ability.
I just told my wife I was only 1/1024th working this weekend. She said like hell I was. Hmmm... What's my next move? @elizabethforma @cnn @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump A little help here, please.
Send @realDonaldTrump & family to live in Saudi Arabia now. Trump is a CANCER to our ppl and the base and rest of you better WAKE UP before it is too late and your insurance is gone, your social security and medicare. He is FLEECING the USA. Don't believe a word he says.
@realDonaldTrump So, Rod Rosenstein gets to testify in a closed, classified setting before 2 Dimms and 2 retiring GOP. No oath. No transcript. Free to continue to lie his Poindexter ass off. This is the ringleader of the coup folks. The treasonous SOB responsible. What???
@SecPompeo has been all over the place lately same as @realDonaldTrump . Hardest working administration in my lifetime. #MAGA
Gestures? Gestures? But @realDonaldTrump didn't call for his supporters or his party to specifically go bodyslam journalists or Democrats?! Did he? Why are you crying?! Democrats however have made specific call to action to terrorize Republicans and it's been acted upon. IDIOT!
. @realdonaldtrump is a weak leader who is afraid of everyone except immigrants. He thinks that he might be able to win a fight against some who is hungry and tired. Trump fights the weak because that's what rich asshole bullies do. #BeBest #MelaniaHypocrite #TrumpIsAnAsshole
@HillaryClinton or @nikkihaley for president in 2024? Hands down Nikki would be a very representative of women voters! Amazing potential! @foxnewspolitics @DiamondandSilk @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump
@JamilesLartey @Bencjacobs You are not God on Earth but as anyone else risking his lives while working. If you breaks the balls with your idiot questions don't pretend to go thru the thunderstorm safely, lightning may hit you. @GregForMontana go @realDonaldTrump @SteveKBannon
@realDonaldTrump & Jared Kushner insist that they are. Will you try to pin that on Democrats somehow?

@realDonaldTrump Caravan migrants, defying Trump warnings, smash through border fence en route to Mexican territory https:// fxn.ws/2q2NT8L #FoxNews KEEP THESE UNINVITED ANIMALS OUT! This can ONLY BE CALLED AN INVASION & BE DEALT WITH BY THE MILITARY!!
Trump only acts macho with women but cowards and praises dictators like himself! @realDonaldTrump
What will they do when they get here? Politely wait until processed? No. They will break through ILLEGALLY and bring more diseases that were eradicated here last century with them. @realDonaldTrump please send our military to stop them. Don't let them break thru as in Mexico
More jokes about @realDonaldTrump and all the other Republicans pls!!
We're digressing but.. Yes. I support President @realDonaldTrump & I like him as a president. Much more than former president Obama but not as much as former president JFK. Not 100% who I'd like to see in WH but it's a changing America & I'm rolling with the punches as best I can
@realDonaldTrump is a coward and is in on the whole thing.
@realDonaldTrump & @IngrahamAngle @TomiLahren @LouDobbs @parscale @foxandfriends @BreitbartNews did this to America.
Stable Genius @realDonaldTrump Wins again! Gets cooperation with Mexico to stop the #Caravan in its tracks. Thank you Mr. President for protecting us against yet another Illegal Invasion! #VoteRed #Trump2020 #WalkAwayFromDemocrats2018
This is exactly what @realDonaldTrump violent rhetoric has caused, Trump needs to be held accountable by everyone in the @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP @tedlieu @OversightDems @NicolleDWallace @MaddowBlog @KatyTurNBC

@realDonaldTrump , stop trying to make #JobsNotMobs happen. It's never going to happen.
Um, @realDonaldTrump , what reality do you live in? Violence is violence, it's NOT "a different league & different world". How many journalists have to endure violence &/or death threats? How many have to die before your Extremists wake up & see you for what you really are?

He deserves to be treated no differently than any other American who commits treason! #MilitaryTribunal - even #JusticeKavanaugh and @LindseyGrahamSC described that recently at the SCOTUS hearing! cc @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @replouiegohmert pic.twitter.com/5xluq5uBbb

Hope she does run and wins so we can all do to her what she had done to @realDonaldTrump all this time. Ohh, Hilly, payback is a female dog!
. @realDonaldTrump Based on my research, when Donnie dies, 66% of Americans will say, so? Who gives a shit? The rest will still be stupid. #americaisnomore
And Patriots not globalist @realDonaldTrump
Well, it does confirm one thing, they are definitely taking advice from #WhiteHouseSquatter @realDonaldTrump ...
So when @realDonaldTrump tries to sweep this under the rug, what will you do? Whatever he says or will you take your spine out of the closet and use it?
@Nigel_Farage lets gets the #UK sorted buddy.... @realDonaldTrump has the #USA covered
What Americans need to understand is that all Russian interference in your election is not specifically directed against the US but to support @realdonaldtrump & his destabilizing policy against NATO to attack the European Community The target is not the USA but the EU #MAGA ?
