@realDonaldTrump You have lacked an #Auriga for far too long. Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris. #notsoonenough
@realDonaldTrump doesn't speak for MOST of us! Kavanaugh* doesn't deserve an apology, EVER!!! And, HE should be apologizing to his family for what HE put them through!!! #vote #MeToo #VoteBlue #Kavanaugh
This is why I will never vote Dem @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/IGb4KPYRWu
Trump knows how it feels, accused of rape/sexual assault 16 times, including one 13-year-old, Trump identifies with KKK Kavanaugh. @realDonaldTrump really did say this to Howard Stern, Trump called Howard during the 2016 campaign begging him to take the interview from his website pic.twitter.com/e8nfQ4F4Ei
Because America is trash! Why you would send someone off to fight and possibly die for your nonsense and not look after them once they did the work. Any decent mobster looks after its people in prison and when they get back out. @realDonaldTrump where are ya Mr U!S!A!

When is @realDonaldTrump going to apologize to @BarackObama and the family of @SenJohnMcCain
Wow, you've got a thing for rape. @BillClinton had issues with sexual behavior just like @BretKavarnaugh , @realDonaldTrump , etc, the difference is while the rest of the world is trying to make up for how we handled sexual assault, the @GOP is embracing it as their platform.
@realDonaldTrump is POTUS. He speaks for the country whether or not you like it or agree. #Kavenaugh is on the bench. #getoverit
@realDonaldTrump hey, take a look at yourself!
of course @realDonaldTrump would aplogize to the assaulter vs the assaultee
Thank you President Trump. Congratulations Justice Kavanaugh!! God Bless you and your family. @realDonaldTrump @BrettKavanaugh #GODBLESSAMERICA #VoteRedToSaveAmerica pic.twitter.com/wkFMD9JhQg
@realDonaldTrump ur one big eye roll. Sad!

@realDonaldTrump Orange Jerkoff says Trump was "proven innocent." That isn't even a thing...and this was not a trial. If it was a trial, there were only two outcomes possible: Guilty or Not Guilty. "Innocent" is not part of the legal process.
And THIS is why I can't stand the "tolerant" scum bag Democrats. Lmao. This response was all because I said it's her word vs his. Lol @dbongino @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/cZeHyCPfPL

Just checkin' in on my favorite high cheek-boned Indian! What's going on in Pocahontas' neck of the woods? @realDonaldTrump
#Kavanaugh Congratulations to Mr Brett Kavanaugh There is NO EVIDENCE to support the lurid claims made against him It is RIGHT that the presumption of innocence, a cornerstone of our Western democracies, has won the day @realDonaldTrump is RIGHT to apologise for pain caused
Words fail me. All I think of when watching this video is that @realDonaldTrump would find a way to mock these brave people and that angers me to no end.

Apparently, @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr and basically the whole GOP thinks they can convince others that half of American citizens are a "mob", because we don't agree with their attacks on civil rights. So tonight, I am going to post a few things just from the FIRST year.
YOU do NOT apologize in my name to Kavanaugh. You had a chance to clear his name of sexual assault charges but chose NOT to interview the victims. AFRAID to find out the truth of course. HOW DARE you call it a HOAX!! You, sir, are a vile liar. @realDonaldTrump
People actually believe @realDonaldTrump gives money to #Vets ??? All he does is belittle #POWs , #Active and #MilitaryRetirees ! Lol, omg, @GOP is gullible! #BiasConfirmationNews
Dems received a very well deserved slap upside the head for bastardizing the Judicial Nomination process from @realDonaldTrump . Kavanaugh was pure class. #HimToo
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @taylorswift13 UNPATRIOTIC UNAMERICAN TREASONOUS TRAITOR, it is called the 1st Amendment Taylor Swift is an American citizen she has the right to her opinion and she has the right freedom to post whatever she wants about the Senate race. #VoteBlue
@realDonaldTrump You speak only for Deplorables & you should only speak for Deplorables. #BrettKavanaugh is a sexual predator. He's an even worse disgrace than #ClarenceThomas .
He is a neocon and enemy of @realDonaldTrump . He has been trying to undermine him since day one.
@realDonaldTrump -- Kavanaugh wasn't proven innocent -- he got away with it -- now you sexual assaulters can compare notes on how to mistreat women ...
@realDonaldTrump you dont speak for me.
The one issue with this notion is that @realDonaldTrump can only survive if he brings everyone down a few notches to his level and/or divides and conquers. The man has zero consensus building skills and lacks an understanding of the larger global community.
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @SenMajLdr @BrettKavanaugh How date U 3 call American people protesting in civil manner, which Every American Citizen has a right 2 do, a mob. The real mob has been the Repubs who have decided 2 shove a alleged attempted rapist down the throat
Don Jr Braun in Indiana needs your help. His debate with Donnelly was average at best please come to Indiana and carry Braun over the line!! . @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump How bigly of u to want to apologize to BK for all the exposure he received.Have u apologized to all the incarcerated children whom u separated from their parents.Are u at least working on it? We cannot go on with a traitorous prez and a tainted SC. #Impeach

@joanwalsh Is there anything that @realDonaldTrump can do to have you say something nice about him or what he does? I'm sure you noticed that Associate Justice Kavanuagh had his family and friends with him the entire way. Dr. Fraud was by herself, no family or friends by her side

In fact, all you have to do is remove California and . @realDonaldTrump won by over 1 million votes.
Hey @realDonaldTrump do not apologize for me. You do not speak for me.
The entire GOP Congress now has assumed psycho attributions in that they are PROJECTING everything they are doing on to the democrats--following der leader @realDonaldTrump WHOSE SERIOUS ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER results in his constant combo of grievance/projection rants.
The angry mob was seen in Charlottesville carrying torches and is responsible for the death of one innocent woman. The very same people who @realDonaldTrump said are very fine people.
@realDonaldTrump DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR me nor for the millions of other Americans who know Kavanaugh has no BUSINESS being on the supreme court!

@realDonaldTrump wonderful speech tonight.
@realDonaldTrump Don't apologize to Brett Kavanaugh on my behalf, cuz i ain't saying it!!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe he is not going to fire him bc our President knows he, Rod, is going down for the political coup that is going on now and we know he is a big part of it. Firing him is not as dramatic as him being brought out in handcuffs.
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump With cousins like yours, who needs enemies? Next time look in the basement for documents forgotten and un-shredded!
Yeah.... and what is even more scary is she is a teacher....this is what's indoctrinating your kids in government schools with taxpayers dollars. Think about that. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you have no right to apologize to Kavanaugh on the nations behalf ... I do not apologize at all for what he & his family have gone through
@realDonaldTrump DO NOT apologize to Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation, you only speak for your kind! Not the rest of us!!

@nikkihaley @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse and the rumors start and propaganda will spin out of control @PressSec
In a tweet, "this is war, time to fight". And in the video in the original tweet, @realDonaldTrump says it's time to defeat the democrats for good. He and his supporters are getting the Republicans ready for war against Americans
Obviously @realDonaldTrump was curious also because he just led a cheer calling out each state, and the Nebraska cheer was FAR louder than Iowa's.
Since the 'win' of the confirmation, "Republicans fight back now. @realDonaldTrump has changed the Republican Party significantly for the better. Democrats should be terrified" this was @XStrategiesDC tweet from earlier today. Also @DonaldJTrumpJr said
I love listening to President @realDonaldTrump There's always something new and brilliantly funny each rally. And some good things the same... #BuildTheWall #USA #LockHerUp "Her" is now encouraging violence. We should change too... #HangHerUp ( #HangHerUpUntilSHEDead )

@realDonaldTrump is outrageous, Ivanka is qualified to sell clothing and shoes not represent America at the UN.
Set aside the electoral malfeasance (foreign and domestic): What rapprochement could be reached with #Cult45 whose judgement found @realDonaldTrump fit to become #POTUS ?
The biggest applause of the night -- by far at @realDonaldTrump rally -- is when the president mentions "Nebraska." The dangers of any Council Bluffs rally. "I just want to see who the hell I'm speaking to!" Trump said.

THEY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH @realDonaldTrump ! He's running circles around every.fucking.body.
This is the actions of a scared @GOP that when Trump @realDonaldTrump attacks the press something will happen to you.
So, the #OED actually has a picture of @IvankaTrump in her official #WH capacity in its definition of #Nepotism . Only @realDonaldTrump has the chutzpah (which is Yiddish for "disconnected to reality") to act like it would be a purely personal attack on him to call this nepotism.
You, #BrettKavanaugh , were NOT PRIVEN innocent and for @realDonaldTrump to utter those words is an outright lie...although, what else should we expect from #trump and this administration? Certainly not ethical behavior.
They showed a pattern of behavior. Supposed journalist willingness to let nothing stand in the way of attacking @realDonaldTrump and everything he does.

@realDonaldTrump is a small, petty man. Some day soon more of his supporters will figure that out. maybe will be when they find out how much he's taken from them; maybe when they realize he chose a rally over a hurricane of epic power in FL; maybe it will be the $500M he stole.

I really think we may be missing the point. They are reporting on the president, @realDonaldTrump and where HE has chosen to spend his time and attention . They are shining a light on his failure to lead, how it's all about HIM and his desperate need to be liked.
Hey @realDonaldTrump , when are you going to do The @joerogan podcast?

@Swerdlick Something to perhaps consider when discussing the relative significance of job growth numbers is that the closer a national economy inches towards full employment, the harder won growth is. Also, I bet the burgeoning gig economy helps @realDonaldTrump 's numbers.

Typically this is where someone would call you out for posting bullshit -but you already know that. The comment was not about Fox broadcasting this crap - it was about @realDonaldTrump holding rally's as a sitting President. Try and keep up.

@realDonaldTrump Why don't you mention that the Fed is not fed, but a private bank????????????????????
Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump Will only say "I asked the Prince and he said he didn't do it." Just as he said about Putin.
@realDonaldTrump OAN showed the crowds several times during your Rally this evening. OAN stands by you more than Fox Murdoch Brother's do. Moreover, your tweets haven't been shown on Fox for the past week!

Fuck the bridge, @realDonaldTrump is selling America. Litterally!!!
. @realdonaldtrump has long complained at rallies that media cameras don't show the crowds. But he may well know that when any president is talking on stage, TV cameramen never move the lens off the president. A separate TV camera can shoot crowds.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr Is the Deep state cutting you off from your people? Why no rally coverage? @FoxNews
The problem is no one wants to meet @realDonaldTrump so he takes anything he can get.

@realDonaldTrump @PressSec There is a network that shows all the crowd at the president's rallies. Right Side Broadcasting is doing a great job and routinely shows the entire crowd. They are small and could use a shout out from the Pres.
Yes it would. If he's the one who planned this with @realDonaldTrump and is Q, he knows everything and he's the only person that Dems/Libs, who are asleep, would believe, on-the-spot! Him being alive, makes a huge difference

There should not be a reason for Republicans to worry if Democrats win in November they would impeach @realDonaldTrump . The Democrats are also Americans and deep in their conscience they realized the great achievements of this president and would not do any move against him..

@realDonaldTrump I dont watch 60 min and never will again over 200 promises kept and she is just......Unreal 70% of gov. 30% not confirmed #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Mr.President, that little maggot Leslie Stahl was only interested in tripping you up, and trying to make you look bad. She wanted to know top secret information for Christ's sake. A venomous little snake she is. She showed no respect to you!!!
So children are the ones who suffer? @realDonaldTrump #Immigration
@realDonaldTrump watching you get interviewed on 60 mins is hilarious. You are so stupid lmao.
I can't believe such a seasoned newswoman as Lesley Stahl is giving such a terrible accounting of herself, in the interview with @realDonaldTrump . The questions are too cute by half, biased in tone and insulting.. to her.
@60Minutes back to #RussiaRussiaRussia & implying the #muellerinvestigation is real @@realDonaldTrump presidency is in jeopardy. What a bunch of assbags! Sadly, their idiot audience/sheep will believe it. The media IS the greatest threat to our counrty! #DrainTheMedia
@realDonaldTrump you say your poll numbers are very good!! 54% disapprove
@realDonaldTrump so calm and collected on 60 minutes, even with the unfair reporting !
@CBSNews @60Minutes @realDonaldTrump Leslie Stahl is a disgrace and part of the "fake news." She treated the president with so much disrepect with her left wing leading questions. Totally lost all respect for 60 Minutes. FIRE LESLIE STAHL!
The only laughing stock of the world is you Donnie boy @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes

@realDonaldTrump Time to shut Tyndall air Base down and move planes based there to a safer location It is really really stupid to have 400 million dollar aircraft left under a hurricane ..no matter the excuses Use Tyndall as a staging point but move the planes permanently!
CBS NEWS - 60 Minutes- biggest regret for @realDonaldTrump was not getting out of NAFTA faster
@realDonaldTrump American hospitality industry needs to catch up with wages since everything else has.people will continue to eat out but restaurant owners are the ones reaping the benefits while keeping wages stagnated to be in compliance with minimum wage laws
Bill Clinton was more worried about blow job than doing America justice!! Bill Clinton is a sexual predator. President @realDonaldTrump is Amazing & True!! @60Minutes or should I call you Bill Clinton 69 minutes. Obama let kids at the border go with sexual predators

@60Minutes editorializing while not allowing the @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to rebutt. Cowardly and creepy. Obama Cages? Really? You people are disgusting!

This interview just secured the mid terms for @realDonaldTrump ! Thank you 60 minuets
@realDonaldTrump you are an inspiration to young adults here in OHIO! Thank you!
SO COMBATIVE' IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH BOMB @realDonaldTrump
Leslie Stahl pressing & persistent in her questioning of @realDonaldTrump but sadly tries so hard to trap him or corner him that she misses an opportunity to appreciate his value. He is the right man at the right time in history. Should be taking notes. Literally. #GodBlessDJT
@realDonaldTrump ple ple ple trump help me amount.quickly
@realDonaldTrump can't even mention any regrets of his past 2 years.
@OANN @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @DailyCaller Thank you for showing every MAGA rally since Day 1!
@realDonaldTrump Good job keeping interest rates down, very important! Also if people wonder about rising seas, they should read the Bible, it was already predicted over two thousand years ago!

@realDonaldTrump watching your interview with 60 Minutes tonight sir. You did very good. Especially since every question they were trying to get you 2 admit you felt you had done something wrong. You held your own. God bless you and your family God bless America. Hang in there
I believe I have made a masterpiece @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @wbir pic.twitter.com/uQzIhc1zHY
This #60Minutes with @realDonaldTrump is just absolutely devoid of anything that could be remotely considered intelligible. He's just a hideous human being.
@60Minutes @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson ..GEE THAT WAS LIBERAL LESLIE DOING THE INTERVIEW?THOUGHT IT WAS ANDERSON IN DRAG!
"So when I won the election. . ." says @realDonaldTrump on "60 Minutes" Only a guy who knows he lost would have to keep talking this much about how he "won." #60Minutes #TrumpRussia
@60Minutes Lesley Stahl's questioning is ridiculous. @realDonaldTrump is running circles around her
Is it me, or is Leslie Stahl of #60minutes just rude to @realDonaldTrump ? Talk about having an agenda.
@60Minutes , @realDonaldTrump ; LESLIE STAHL was profoundly NEGLIGENT in preparing for the KIND OF QUESTIONS she commanded Trump answer.I DEMAND CBS+Stahl read Toffler "Power Shift"1990; REVIEW anti-compet TRADE restrictions "PURITY+SOURCE ORIG" LAWS&Anti GMO. Toffler battle Intel
Watching the 60 Minutes interview with @realDonaldTrump and I'm am disgusted with Lesley Stahl and CBS. Totally biased and disrespectful.
@LesleyRStahl @CBS I am extremely disappointed to see that you create your spin of the conversation after the camera is off of the President to fit your negative narrative on 60 minutes. Fake News is real and you are adding to it! Shameful and disgusting!! @realDonaldTrump
Have you ever seen a sitting US President treated so disrespectfully during an interview on @60Minutes , or any other program? @realDonaldTrump shouldn't give them the ratings bump. @LesleyRStahl is a hack. #60Minutes
