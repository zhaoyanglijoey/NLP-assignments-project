Huge crowd outside @realDonaldTrump rally in Houston. Think Antifa wants to start shit in Texas tonight? Antifa scumbags don't know squat about strength in numbers. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Donald dont take and wait too long, send the military apaches and tanks for shock and awe. this is an invasion and act of war I feel. we trust you. but we have your back and are there if you need us. The Americans voting red. we will not let the Dems win.
Watching our Great President @realDonaldTrump in Houston! What an enthusiastic crowd. Hey Betco @RepBetoORourke you can't come close to this! Adios!
Now if you are watching the Texas rally and see Ted Cruz and now Our President Trump enter the stage you will have chill bumps and goosebumps and pride in the United States of America! I love USA. I love our president. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump is our hero watching the #houstonRally
Ted Cruz surprised me. He was willing to let the past be the past and move forward to support @realDonaldTrump . He thought of what he could do to benefit his state and the American people rather than letting words from the past affect Americas future. Smart.
Did you see that they almost kissed #BeautifulTed and @realDonaldTrump
I have such happy tears as I watch the people of Texas all smiles as they welcome our GREAT President @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump ask you top general at fort Leonardwood to end the drug war the morning are the ones who traffic that stuff and then put people in feamia camps jail stop you go to he'll for that shit

@realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch @seanhannity @DiamondandSilk @LouDobbs @rushlimbaugh Ironic massive migration of immigrants is timed for midterms. Another effort by Dems to make GOP/POTUS appear inhumane. SELF-SERVING maneuver by traitorous DNC.

@realDonaldTrump where's Rudy?
I guarantee this is a ploy to try to get as many votes before the November elections, but it will never happen ! @realDonaldTrump lies & deceits the American people in order to keep his corrupt administration intact !
Substance vs. platitudes,you got neither with @HillaryClinton ,platitudes with Hope & Change @BarackObama but NO SUBSTANCE. In President @realDonaldTrump we have a STRONGER economy, public confidence & military.Historic low unemployment #for everyone,that IS substance. #MAGA2018
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, please give a shout out to Omar Navarro working hard to beat Maxine Waters in CD 43 in California.

Does @realDonaldTrump wear only red ties these days?
@realDonaldTrump wow the transformation of POTUS according to http:// Politico.com POTUS no longer calls Cruz "lying Ted" he calls him Beautiful Ted or Texas Ted. What an absolute joke. Stumping for the most hated man in Congress. #Resist #VoteBlue #BlueWave
@TheDemocrats are saying what about this invasion? UNLESS THEY STAND BY @realDonaldTrump to protect America, they should be treated as ANY TRAITOR was in era 1776! That is exactly what they are, NOT defending this country! @seanhannity @marklevinshow @GOP @WayneDupreeShow
YAY !!!!! #Texas !!!! @tedcruz and @realDonaldTrump Area packed !!!!!!
Can someone tell me why El Chapo is in jail? Sure he's a criminal, but he had policies that took care of his people grandly just like @realDonaldTrump Why don't we just over look his immoral behavior and let him go back to taking care of his people. @FoxNews @amjoyshow @AriMelber
@realDonaldTrump We are running at a time! We can't wait until they get to our border! If these people get through you've lost me.
It's showtime. @realDonaldTrump is in the building and #Texas is showing her appreciation. #TexasTrumpRally WOW! It doen't get any bigger than TEXAS!

@realDonaldTrump Hey exciting news! Did you see all the people at President Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders' rallies today? And they didn't have to pay them like you do. It was beautiful. I bet you wish you could do that! You can't because you are a LOSER and HATED by many!
Never thought I would see @tedcruz go FULL IN for @realDonaldTrump . I love this! #KeepTexasRed #HoustonRally

The Boss is on @realDonaldTrump yes!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Absolutely no doubt this is a highly orchestrated invasion! We need to get our troops there NOW!! They need to see we are serious about them turning around and going home!
Dude.. you don't stand a chance in Texas. Texas votes for Americans, not Chumps that want to destroy what @realDonaldTrump has created and will continue to do.. right through to 2024.
In 2020, @realDonaldTrump will be overwhelming elected the PRESIDENT of The United States ~ via @tedcruz #MAGA #HoustonRally #GodBlessTexas
@realDonaldTrump Question. Are we seeing enemy combatants among this stream of immigrants who are going to try to enter our country? If not, we definitely may see criminals breaking our sovereignty, laws, and how about international law? Just wondering.
Sounds like @realDonaldTrump is making it up as he goes, again.
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/ldZO8XmDdl
because of all this, I won't vote for Traitor Trump or the Republicans; I am a Democrat who hopes to vote for you or any Democrat who has a mind not to fall into Putin's trap, but Traitor Trump's @POTUS @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump trap, as well. Orange Hitler/Spanky is in w/Putin!
Does the @NFL know there is a @realDonaldTrump rally in Houston tonight? Lol, they should have rescheduled.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS stop lying to the public just so disgusting. Hope you watched the Florida governor debating. Your candidate dodged the question are you a good role model? A pussygaper, psychological lair, corruption a thug as well as gold digger from ur dad sad!!!

@realDonaldTrump Send them all!
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/QKlqNmdYdh
People react to these two emotional extremes- FEAR and GREED. The president @realDonaldTrump is trying to stoke both as we are now 2 weeks from the midterms. Ignore it. Stay focused on the truth and VOTE.
it's NOT rioting it's celebrating that @Dodgers are going to #WorldSeries - The only sport @realDonaldTrump plays is pocket pool... pic.twitter.com/3gzX07WjBq
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, this is an invasion. Migrants being used and lied to get to American soil and live a free lifestyle. Drop essential supplies miles behind them. Send back to Mexico! Cut off aid that only enriches greedy foreign governments.
#TedCruz just gave @realDonaldTrump a 2020 endorsement.

President @realDonaldTrump is at the podium
@realDonaldTrump interesting who your supporters are. Same intellectual level as you- definitely minimal capacity
There should be an investigation into Elizabeth Warren's @elizabethforma claims of native american status to see just how much money through the years she took away from REAL NATIVE AMERICANS!!! @realDonaldTrump , @FoxNews

Why would someone vote for you? @realDonaldTrump harassed you "lying Ted" N worse is the conspiracy he brought up about ur father. Wow, how the "party of Christian values" 4get "Honour thy father and thy mother." #weaktedcruz Bow 2 ur puppet master who believes he's above ur Lord
I just saw someone put "Air Strike" when they saw this picture. I am really losing faith in humanity under @realDonaldTrump .
In debate, really shitty FL GOP Gov candidate was asked if @realDonaldTrump was a good role model for children - so naturally, he answered by blathering about the US Embassy in Israel.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President. I know you don't have time to read all your tweets. But, I know this much. This so called "Caravan" is nothing more the an "Invasion" and it's test of your resolve and I back you 100% on what ever you do. pic.twitter.com/XnkGiDX9iM

No, @EricTrump is driving us to the polls ! However, it's very telling about how adolescent he & his ODB p***y grabbin dad @realDonaldTrump & Rethuglicans are about being provacateurs versus actually leading America & all her people towards "One nation under God"!
