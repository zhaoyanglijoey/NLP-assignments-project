@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump I wish the press would take the advice of Be Best! How much more could be accomplished if everyone would support our President & U and pray for God to direct his path. All they want to do is cause division and strife. They should read Proverbs 3-5&6.

@realDonaldTrump Yes ! to your stand on Iran deal! Now on to KJU. Try a bit of image bolstering to increase your chances of success. To the extent that he saves face (important) you are more likely to strike good deal. Call him a wise leader for his people! Courageous!
Why does @realDonaldTrump keep making moves that increase the potential for nuclear war? Simple: He knows that being POTUS means there's always a plan to keep him safe. The rest of us don't matter. #MAGA
We're not being held to nuclear blackmail. @realDonaldTrump is holding America hostage to with his lack of knowledge and impulsive act's in the attempt of erasing progress made by the Obama presidency. Qualifies as an act of a jealous despot.

@realDonaldTrump GO AFTER JOHN KERRY FOR TREASON! NO MERCY FOR TRAITORS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU.
@realDonaldTrump the only time ive tweeted you is to tell you thanks for ruining our nations credibility into any future arms deals. this world will be different in 5 years, at least for the U.S. What were thinking exactly?
Patriotic, responsible Americans citizens also express regret and concern over every irresponsible decision made by @realDonaldTrump .
Thanks @realDonaldTrump you done good #Simorgh
. @EmmanuelMacron @AngelaMerkeICDU @ClarenceHouse , Dear World, We in the #USA are sorry about @realDonaldTrump pulling out of #IranNuclearDeal . Remember #Trump wasn't elected it was a #VoterPurgeCoup . Most Americans want him out of Office. Staving off #Fascism best we can. #Resist
The SPecial Counsel Robert Mueller Probe is politically motivated. Former @FBIWFO Director Jim Comey testified before Congress he manipulated the system to get a Special Counsel investigation going against @realDonaldTrump #DepAGRodRosenstein is a part of the soft coup, too pic.twitter.com/9kdxDBhVVY

@realDonaldTrump Thank God a MAN is in the oval, and Pajama Boy is crying behind the scenes. Go back to the Choom Gang BO, and let the adults fix your mess! Take Valerie J with you. #RestoreOurRepublic
Glad to hear @JozyAltidore is on the road to recovery and will return in 4-6 weeks to play soccer in Canada again. Those same bone spurs kept @realDonaldTrump from playing in Vietnam indefinitely. #voteAltidore #TFCLive
You need to get your nose out of it. You did enough to destroy AMERICA by worrying too much how other countries and illegals can have the upper hand. I will take @realDonaldTrump s way anyday. Look out for America FIRST, not as your after thought
The Mullahs are also child sex traffickers and human traffickers! Have you not seen how many pedophiles, child & human traffickers have been taken down in the US in just Trumps 1st year as @POTUS You hate @realDonaldTrump bc you are told to hate him & don't see the truth.
There was time to address the core problems @realDonaldTrump discussed, but those core problems were not addressed. There is no room for their complaints.
I fear the Left has something on him? I hope not, but I just don't understand his mindset since @realDonaldTrump was elected.

@realDonaldTrump Keep up support for Gina Haspel. If she did anything on the edge, she was acting on legal opinions from the Justice dept..
I exist for news days like this. @realDonaldTrump is having a hell of a crappy day.
@CNN @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity @dbongino @SebGorka Who cares if a Russian gave Cohen money it didn't get paid to Trump has nothing to do with Trump many 100 thousand attended the inauguration he was not personally invited by Trump
America now we know Vladimir Putin owns @realDonaldTrump and this administration. The question is how much did it cost @realDonaldTrump to sell our country democracy to Vladimir Putin? Any ideas on the dollar amount. @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan guys impeachment is the next step.
Flushing Our Country down the toilet 1 day at a time. Feels like a slow death @realDonaldTrump
It's amazing how quickly (and rightly so) the #CorporateMedia was to call #Blankenship #racist for saying #ChinaPerson , yet when @realDonaldTrump said Mexicans were rapists and murders, they fell over themselves with #Apologetics ... #WVPrimary
What a sell out you were. Half white privilege resulting in an Audacity of foolishness so glad @realDonaldTrump is erasing you and your legacy of soft hand diplomacy. Bowing buffoonery an apologist for American Power. Good day, sir and please fade away into the dustbin. 44 who?

Cleaning up decades of corrupt - and just plain stupid - policies that were taking U.S. the wrong way? Way to go @realDonaldTrump !
@RealDonaldTrump dsn't hv a clue whats in the #IranDeal & or care.He's pulling out bc @BarackObama is attached to it.He is an EVIL SCORGE on mankind & too dumb to even know why. @TheDemocrats must pledge to reinstate it the second they back in power. @DNC @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
And @realdonaldtrump still has two more years to make America great again #maga

How much is @realDonaldTrump paying Rudy to get him out of the White House.
Apparently there may be more to the story! Using the phrase #Remember Roy Moore? " Does @realDonaldTrump know something about Blankenship the rest of us don't know?
Does @realDonaldTrump know that there is a volcano erupting in Hawaii? No potable water in Flint? But today, he gets buzzed up on drugs and starts an arms race in the middle east? Who voted for this idiot!
@realDonaldTrump Don't back down from holding AG Sessions accountable!!! Don't be a pawn in their corrupt game!!! Stick to your guns and instincts, you know it's the right thing to do, don't cave to political pressure!!! We the people need you Sir!!!!
Instead, start some talks w @EmmanuelMacron & @KremlinRussia_E is my suggestion @JZarif @HassanRouhani @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense
Obama claimed the Iran deal was negotiated from "strength". No it wasn't. It was negotiated with cash, lot's of it. We gave them billions, and they said, "ok, we'll take the money, no sanctions, and audit our own nukes." Thank you @realDonaldTrump for getting tough and #MAGA !
Reminder: @realDonaldTrump is a bad president.
Just so @realDonaldTrump can screw you on that too. So yeah, congrats @FLOTUS

Hi @realDonaldTrump . You may not know this, but @iamjohnoliver and @LastWeekTonight did the math for you and they discovered that 0 years is LESS than 10 years. So now that you've prematurely pulled out, Iran could pursue nuclear weapons in 0 years. https:// youtu.be/5xnZ_CeTqyM
@realDonaldTrump the evidence mounts and Mr. Cohen will not do 10-20 years for you in state prisons.
@realDonaldTrump Learn, before you speak? How about you learn to speak, before you speak.

History will tell the story of the worse president ever and how he tried and failed to erase the legacy of one of the best presidents ever. @realDonaldTrump will top the list of most notorious US Presidents. https:// politi.co/2IlQaXD

FYI only. I find there are 3140 or 3141 counties in America. Depends on who you ask. Maybe they count counties in territories, who knows. 3141 - 487 = 2654 that Trump won. yoohoo Love my President @realDonaldTrump .

In the private sector there are rarely any COLA raises given. Raises are tied to performance and rarely exceed the cost of living for most. @realDonaldTrump should know this. He exploits cheap H1B visa labor daily at Maralago.

@realDonaldTrump needs to be reminded as well, as he cast the die for egregiously bad and insensitive behavior. She was only following in her maker's footsteps, hoping for a thrown crumb of acknowledgment. It did not work.
If this kind of bullish comment was made by a Dem or anyone @POTUS doesn't like and it was directed to him or anyone he favors he'd be calling for them to be fired. So @realDonaldTrump how will you respond?

Why is it crazy? After years of failed policies by @BarackObama you cant stand the thought of @realDonaldTrump getting things done and inspiring change around the globe? Get used to this. The world has become a safer place under a true leader.
Agree! @realDonaldTrump should have the utmost loyalty. The bickering & jealousy need to stop at the door when arriving to work. Gov't employees need to learn the value of team work. Isolation has no place in the workforce as it causes hostility to grow. Expose the leakers.
