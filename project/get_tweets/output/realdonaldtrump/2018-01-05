In further news, Donald Trump @realDonaldTrump sues the makers of IT, saying that he should be the scariest clown in America.
So that proves that @realDonaldTrump is the most transparent president ever
So, when are you going to tell us that @realDonaldTrump wants to ban them from immigrating and placed on the "No fly" list?
@realDonaldTrump #NationalBirdDay pic.twitter.com/eTjwg054P5
and best of all is that @realDonaldTrump is such a weak and ineffectual president that anyone and everyone can write or say anything they want. Due to his lack of backbone and strength in any capacity its open season on the buffoon. Brilliant
@realDonaldTrump Enjoying reading FIRE AND FURY this afternoon...still can't believe there were enough idiots to put you in office. #WorstPresidentEver #IdiotInChief #25thAmendmentNow
If @POTUS @realDonaldTrump backpedals on No Amnesty it will be the end of this country as we know it. Round em' up and Ship em' out!
It's quite doubtful that Little Donnie @realDonaldTrump can wrap his tiny cheeseburger soaked mind around that concept. And most assuredly he doesn't care enough, nor is he capable enough, to learn anything new.
Without mental stability how can he @realDonaldTrump built that fortune & have networth about $3.5 billion, how stupid are you @CNN @MSNBC @billmaher @jimmykimmel #FakeNews
@realDonaldTrump thinks he owns the world and that the world owes him for their existence
Please explain to him that should @realDonaldTrump cave on DACA, that he will lose most of his base. This is NOT putting #AmericaFirst as he promised us!
@realDonaldTrump You want to push for infrastructure repair, so why don't you push Congress to get rid of Davis Bacon?

Dr. Justin Frank said on @MSNBC that Mueller remind @realDonaldTrump of his father. Muller is going to throw Trump out of the WH like Trump dad threw him out of the house and sent to military school. Lol

@realDonaldTrump Please hold another rally ASAP. Hopefully in Jerry Brown's back yard CA.
The counter puncher blame the other guys when your in trouble Trump Clinton Obama whoever is in government has issues to deal with but @realDonaldTrump has to be the worst idea of a president now diversion lying no responsibility bully a real politician now funny that
Rather surprising that after 12 months of @realDonaldTrump tenure in Office, you suddenly realize that Sr Officials at the FBI and Justice Dept were deceiving and conniving the American People. You, Senators, owe @realDonaldTrump and the American people an explanation and apology
@SteeleAndUngar so @FoxNews is the station my dad listens to but now @realDonaldTrump is like my virtual dad?!! TX caller.

@TheTwoMikes @realDonaldTrump is a very dangerous man and his book came out Midnight last night and they were a queue around the block and sold out. Also there is no button to hit on a desk its a link of numbers there is no such thing as a button on any desk.

@Twitter is letting @realDonaldTrump tweet us into World War 3 with frankly asinine stance that world leaders have special dispensation. A fucking gas station cashier is held to higher standards of conduct. Twitter is complicit in formenting violence against millions.
