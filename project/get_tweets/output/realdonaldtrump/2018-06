It's #PrideMonth , and can I just say how unsurprising it it is that @realDonaldTrump hasn't mentioned it? He's talked about loads of other things, but I guess that us LGBTQ+ people aren't important enough to him. Whatever. I don't want his approval.
American kids are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as kids in Germany and more than five times as likely to live in poverty as kids in Denmark. We have a childhood poverty crisis in our country and @realDonaldTrump is doing nothing to stop it.

More important-what kind of husband DOESNT go to hospital WHILE his wife is having surgery-start to finish?! @realDonaldTrump said he spoke w/her morning of surgery&went to see her in the afternoon.He's pathetic. @BarackObama would be been front&center if it was @MichelleObama
Here's hoping that @FLOTUS may just be in Witness Protection in exchange for turning on @realDonaldTrump . #WheresFLOTUS

Oh fuck me. The one satisfaction I was going to take from the @Patriots losing the Super Bowl was that the @Eagles would have to spend an afternoon with @realDonaldTrump .
Losers gonna lose; winners go'in to win so much that we may get bored with winning. #MAGA #KEG @potus @realDonaldTrump
Took vacation time. Paid for Amtrak plus parking. And now the $ Eagles pull this? So disappointed. Couldn't they be respectful of our Commander in Chief and their fans?! @realDonaldTrump @ChrisStigall @CNN @ESPNNFL @MSNBC
@realDonaldTrump is a fucking baby. Fly @Eagles fly! Congrats on being awesome and not giving in to a fascist. Fuck that guy. Seriously, he doesn't deserve one iota of respect.
@realDonaldTrump I would love to be at the White House tomorrow for our beautiful National Anthem.

The @Eagles aren't invited because they disagree with @realDonaldTrump aka President Bone Spurs
Can @realDonaldTrump pardon himself?
@realDonaldTrump are Jim Acosta was throwing a fit today forgot his ID card or some s***
@realDonaldTrump is a petulant child. If you disagree with him on anything, he shuts down. ( #RudyGiuliani thinks the Petulant @POTUS can actually kill a person who disagrees with him & Trump could get away with it by pardoning himself.) pic.twitter.com/EwBOQ6tyD6
@realDonaldTrump kind of a petty d-bag move there, el presidente.
EVERY Championship team present and future should refuse to go to the @WhiteHouse as long as that Russian owned #Chickenhawk #CadetBoneSpurs #IllegitimatePresident @realDonaldTrump is there. Trump is the #BiggestLoser , not worthy of respect. Only contempt.
@realDonaldTrump COWARD!
Great Call by @realDonaldTrump ! I would have done the same thing. SCREW THEM!

@realDonaldTrump so you cancelled the Philadelphia Eagles celebration. Such a whiny little girl you are.
Happy #PrideMonth @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump illegals with children should get priority / expedited deportations to avoid separating them..it's for the children
Just so you know I love all you guys on the #TrumpTrain and supporters of #MAGA and #KAG and @realDonaldTrump
The framers never envisioned Putin asset @realDonaldTrump .
3/?: He had fun with those who wanted to be there. Because Obama is a class act while Trump is a classless piece of shit who most people can't stand. This is part of Don The Con's statement: "The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House... ( @realDonaldTrump )
Too bad. While they were there the Eagles might have convinced @POTUS to pardon then for inflategate. BTW, what happened in the news today that @realDonaldTrump need to distract us from? Oh yeah, he lied about dictating statement on Russia meeting. No Donnie, we still noticed
@realDonaldTrump you're not the Eagles' president...why would you think you are? People here are applauding them...keep your racist party. #EAGLEPRIDE
Dear @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP DEFUND Planned Parenthood! this will force all the MEGA Rich Donors to donate to PP and LESS $$$$ to back LIBERAL Progressive candidate! How bout that??
Or the ultimate drama queen being @realDonaldTrump
Proud of @Eagles for not bowing down to wannabe dictator @realDonaldTrump !! No one wants to go to your racist shithouse!
@realDonaldTrump Heartbreaking. Such a shame you would cancel the Philadelphia Eagles invite to the White House. There are players, families, fans that are proud to say the NFL is an American sport. Very sad day for an American sports. Philadelphia Eagles deserve better. @Eagles
Hurray @POTUS @realDonaldTrump God Bless USA! Tooo bad @Eagles You won't be missed. #MAGA !!

No one should in doubt about the grand plan to distract the world from the unmatched records of performance of @realDonaldTrump administration by a section of the media whose bias is not hidden!
@realDonaldTrump Junior appears to not understand that it is in his best interest to maintain as low a profile as possible. But he is entertaining in his ignorance. Today, Junior learned what narrow means as to a court ruling, but not before tweeting (and gloating) about it.
@realDonaldTrump also, thank you for all you do. God bless America, God bless you
You seem to be able to rationalize anything with the bible in hand. I can't I use my bible to pray to God that he will deliver us from this evil @realDonaldTrump

Yes, but most of us know what Nina Turner did the summer and fall of 2016. Her vitriolic rhetoric against @HillaryClinton helped @realDonaldTrump .
We all want to know what is wrong with @realDonaldTrump ! Respect for the Eagles for standing together. Unity is not understood by the President!
wow. @realDonaldTrump @nflcommish @NFLPA . I didn't often agree with Obama, but he is a Leader. Now we have a president that has gone out of his way - like a mean-spirited child - to disrespect @NFL players - not even attempting to truly understand WHY they are protesting.
Get rid of @realDonaldTrump and the rest and this problem will end...
@realDonaldTrump #FlyEaglesFly Propaganda and the truth are polar opposites. One is built on nothingness, the other on solid rock. One is inaccurate. The other is inalienable. You are a sad individual. God bless what soul you have. @Eagles fan since 1988
@realDonaldTrump 's kiss of death. He spread his loser curse all morning. Hahahah
However, my mother also supports @realDonaldTrump , so I don't really know what will happen here.
So if this were true, @realDonaldTrump WHERE are the President Obama children containment camps?
If @realDonaldTrump pardons Manafort it will add to his obstruction of justice and abuse of power. We have to make the Republicans fear us more than fear their base. Let's figure out how to do that. Me importantly we have to vote them out. We need more offense.

First of all, there is nothing good about @realDonaldTrump . If you think for a second he cares anything about you or anybody besides himself, maybe you need to take some courses in the psychiatric field instead of just the medical field. You can't see the forest for the trees.

One good thing about @realDonaldTrump on twitter is, the world can see he is a narcissistic sociopath & an unstable moron. He publicly broadcasts it in his multiple tweets. He clearly has no conscience, nor feels embarrassment & continues to embarrass himself & America.

As a Cavaliers fan, I still say bravo to Steve Kerr who has a greater understanding of patriotism and leadership than @realDonaldTrump .
He did. He "uninvited" only, because the whole team didn't accept the "invite"...only 10 were said (by manager/coach) to be attending. With @realDonaldTrump being all about the #numbers , you know he couldn't take that. He had to save face and make it seem like he dissed them.

So, if @realDonaldTrump seriously thinks it was us Canadians who burned down the White House in 1812, I think he needs to go back and take a History lesson. Canada was not even a country until 1867. Some may have been future Canadians, but thats about it.
Here's the thing @realDonaldTrump . You exhibit all the classic signs of an abuser, and I'm not going to be bullied into not caring if your wife disappears again. You're fucking crazy and I don't trust you. You hear?
@realDonaldTrump Barron probably could've told you that. Damn.
Perhaps North Korea will cancel the summit again. With such an insult, I would tell @realDonaldTrump to go f**k himself.

Umm, you do realize that @JenGranholm was (a great) governor 8 YEARS ago, right? It's a bit late to bringing her into this. Oh, wait, you're just playing by the @realDonaldTrump handbook. You can't defend your actions so need a strong woman who took on a tough job to criticize.
@realDonaldTrump You should resign cause you seriously suck at this
@hardball : @realDonaldTrump is not closer his adversaries than his allies. He is closer to America's adversaries than to America's allies, which means, America's enemies are Trump allies. If you think about it, we have an America's enemy in the oval office. 1/2

It is so cool having @realDonaldTrump as our president. I'm so proud. Sjws tried to play him and send the mascot. Trump says no thanks the doors are locked. Lol don't disrespect the office
Redistribution of wealth. They do it nationally, and internationally. Then they redirect our attention, with a complicit media, to anything but the real agenda of most of our government. I really hope that @realDonaldTrump is the bringer of the end of the deception.

@realDonaldTrump is right: There should be 0 tariffs by any country. @SenJohnMcCain doesn't like Trump fighting who have been imposing tariffs and/or banning certain USA products for decades. Allies should be treating the USA as an ally. They and McCain are hypocrites.
@JustinTrudeau Build that wall Justin. Keep the wanker @realDonaldTrump out
After consulting with @AxlRamonesDaddy I think the only way to fix the relationship between the US and Canada is to have @BretHart wrestle @realDonaldTrump #trump #wwe #wrestlingdiplomacy

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President why are you allowing Rosenstein and the DOJ to hold justice hostage?
@realdonaldtrump why do you always just go on twitter and attack people and not call them to tell them yourself? I dare you to call up Robert DeNiro or invite him to our house and tell him EXACTLY what you just tweeted. I dare you, Donald. Do it. See what happens!

The only part of the #ObamaLegacy that @realDonaldTrump CAN"T erase. I know it stings, I remember a similar feeling when O was elected but the BEST part is that #teaparty predicted the bHo's agenda, and now there is PROOF!
@realDonaldTrump is totally wrong on this. CNN and the rest of the MSM are not even close to being "The Press" - just anti Trump propaganda,
@SecPompeo is learning the @realDonaldTrump way fast: Lie all the time, bash the media, and never answer a question honestly. Sad!
Ah, poor little treasonous snowflakes in the @WhiteHouse . If you don't want to pay the price for treason, @realDonaldTrump , don't commit treason. Cohen is going to flip on you. Bigly.

@realDonaldTrump should resign and be tried for treason. He's a hypocrite and if he's attacking @clairecmc , the Republicans are scared of her! Ha ha!

@POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump FYI Agreements even in the U.S. let alone with other countries must have every little detail spelled out. Only a an idiot would trust the other party to follow "implied" agreements let alone an enemy! Where is that smart smart brain?
Never has a leader of a free country behaved as undignified as @realDonaldTrump . I personally find overly insincere fondling cringey. On an international level groveling is deplorable.
Happy to trade tit for tat with them.. Notice she does not mention President @realDonaldTrump stated we can all drop all of our tariffs and subsides but nobody was interested in that.
Before @realDonaldTrump we skyrocketed in race division, male/female division, speech intolerance, history intolerance, AntiFa violence, kids killing kids, political censorship, child trafficking, Marxism and attacks on citizenship, culture & religion. We're done w/ Progressives.

Happy Birthday @realDonaldTrump You are the best! Thank you for your service bettering the lives of the American people and the lives of people in all nations! Enjoy your day. Prayers for you, your family, and your team every day!
@realDonaldTrump You're going to have to now call a spade a spade, and ACT on it on everything, immigration and justice department on the top. You have the Am. people behind you. You will win. Sandra
We hope you all will be at the ICE internment camp in Aurora with us sending a clear message to @ICEgov @TheJusticeDept @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump that what they are doing to our immigrant brothers and sisters and our immigrant children is despicable
Happy Birthday!!!! @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Do you ever think back to your bogus bone spurs claim to stay out of Vietnam, and feel ashamed down to your core? #Liar doesn't deserve birthday cake.
This is the problem with America. There are no Americans anymore there are only @TheDemocrats and @GOP . @BillClinton had @MonicaLewinsky @realDonaldTrump has @StormyDaniels . Sex scandals include @RepJoeBarton (R) @RepJohnConyers (D). We survived @NixonLibrary Watergate. Worse now
Happy Birthday Mr President @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I would think with the picking of Pompeo you now after 1 1/2 have a pretty good idea who should be on your cabinet. It rid of some of these back stabbers who care nothing about your agenda. Keep press secretary Sanders....she is awesome!

@realDonaldTrump My guess is you are celebrating your birthday. Hope you are enjoying yourself.
@realDonaldTrump Happy Birthday! Have a blessed day.
You've lost plenty of battles, @realDonaldTrump (including battles of "reading," "listening to others smarter than you - AKA 'Everyone'," "knowing what the hell you're doing," and "being a human being"). So, needless to say, a LONG way from that whole "winning the war" thing.
Thank you Mr. President @realDonaldTrump for firing @Comey . Just another example of you putting America First as you work to #MAGA .
People defending the Christianity of @PressSec , @realDonaldTrump , or @jeffsessions , please show me one fruit of the Spirit they have. Just one. On the other hand, they have gone against everything the Bible says about refugees, children, orphans, widows, and the fatherless.
G-6 hit back hit back @realDonaldTrump all his business , Vancouver make sure you hear crickets at Trump Tower , buy nothing own the the Trump family. It going to cost you big time!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Can we get the original version of the IG report? You know... the un-redacted and un-revised by Rosenstein version?
@realDonaldTrump Listen Up. Take The LIVE Cameras OUT Of The WH Press Briefings. Take Away Their Hate Platform!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Have a happy dude

That IG report is complete too. Looks like that independent investigation into @realDonaldTrump and #Collusion is doing what it's supposed to be doing. At this point #TheDogCatcher could be president rofl
Try to use professional courtesy. If your outburst were truly sincere then you would have used decorum. No one including @realDonaldTrump wants to see children in this predicament yet obviously neither you nor the Dems have any substance to share besides super sentimentalism.
Hey speaking of fucking retards, @realDonaldTrump happy birthday, cunt. Thanks for continuously finding ways to entertain the hell out of me while simultaneously continuing to ruin my generation's foreseeable future. Luv ya hon.

My uncle was KIA in the Korean conflict. Silver Star recipient, my father (who was younger than him) turns 89 June 25. No, his parents are not still alive. @realDonaldTrump what other inane statement do you have?
#Nazi @GOP and @realDonaldTrump want to separate children from their parents at the border. What would they say if we took their children and grandchildren away from them? No #empathy or #commondecency among these monsters
. @realDonaldTrump , you've probably noticed by now that committing America to a Less War future is the most popular thing you've done in office. If you really want to hurt CNN and 'Fake News' (negative) media, never give them another international war to profit off. Starve them.
@realDonaldTrump already has so many "Sleeper" reasons...been planting the seeds of doubt and dropping hints and ideas of conspiracy theories ...won't be hard for him to come up with another story...or sideshow.
@realDonaldTrump ....are you having a Shirley Temple White Russian to celebrate you birthday ?
@realDonaldTrump If it's illegal to help illegals come to our border, where are the arrests of these lawyers, non profits and churches that do this?

Sessions the deep-state RINO working against POTUS Trump. @realDonaldTrump

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump I'm with you on not signing the bill proposed by that snake @SpeakerRyan I think he's doing everything he can to undermine the will of the people and the laws that applies to illegals in this country.
@realDonaldTrump You probably should start reading bills. Do you really think the children of migrant workers should be granted amnesty?
We must never forget the damage @SenMajLdr has done to our country. The stolen Supreme Court seat, the refusal to support Obama on Russia, and now the enabling of @realDonaldTrump . Complete disgrace.

In six weeks 2,000 children have been separated from their parents. 2 members of @realDonaldTrump 's administration, Jeff Sessions, and @PressSec said it's okay because of a Bible verse. Retweet if you're a Christian who is sick of the bible being weaponized for politics.

@realDonaldTrump I voted for you, but I cannot get behind this. Taking children, especially young children, away from their parents is simply wrong. I pray for you to have mercy and compassion and put an end to this. There has to be another way!!
How much were they paid to betray your family honor by consorting with a vile, unprincipled, pantywaist who would not even defend his own family against insults from @realDonaldTrump and actually endorsed him for president ? #spinelessworm

If you talk to @PressSec or @realDonaldTrump call the lies out to their face! If you are reporting on what they say tell all the lies. Call a lie a lie, it is not alternative facts or a falsehood it is a lie!
This is ridiculous. Internment camps in #America under @realDonaldTrump 's leadership. @mike_pence @IvankaTrump @PressSec @FLOTUS
@realDonaldTrump Oi. The democrats didn't pass the movement to cage separated children from their parents. Your mate Sessions did. Repeal now. Disgrace.
Bunch of whimps Finally someone with stones @realDonaldTrump N Korea this and that, do nothing for 60 years
Don't forget Sessions told us quite awhile ago he had "nearly" 500 attorneys working w/ Horowitz along the way!! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Let the kids go back to their families. What you're doing is monstrous and evil.
@Potus can stop this. He started it. If @realDonaldTrump wanted it to end, it'd be over. When he decided it will affect his reelection bid, THAT'S when he'll #DoSomething #FamiliesBelongTogether

You are fos. This is the brainchild of racist Stephen Miller, the protege of none other but @jeffsessions . @realDonaldTrump implemented it to secure his border wall from the @Democrats . Now onto your next lying tweet.
Thanks. Really odd that the moronic @TalismanJohnnyA thinks I'm doing "far left rants" when I'm a middle-of-the-roader. He must be so far to the right he's a neo-Nazi.... But then. @realDonaldTrump has been dog-whistling racists and Nazis the whole time.... pic.twitter.com/DITVI9Rmfm

Hey whoa @realDonaldTrump got people to be mad about brown kids being separated from their families. I'm happy but let's try to remember there are nearly 5,000 families with holes where their loved ones who died in Hurricane Maria used to be, too.
2/2 Or why don't you run for office and "put your money where your mouth is" if you think you have the answers. Especially now with @realDonaldTrump according to them, he hasn't done anything right since election day. Just pisses me off ya know!!!
You are clearly a decent man a patriot honest with integrity. Country before self. Honourable. All the qualities @realDonaldTrump does not have
What is it with the poorly educated & @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews #TrumpConcentrationCamps
This will be @realDonaldTrump downfall. The lies and evil behavior are too damning here.

@realDonaldTrump What kind of Happy Father's Day is this when you are enforcing heartless and cruel acts against innocent children. All over the world people are watching in horror.
@realDonaldTrump We don't negotiate with terrorists and you're a terrorist! #FamiliesBelongTogether
The only kids that need to be separated from their parents are Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka. Barron and Tiffany are cool though. @realDonaldTrump #Happyfathersday2018 #immigration #FamiliesBelongTogether
Shame on you @realDonaldTrump for outright lying to your people and snatching babies and holding them hostage. #EnoughIsEnough why do Americans keep you . SHAME on you and your supporters.
. @ICEGov harassing Northern State citizens, some kind of ruse to make Americans think they aren't just harassing brown people. @RealDonaldTrump Administration thinks Americans are stupid ...and there's probably a good reason for that.

@realDonaldTrump Does anyone know the answer to this question? Can the President, as top law enforcement official, pick a Special Prosecutor, outside of the DOJ & FBI, to independently investigate the FBI & DOJ & make criminal referrals for prosecution to a Grand Jury? pic.twitter.com/N26wG8f3ph
@realDonaldTrump never ever said Nazis were good people. There were good people living in Germany when the Nazis took power however.
I finally figured out how @realDonaldTrump has gotten confused about non-existent "witch hunts" supposedly after him. He's been mixing up what the Special Counsel is doing properly with @NRA concerns about witches casting spells on *them*! At last, problem resolved.

Remember when liberals and #fakenews media barraged @realDonaldTrump with calumny on #familyseparations , using photos of children in cages? It turned out those photos were taken in 2014 when @BarackObama was prez and they deleted their posts, didn't lambast #Obama .

Remember, @realDonaldTrump could reunite those kids with their parents anytime he wants. But he chooses to leave kids terrorized & locked in cages. Trump hates kids but really hates foreign kids. His soul is malignant. His insides have been eaten away by hate
@SenateDems should filibuster ANYTHING immigration related until the child separation policy of @realDonaldTrump is reversed! Do not reward this! Give a mouse some cheese... #FBR #ChildrensConcentrationCamps
@realDonaldTrump is unfit for office possibly. Those individuals that voted for him getting him elected, and those individuals that continue to support his presidency, seem to think he is fit enough to be their president. This psychologist seems to think being a jerk is uncommon.

Question about space force: How much of the money will be spent fixing infrastructure of Puerto Rico? How much on returning children to their asylum seeking parents? How much on health care for poor, elderly, those with pre-existed conditions? Should I go on? @realDonaldTrump
Yes he can if he builds a Dyson sphere.... to encompass the sun and all inner planets. It will keep illegal aliens the greens and the grays out . Trumps kind wont want them in our country...probably cost 100 trillion or so there goes the budget! @realDonaldTrump
So does separating children from their parents in exchange for wall money qualify? #TrumpsKidnappingChildren @SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump @PressSec pic.twitter.com/wPNlyUD68i

Hey @realDonaldTrump We already have the National Aeronautics and SPACE Administration you ignorant dolt. Try funding it instead of creating more bureaucracy and big government. I thought you were against that, hypocrite.
@realdonaldtrump if we have a space force, will you tell us which species we are legitimately defending earth from and are you complicity saying for sure there is extraterrestrial life on or near earth as it stands today? What is the current threat level from those forces?
@realDonaldTrump and his equally fascist "senior adviser" Gestapo chief Stephen Miller blame child kidnapping on Dems b/c Dems won't give him border wall. In that case, I blame my boss not giving me a raise for my Web surfing, news reading and tweeting at least 4 hours out of 8.
Our Congressional delegation seems to rather hear children terrorized than get a nasty tweet from @realDonaldTrump .
Also @realDonaldTrump you realize creating a space force is illegal? Look into the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. @KellyannePolls you need to advise this #IdiotInChief before he speaks. #FUCKTRUMP #MoronInChief #Dotard

. @realDonaldTrump did along with John Kelly and Steven Miller. Since he listens mainly to himself, @POTUS is the Administration.
Bless you and thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your honest humanitarian response to the evil, cruel policy of tearing children from their parents by @realDonaldTrump @POTUS . Your voice is needed to teach the "Reality TV President" that this is not the way Americans treat families.

These numbers are historic. @realDonaldTrump has stated publicly that he will stop when he receives funding for his wall. You don't have a leg to stand on in this fight. The fact that your defending this says alot.
Yeah, it was just the top asshole @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I wonder if Mexico and south America would like it if America went down there and overtake everything they have with the help of half their government

When the left are complaining that @realDonaldTrump is going after the spy in his campaign it only makes @TheDemocrats look increasingly stupid. They deliberately just admitted to spying on the president and his supporters!
@realDonaldTrump deflects news about all this with SPACE FORCE announcement, he needs to make up his mind, a wall to keep illegal aliens from coming over or a space force to protect us from aliens invading us ~ its one or the other. Where is getting the funding for this ?

No, it started in April when @usagsessions @realdonaldtrump @SecNielsen john kelly & little stevie miller decided there were too POC & not enough whites & this was a way to stop the flow. Torture the kids. & it's thousands. & it looks & feels like kidnapping, caging, interning.

@realDonaldTrump The trump folks who say we should "follow the law" and separate children from parents--were they all "follow the law" when Congress passed Obamacare?

You should all be charged with crimes against humanity. Trumps policy of separating children from parents at border was his idea, his implementation, his policy. @realDonaldTrump lies, distorts, and is the destruction of America, the land I love. #impeach
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for correcting course and pledging to keep immigrant families together. The more you lead with compassion, the more opportunities there will be to do great things.

That's what he thinks. @realDonaldTrump thinks we've made noise up to now, just wait until word about this gets out.
God bless you for any influence you wielded upon @realDonaldTrump to bring to pass the EO signing today. Please follow up with him to ensure families already separated can be reunited.
So, @realDonaldTrump 's #tariffs are going to save American jobs eh? American #SolarEnergy company Suniva just filed for bankruptcy citing the tariffs as a direct cause. 100's lose their jobs. Oh, and China just told their farmers to increase soybean farming. Great job #MAGA

Having watched that video that you put on twitter, obama did not agree with @realDonaldTrump on immigration. Obama said illegal immigrants would be deported. Under trump, illegal immigrants are treated like dogs in cages in an animal pound.
@realDonaldTrump if a person rode the top of the subway with their CHILDREN youth protection wpuld remove those kids. If I was homeless youth protection would remove my kids. Why does an illegal immigrant get better treatment? Now it will be FAMILY centers. So a guaranteed bed

Trump loses his mind in a rally in Nevada, campaigning for Heller. He stoops once again to the lowest level by referring to a senate candidate by a derogatory name-demonizing the person because she is a democrat. That is the kind of America of @realdonaldtrump and @GOP . Vote Blue

Why are people surprised by @realDonaldTrump & his administration? They are only galvanising what the USA is, has been & always will be. A country built on the back of racism & regulated as such. Nothing has essentially changed, just exposed more.
So true, my family ALWAYS voted Democrat and my grandmother was very heavy in the local political races in my state. I was the one black sheep of the family voting republican. Then to my SHOCK they all voted for @realDonaldTrump !!! The Dems have to be real messed up indeed lol
@realDonaldTrump And every Republican who votes no should be voted out of office in November!
Thank you Red Hen for standing up for American principles. And letting the trumpsters know they will no less Niger be tolerated. @realDonaldTrump

You are complicit by not speaking out against the rhetoric from your dictator @realDonaldTrump
Bosio just admitted in his denial piece that he openly fat shamed our head athletic trainer by calling him fat. Nice guy . I notice he used the locker room talk excuse like the Fuhrer @realDonaldTrump . Makes me wonder why the Cubs suspended him for two weeks.
So @realdonaldtrump are you offering to get these fools out of jail for attempting to kill journalists? Because you have in the past when people spoke out at your rallies. Say how's that old freak's trial coming? Is he your campaign manager now?

@realDonaldTrump I am inspired by how unapologetically, consistently principled he is. No matter what. Doesn't matter what the trends in DC or Europe are. Carry that to need to reward law following, not breaking. Being principled renders the most gain.

And you thought coward @realDonaldTrump would step up and make an intelligent statement before he could find a way to make it about him because.......what?
@realDonaldTrump and his rhetoric have proven to be dangerous to citizens. @SpeakerRyan is complicit as he LET IT CONTINUE WITHOUT CENSURE!
@realDonaldTrump is basically a very troubled middle school mean girl, he (and others) scream from the mountaintops fabricating all sorts of nonsense about what democrats do and want done without ever having any proof beyond the fact that they made it up & these morons eat it up
Almost as wrongheaded as saying @DNC planned it, so the media would BLAME it on @realDonaldTrump . We are all Americans. We are not one another's enemy. There are enough people in this world that hate ALL of us, left and right!
@realDonaldTrump No love for the unloving. No civility for the uncivil No tolerance for the intolerant. No respect for the disrespectful.

But, @PressSec , didn't your boss, @realDonaldTrump , label the media the enemy of the people? You know, like the Nazis did.
@realDonaldTrump I watched Wray and Rosie today, Wray thinks he is Elliott Ness (Untouchable) and Rosiestein thinks it is funny that he is holding documents. Both are smug bureaucrats who think they are elite.

Hey Bernie, his beef with them started years ago, before @realDonaldTrump even thought to run for President. Nice try, but LAME.
Fact Check: 1) Obama & his Dem/Repub Congresses (w/ earlier contributions frm Clinton/Bush43) r 90% responsible 4 this; 2) @POTUS - but mostly ur current civil/refined GOPe heroes - can take credit for the rest, but ... 3) @realDonaldTrump has pledged never again. We'll see.
