Winner winner chicken dinner!! Thanks @realDonaldTrump and @GOP for #MAGA #Trump #TrumpTax
So I hear as well...BUT what's this crap about @POTUS @realDonaldTrump agreeing to REDACT NAMES of FBI & DOJ parties that were named in the criminal acts of committing fraud to the court??
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Another DACA arrested. @SenSchumer Tell me again America needs this. https://t.co/ynpfVe5omz?amp=1

And his dishonesty continues... it happens so often that @realDonaldTrump is unable to distinguish between fact and fantasy. He lives in an alternate universe. POTUS living in ANOTHER universe would be ideal.

How can humans differ so much. Every thing the @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Kelly Ann, Sarah, etc, say is an Accomplishment I find to be a complete and total FAILURE. Keep my meager tax cut and build infrastructure and stop #OffShoreDrilling . Then I will rethink the situation.

I would ask that everyone in the back ground just shut up until the memo is released. We have plenty of time before the election to get this straight. The U.S. public is not as stupid as a lot of you asses think. @realDonaldTrump Please give us the truth !!!!!
You're right @AriMelber . @realDonaldTrump really don't want EVERYTHING out including his 2017 Tax Return beside the ones that was filed before the election. #ReleaseTheDemMemo @GenJohnKelly

@realDonaldTrump My advice to the President is... If there is a single redaction do not release the Memo...
@donaldtrumpfire @realDonaldTrump . PRESIDENT. TRUMP...WE ARE TEAM UP.. YOU SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO DEFEAT ALL YOURS ENEMIES & OPPOSITION...INCLUDING FAKES. NEWS... THEY WANT TO IMPEACH TRUMP.. SO. WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP. DO NOTHING WITH ANYTHING OR.......USE PRESIDENT POWER

It's a lie Brit. And it is because @realDonaldTrump is a liar. Stop excusing and call it what it is
It's also possible that @realDonaldTrump will decide to not release the memo. This is because He is the only one that can protect the FBI. It is also significant that there are other docs out there that the White House doesn't want released. This administration is a SHIT SHOW.

There is no "precipice" other than the destruction of America by the FBI. #ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheNames @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP The FBI has mishandled investigations, far as I can see, into IRS, #Clinton , and #FISA disgrace. #Liars not to be trusted, IMO.
That's why New Yorkers don't get the full benefit of the @realDonaldTrump tax cuts.
So yet again something has happened that @realDonaldTrump can't make about him. Still silent on the shooting. Get the @NRA cock out of your ass and tell the @GOP to do something other then offer thoughts and prayers.
So the Clinton foundation got $145M, What Did The USA Receive? I mean it wasn't the Clinton's Uranium! I haven't heard anyone ask, or answer that question? #ReleaseTheMemos @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @JoeDanMedia

@realDonaldTrump wants 1.5 trillion for infrastructure which I'm about. How can we pay for this? Maybe by getting rid of the 1.5 trillion in tax cuts they just pushed through?

@realDonaldTrump The President is boxing in the DEM's. Blow after blow, DEM's taking a beating, left, right, and shots to the head. They're going down in the 1st. As they hit the mat they scream out Hillary's name.
#ReleaseTheMemo Redacting the memo is about as literal a COVER-UP as you can get, whether it is names being covered-up, or techniques corrupt agents used to subvert an election and later subvert a President. @realDonaldTrump chose THE U.S. PEOPLE over ABUSERS OF U.S. LAW.
I sincerely believe @realDonaldTrump is so stupid that he believed by threatening to release the (fake) memo, the FBI would call off Russia investigation. Now he's stuck with a dud (fake) memo, an enraged FBI &DOJ, and the VAST majority of Americans wanting him jailed. #winning
Of course it did.. @realDonaldTrump made it ok for Racists to spread their hate and he's backed them several times. Apparently this is how you MAGA .. by instilling hate propping up the racists!

I've seen a lot of 'don't look back on Bush nostalgically' after this bit. He was brutal. Occasionally talked a good game but his actions were fraught. Cheney, the Bush Whisperer. @realDonaldTrump is much worse which is frightening. His Whisperers are Putin and @StephenMillerAL
. @realDonaldTrump You're insane.
My thoughts are Peter Strzok was the FBI agent that brought this phoney dossier in front of FISA judge for the warrant to spy on @realDonaldTrump & his campaign. If this is true, the entire premise for the special council Russia probe is a lie & he should fire anyone who knew it!
Just wondering . @realDonaldTrump do you ever spend time with Barron? He's your youngest child. Or Tiffany...she's your other daughter.
Bye bye hope @realDonaldTrump

I would like to know why the hell the FBI had the right to even see the Memo. The FBI are the criminals here, and they have no right to voice their opinions on the matter. It's like asking Hillary what she thinks about it first before they release it. @realDonaldTrump
If @GOP and @realDonaldTrump are so interested in transparency why don't we get to see the moron's tax returns? That would be real transparency.
@realDonaldTrump Trump is this right ? >Ku Klux Klan stages an 'America First' parade in New York in the 1920s < this mean you have the " America first " taken from the KKK ! we know you are a racist! your Father was a big KKK member and you today a sympathetic ! A KKK President

Eric Holder was certainly on President Barack Obama's team, was he not? Pretty sure he said so. What kind of person constantly tries to tear down their President? @realDonaldTrump is a uniter not a divider.
Americans elected @realDonaldTrump because we want an efficient, functioning gov't. Send the social issues to city & local gov't. If dems think they're rhetoric will win them elections, they'll be very disappointed come Nov.

At 5:05 pm today on the @RodArquette Show: @RepChrisStewart on the possible release of a memo that accuses the @FBI of illegally spying on a @realDonaldTrump adviser

@realDonaldTrump Mr president, I think it only fair to give Hannity the exclusive on the release of the memo tonight as it is only his show that has exposed many of mis-doings in regards to the fbi/doj.
The rules mean nothing to @realDonaldTrump and his administration, that should be obvious by now.
@IngrahamAngle The US Gov't, at the Executive Privilege Level with full assistance of DOJ/FBI & DNC tried to FRAME #Dossier a private citizen @realDonaldTrump of #Treason while simultaneously illegally covering up the prosecution of #FugitiveHillary to advance her candidacy.
Obviously the @FBI is a fraud and needs to clean house, it is part of the executive branch @realDonaldTrump
@DevinNunes , you should ask yourself: Is a bloated, semiliterate sack of human waste like @realDonaldTrump really worth sacrificing your dignity for? #RemoveNunes

@realDonaldTrump Psssst watch out trump....they're all out to get you....even those you think are closest to you....watch out....check under the bed and behind each door.....scary times for you.....ooooo.....everyone says so.
Nah, @realDonaldTrump , YOU disgust us, not the greatness of America. Get it right for once
Couldn't agree with you more, but don't forget #DirtBagDevin #RepugnantRyan or #SenileMcConnell ! These Trumpzi stooges made all this treason possible. They will reap the consequences, & history's judgment will be HARSH, @realdonaldtrump !

@realDonaldTrump the memo is released and the lying media IS IGNORING IT AND STILL PUSHING THE FLASE RUSSIA PROBE!! What can you do next for the American people to wake up?
The power of the Memo isn't what's in it ~ it's what it allows @realDonaldTrump to DO FROM NOW, what it allows AG @jeffsessions to DO FROM NOW.
@realDonaldTrump The memo is a good start. Devon Nunez exonerates you via the dossier by denouncing its Validity. It shows a clear prejudice against you and a clear bias for Hillary, I know you're p***** and you should be, but don't fire anyone yet. Don't let Mueller trap you.
@realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes One big DUD. #GOPmemo pic.twitter.com/dDlKkyQ9jh

@realDonaldTrump It's been reported for months that Vladimir Putin is going to hack our 2018 mid-term election. With your "America First" stand, what have you & your Republican majorities in the House & Senate done to keep it from happening, as in the 2016 election?

@realDonaldTrump you are beyond a disgrace. You are disgusting.
Nunes/ @realDonaldTrump conspired to draw up a rational to fire of Mr. Rosenstein. The result is the Nunes Memo. It is the product of both Trump and Nunes and its intent was to give cover for Trump to fire Rosenstein so that he could appoint someone who would fire Mr. Mueller.

@realDonaldTrump To be clear, the @FBI used a fake report, written by foreign spy, paid for a politician under investigation by the FBI - and used the fake report as an excuse to spy on the political opposition and leak the #FakeNews to the press. @Comey says it was "no big deal"

@realDonaldTrump I'm really enjoying the Fire and Fury book by Wolff...have you read it?...oh right...you can't read. The book is available in audio version. Next I will read David Frum's book. You've provided fodder for some great reading.
Even though the Democrats are fighting like hell as the swamp is being drained I believe history will show that @realDonaldTrump did indeed #MAGA by putting #AmericaFirst . And we are fortunate enough to live through this historic era
Well happy times for all. @realDonaldTrump you're not a dictator but you are a major d**k.
Sanders never sold out. He called for a re-canvas after the suspicious circumstances surrounding the Kentucky primary. He did what he could without appearing as a "sore loser" and I am sure @SenSanders didn't want to give @realDonaldTrump more to attack Dems on in '16.

@realDonaldTrump
so why did @realDonaldTrump take 3 hours locked in a room with a three page memo that shows two of his premier aids had years and years of Russian ties? Republicans feel Hannity set Trump up, and Nunes is Mueller's obstruction spy. Who read the memo to him? 3 hours? Wow!!

Not even close to being as racist or sexist as @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump time to clean house at DOJ and nominate Trey Gowdy to run the DOJ as AG.

@realDonaldTrump has never taken the first step to stop or stand in the way of the investigation. That entire narrative comes from the left trying to taunt him into doing something they can pounce for. He'll let it play out, just so he can have the last laugh.

@realDonaldTrump Why no tweets of sympathy for the Italians terrorized by shooter? Oh, yes, sorry, the shooter was a white supremacist Nazi lover firing at the lesser races, like immigrants from shithole countries. You are an enemy of the USA.

@realDonaldTrump my wife who rarely ever says anything mean about anyone just called you a "fat lobster " in regards to whether melania she leave you. She said Melania should do herself a favor and leave that fat lobster. Now that's rich .
Muslim Brotherhood always at the ready to pay for these terrorists defense and they are doing it on Tax payers dime and thru programs like Visa Lottery/Chain migration, all with Obama Admin blessings! @realDonaldTrump
. @realDonaldTrump promised to pass immigration reform that put interests of American workers first. The White House proposal is amnesty FIRST with relief for American workers LATER. Please support H.R. 4760 instead! #KeepYourPromise

@PressSec You know whose numbers are in the tank? @realDonaldTrump He needs to apologize for his outrageous comments yesterday and you should stop lying for him. Gross.
So now @realDonaldTrump want to have a North Korea type weapon parades..... Why???? Americans Honor Our Military heroes , not our Military weapon.... Ditators do that
Mr. President @realDonaldTrump , you may be a good negotiator but this time there is no "Art of the Deal". These criminals don't play your games. Don't do the interview. Everyone keeps trying to tell you that.
@realDonaldTrump
. @realDonaldTrump Any DACA deal must provide immediate relief to American workers and communities. Only Rep. Goodlatte's H.R. 4760 would do that. #KeepYourPromise

@realDonaldTrump Blast from the past... I remember during the campaign, Hillary had more subscribers on Reddit for "Hillary for Prison" than "Hillary for President. If Hillary was lucky she had a few hundred attend her rallies. Most likely only got 38% of the real vote.

DACA was an illegal executive order a breach of Presidents vows and an impeachable offense. @realDonaldTrump couldn't extend it even if he wanted to. Democrats would use it to impeach him
Of course. The @GOP is full of sociopaths like @realDonaldTrump They can never take blame for mistakes. Sad. Luckily most will be thrown out in November

@realDonaldTrump -I would love to have a military parade. It would NOT be political!! It would honor our brave Patriotic Americans
@JoeBiden your childish rhetoric towards @realDonaldTrump the 45th President is showing how sad u really ARE. You're nothing but a punchline & a joke. You & lying @BarackObama TOTALLY screwed our country up. PS if u think you're tough guy - wrong. You're a joke #MAGA #realnews
@realDonaldTrump we need that wall
So as the world constantly #protests @realDonaldTrump he decides to throw a #parade and use the #military for his own benefit
Really #DemoRats ! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump done more in a year than @POTUS44 Hussein @BarackObama in 8 years whose terms an utter failure! #DrainTheSewer #BuildTheWall #MAGA pic.twitter.com/9fb1bPqCB6

@realDonaldTrump NOT a good idea to have military parade. Think what we could lose if we were attacked at the parade. Costs too much money when 20 trillion in debt.
Dopo il riporto di @realDonaldTrump avremo finalmente una puntata di #lineanotte dedicata ai peli grigini della "vagiaina" di @BotteriGiovanna? Ho il diritto di saperlo!

Amazing how they are blaming this on @realDonaldTrump when it was Obama who used an executive order rather than passing it through Congress
I believe there is a method to EVERY move @realDonaldTrump makes...and I would place a bet that this is no different.. He is a strategic, mastermind and he KNOWS we are strong and would like us all to appreciate and celebrate our military to let them know!
What about the #RussianSanctions What happens is @realDonaldTrump never actually implements them?
But how is he going to stand up for that long with his bone spurs? @realDonaldTrump
Things that won't happen: @realDonaldTrump 's tax returns, Melania's proof she didn't work in the US illegally, a pre-announced official Trump visit to London, a military parade that would turn out 92% of the DC population in protest, a useless border wall.
@TruthinGov2016 Blocked for being a Bot & for supporting V. Putin's Manchurian Candidate, cowardly treasonous dickless @realDonaldTrump non- @POTUS illegal squatter @WHITEHOUSE whom, by the way, is still married to an active Porn star,
No more than @realDonaldTrump is to be sure.
@realDonaldTrump spend the money to help the military families and the veterans instead of your stupid parade to satisfy your ego.

So @realDonaldTrump 's plan for #DreamActNow is forced conscription, do I have that right? http:// politi.co/2EPlhq6 Because that worked great for the roman empire. Almost as good as military parades. When do these folks quit and start the first order?
Remember @ChrisMurphyCT you are a politician and @realDonaldTrump is the successful businessman, so sit down and shut up!
@realDonaldTrump / you should have a press conference explaining the visa lottery, chain migration, the end of the DACA program & why they are so problematic for the nation's welfare, and why a wall is so important to the nation's overall economy & sovereignty.
So where or what were you doing whole year why do nothing then try to shut down. Shows real actions of senate. Do nothing. @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @VP a very sad example of democracy. More banana republic.

@realDonaldTrump does not want to prove he is right. He wants others to accept that he is right simply on the basis that he said (or tweeted it, as is mainly the case.) Then there is no cost to his convictions, as no one in power will hold him accountable.
The pple arnd @realDonaldTrump act like the parent of a really spoiled,bratty child who is always getting in trouble but they always find a way to excuse his bad http:// behavior.No more time outs. Whip his behind.
Back peddling because he now sees how difficult the situation is and his notion that he could fix it was so uneducated and naive. @realDonaldTrump now blaming someone else instead of admitting he was wrong. Go figure.

My family and I pray daily for President Trump and family... America is truly behind @realDonaldTrump God Bless!

@realDonaldTrump is so stupid.
I wonder who made them tweet this @realDonaldTrump ??
In case you didn't know, the #TrumpBudget is on course to lower the nation's DEBT! http:// usdebtclock.org . This is WHY @BarackObama is tweeting against @RealDonaldTrump BECAUSE he doesn't understand what debt means. Remember, #obama made MORE DEBT than ALL #POTUS ' COMBINED! #MAGA
I am sure @realdonaldtrump sees himself as a victim. After all, people have accused him, and he denies it, but they keep accusing him.
That is all DemocRATS know what to do when they lose, cry and lie about others! @maga @gop @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @dnc @IngrahamAngle @LouDobbs @cnn @JudgeJeanine @JesseBWatters

@realDonaldTrump Stop spending!
@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats . - Schiff has a lot of nerve flapping his gums when everyone gas seen the proof of him trying to collude with Russians to get phiny dirt on @realDonaldTrump . He should be investigated and punished.
This is how the tax cut should have been distributed @gop cult leader @realDonaldTrump $1,5 trillion divided by 126 million households makes for a nice $11,884 per house hold or close to $3,000 per year for four years.
@realDonaldTrump Can I give you a piece of advice? Stop hiring assholes and stop expecting loyalty from the people you (read: the people) hire. You serve the Constitution, not yourself.

The infrastructure bill is not 1.5 trillion directly out of the federal Treasury. Again a very modest increase in the gasoline tax will be proposed somewhere between 5 and $0.10. That will stop any debt. @realdonaldtrump will get the deal done. We elected him to make deals.
BS. Security clearances for folks who don't beat their wives, lie on their disclosure forms and have conflicts up the ying yang take the same as always. @RealDonaldTrump is running a right-wing gangsta white house.
"nuanced"? more like "bullcrap" Anyone who believes @realDonaldTrump is on the verge of systematically exterminating 11 million of his own people is either full of shite, or delusionally schizophrenic. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume you are former.

45 days into 2018 and already 7 school shootings. 20 killed, dozens injured. This cannot be tolerated anymore. When will our government pick the safety of our children over money from the NRA? @realDonaldTrump enough with your prayers. The time for gun control is now.

One thing we all know is true: @realDonaldTrump is owned by @NRA to the tune of 35 million $$ and Russia for some unknown amount. HE WILL DO NOTHING!
@realDonaldTrump ... Liar-in-Chief. Complicit. Fact.
@realDonaldTrump how many children are going to have to die due to school shootings before you actually do something?? Asking for a friend

Remember that @realDonaldTrump has filed for bankruptcy as often has he filed for military deferments. He's a con man and a coward. He has no idea how to effectively run a business. Why would he expect him to understand running a country or balancing its budget?

@realDonaldTrump and his republican minions want to replace food stamps with Blue Apron like boxes of food. Maybe they could use Soylent Green instead. Ship a few chips of Soylent Green at a low postage rate and problem solved.

Another sad day in America. I can't see it becoming great again whilst kids can kill kids & kids get massacred in school. My heart goes out to all those affected by this horrible tragedy. No doubt; 1) @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will claim "fake news" 2) @NRA will want more guns
Wow. So inexpensive? Thought acting like a third world dictatorship would cost more. And only puts a relatively little more in debt. Wow. @GOP @realDonaldTrump
The US Military spends over $1B in advertising each year. Spending $10-30M for a National Parade would bring a far greater ROI for recruitment and national pride. @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs
Dear @realDonaldTrump It's 8 months & 3 weeks until the #BlueWave . Enjoy your hateful agenda Relish the pain & misery your sadistic ego likes to inflict on the poor & the weak Because what you have to look forward to is your impeachment & imprisonment when the Dems take control.

@realDonaldTrump Innocent kids like myself, kids with hopes and dreams and bright futures, died yesterday at the hands of a man who should not have had AN ASSAULT RIFLE in the first place. Want to make a difference and help the American people? Enforce gun control.

I have an idea @realDonaldTrump : How about @GOP passes a bill that picks the number of children who must DIE in their schools before you'll f-ing DO SOMETHING to stop the gun #epidemic in this country? How about it? How many? HOW MANY?? We hit that number, YOU act. Whaddya think?
@realDonaldTrump I am tweeting this as a concerned American. I am a 20 year old college student who would like to offer insight concerning the recent school shooting and mass shooting in general. Why not hire veterans and retired police officers and arm them to guard the schools?

#Parkland . Did you think @realDonaldTrump would show empathy? Compassion or offer solutions? He's angry he can't golf
One thing is for sure, if the shooter had been Muslim or illegal immigrant, @realDonaldTrump would have been tweeting and @FoxNews would have been reporting it before the last bullet was fired.

What's your childish Nic name for Putin , @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ?
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to demand that Vladimir Putin extradite the Russians charged with election meddling crimes so they may be tried in the US? A true patriot devoted to our democracy, and a president with real power and nothing to hide, would do that. If not, why not?
This is not going away. We need action! @RepJasonLewis @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr #DoNothingJason #mn02 #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
I find it actually shocking that people don't believe in gun regulation. Like actually crazy. Reading Facebook debates and Twitter threads this past week has made my brain explode. And don't get me started on @realDonaldTrump .
And #Leftists #Progressives #Democrats wonder why #Evangelicals support @RealDonaldTrump http:// bit.ly/2FeWI64
@realDonaldTrump And the only reason he had to mention #Parkland was to try to blame others. What a coward.

He never said Russia didn't meddle, @realDonaldTrump just said he trusted Putin's denial of meddling... duhhhh that's like not even the same story its not like both have anything to do with an enemy power trying to subvert our democracy or anything like that.... #fakenews
@FactCurmudgeon @realDonaldTrump It's not " #Whataboutism , it's fact; the Dems did 0. As long as Dems pretend otherwise, reminder "Whataboutism" implies that one ignores wrong "X" because wrong "Y" exists; I haven't done that. The @GOP must now do what the Dems never tried to do.
@realDonaldTrump keep your kids at home
Remember, @realDonaldTrump doesn't care one bit what you say/do so don't be shocked by him. He took office only to put in place changes to expand his/cronies wealth. After he's gone, he will just be richer and happier. Regardless of what we lose #Trump
Very SAD! @realDonaldTrump the worst thing that ever happened to America!
President Trump does not want to punish Russia for its electoral interference. He has made this clear by his words and his lack of actions. His refusal to enforce the sanctions and his continual praise of Putin. @realDonaldTrump @VP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr #PutinsPuppet

@realDonaldTrump , you should disband the secret service and ask your aupporters for thier thoughts and prayers in protecting you if you think thoughts and prayers will save us from gun violence.
Has anyone else noticed a spike in the volume and insanity of @realDonaldTrump 's tweets before every single big development in the Russia investigation? Can one of you more statistically inclined peeps make a chart?

Linda @realDonaldTrump is planning a DIALOG day with students from #parklandhighschool How you see that going?
There's a difference between someones public opinion and just being straight un-American. There's also a big difference between not supporting our President Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ,) and being an unpatriotic asshole. For example, I didn't vote Trump, but won't bash our leader.

@realDonaldTrump You really are a coward for not meeting with high school kids. What are your bone spurs bothering you? You are a ChickenS...
Have you not listened to your own reports? The boy was nothing but warning signs , I hope one day that the counselors at schools actually listen to the students, they cry out and people turn their backs , I witnessed it daily @realDonaldTrump
Thanks for confirming Russian meddling @realDonaldTrump ... sanctions next then ?!

@realDonaldTrump Why can't monitors be set up in a room with security cameras at all exits and pkg lots at schools? Hire a person to monitor this full time. All states have lottery games with a percentage going to education that could help to cover the costs.

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Vice News, weekdays @7:30 on HBO.
@TheBeatWithAri what an amazing show tonight! Each of your guests were so authentic. Wow, each of your segments were so informative! @realDonaldTrump & administers Past & Present should be scared. BTW FL @GOP VOTED AGAINST A DEBATE ON GUN REFORM
You are a FN liar about everything! @realDonaldTrump
@TheBeatWithAri @realDonaldTrump cannot be #blackmailed when it involves women. Blackmail requires shame. He has no respect for women therefore no shame in lying, cheating or treating them badly. Now, if we're talking about *finances*, well, that's entirely different...
We must make schools safe NOW! Metal detectors must be out in place, armed security officers and locked doors! This is the first step in keeping students safe! @realDonaldTrump
Will the backlash of @realDonaldTrump and all the stupid things he says and does actually motivate peoples voice to make a positive change or like the ME TO movement will things go to far Left

@PressSec Why the discomfort signal in your body language right before you start talking? Experts note that people will often rub their face to comfort or to calm themselves down. Could it be that you are stressed because of your continuous lies to cover up for @realDonaldTrump ?

Such a small measure by an insecure small POS who likes thing big... @realDonaldTrump proves that the loud-mouths are the ones packing the smallest "brains".
@realDonaldTrump has lost a 2020 vote for 2nd amendment infringement. ZERO pro gun regulations, except ONE anti gun move.

@realDonaldTrump . Pro-gun crazies on social media are in reality, very real, very scary and very brainwashed people. The scale of the problem in the USA is beyond belief. Yet you just sit back, blame others and play golf. Oh, and endorse the NRA. To be clear: Britain hates you.
@realDonaldTrump we don't want the Graham immigration plan! We want DACA ppl to have a path to LEGALIZATION but not citizenship!! They should NOT be allowed to such off our taxpayers money w/o paying into it.
I try everyday for @realDonaldTrump to block me! Wear that as a badge of honor. Not seeing his tweets anymore would truly be a wish come true.
@realDonaldTrump Shame on you for hiding behind the 17 deaths in Florida and using it as a distraction to attack the FBI for investigating you. You are such a coward you fat orange asshole and you are not distracting anyone with your fake news.!
It is not often that I agree with @realDonaldTrump . Banning bump stocks is the right thing to do, and I applaud his directive to the Department of Justice.

@realDonaldTrump is a hypocrite. He is also a suspect to be compromised . He is in the hip pocket of Putin. He has been described as treasonous. Five I's need to come toward him. Investigation, Interrogate him, Indict him and others, Impeach and Incarcerate him.
@realDonaldTrump I am stick & tired of liberals & ugly obama throwing white people under the bus. White people need to start sticking together because the blacks stand with blacks, muslims for muslims & Mexicans for Mexicans. Whites stand with your white self.

Way to go , @realDonaldTrump you totally addressed that Vegas shooting from last year. #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump Good job on the bump stocks. Im a registered Republican and pro 2nd amendment. Get rid of the AR's too. Only police and military need that power. Keep it up. We will win if you do and say the "right" things.
So glad you're not too insecure to give to such a great cause. Will @realDonaldTrump match you and the Clooney's? #NotHoldingMyBreath Thanks @Oprah !

@NRA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS buying automatic weapons must have 30 day check with FBI and Police - no person can just walk in and buy automatic immediatly plus not to be sold to people under 25 years old. Not taking anyone's rights away just being more careful.
@SenatorCollins @leonpanetta wonders on CNN if @realDonaldTrump is keeping his oath of office. Is he just a party hack or a dedicated public servant and truth teller?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @wolfblitzer @AC360 @donlemon TRUMP BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY NRA, $30.6 million from NRA! Trump illiterate too!
What @realDonaldTrump needs to do is deport EVERYBODY. Then America can truly start to be great again. #maga #americawasntmadebyimmigrants
No. Arming teachers is a non-starter, @realDonaldTrump . We want solutions, not scams that funnel public education money to gun manufacturers.
@realDonaldTrump so if arming teachers is the solution to a school shooting, doesn't that mean that the solution to a school fire is for teachers to light another fire?
Only a total #trumphole would need to be reminded to hear people. Shallow agenda for a shallow man. #illegitimateDon @realDonaldTrump Trump's note card for Parkland shooting discussion: 'I hear you' @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2ETNT49
Horrible enough to put black children in classrooms with racist teachers, but giving those racists the right to show up armed and threaten those children is high up on the white supremacists wishlist. So of course @realDonaldTrump and @GOP are all for it.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Nicole Hockley from S-Hook was not practical. yes, they have done things BUT there are ppl not going to school, hooked on opiods,gangs etc. They could head toward the school to harm. Secure the schools-more than 1 guard. Retired Mid-age vets-employ them!!
@realdonaldtrump didn't lie this time. He literally did 'hear' them but we know he and the #GOP will wait out this news cycle and nothing will change. Thankfully, things are changing at many state levels & I welcome all those awesome teens to the Democratic party. #VoteBlue
Honestly, @realDonaldTrump is a complete idiot, who in their right mind would think that more guns is the solution. So teachers won't try to protect the children, instead children will try to dodge not only the bullets from the shooter, but bullets from the teachers guns as well.
Who the fuck needs "Cliff's Notes" to convey compassion, empathy, and decency??? Ahhhhh.... yes, @realDonaldTrump does. #CliffNotes #CribSheet #Dotard
The teenagers held their own without notes ... @realDonaldTrump needs to be coached
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I propose armed security at schools perhaps some retired vets or police. Every professional building in NYC has a guard who meets you when you enter. I would give Police the right to stop and frisk also.
And, I can recall several teachers I wouldn't want handling a sharp object!!! @realDonaldTrump negotiates a way with #GOP and #NRA to increase the revenue to offset Congress increasing the age from 18-21. Genius. #GunControlNow #NeverAgainMSD

And when did you @realDonaldTrump start having "Business meetings" with Russian Mafia and Oligarchs? Probably long before that! You have had way tooo many unaccompanied meetings with Russians to be believed! And you had at least 1 after election! What about that?

@realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews #StudentsStandUp Tip number 4 - Every school has an anonymous 'Domestic Terror Marshall' hidden on faculty. (Not concealed carry for teachers)
Isn't it odd that @POTUS wants to destroy or be tougher with everything that @BarackObama did? Healthcare, debt, Iran deal, global warming? When it comes to Russia though... @realDonaldTrump looks like a total bitch
@realDonaldTrump 1. Who buys the weapons? 2. AR 15 v 9 mill? 3. If collateral damage is teacher/school liable? 4. Who pays for insurance? 5. What happens if kid overpowers teacher & takes Weapon? Finally, the attack was 2 min long. Arming teach not answer
Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump in-laws are here under the immigration program. And they must be real scumbags, cause Don said countries don't send you their best.

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump
The NRA just put out the dumbest self serving "warning" aimed at POTUS not to mess with their age limits. So @realDonaldTrump ...show us you're the badass you keep claiming to be and stand up to this selfish juggernaut. #saveourkids

@realDonaldTrump Arming teachers sucks. they have to get the kids out of harms way not engage in a gun battle where they are out gunned, lack the element of surprise and risk that kids will be killed in the exchange.. Obviously you were not in the military and have no clue
@realDonaldTrump your physical stance says fucking everything. Unfold your arms when you speak, to children ESPECIALLY!! I Loathe you
Retweeted Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ): Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the... https:// fb.me/Wmqs4LqG
@realDonaldTrump do even 1 of these 3 things and we can start to make change. 1. Instill buy back for all firearms 2. Those caught with any firearms after the buy back period jailed for a minimum of 3 years. 3. Ammunition prices are to be raised to $25 per bullet.
@realDonaldTrump suggestion,,buzz to get In and it of classrooms,buzzers on teachers desk and visual of halls via laptop all hooked up safe
I applaud @realDonaldTrump for allowing the cameras to stay during his session on school shootings. These unscripted moments are important for the nation to witness.

Nothing gets pass @thehill . Eat your tweet @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump good idea to arm teachers who are there to teach students to learn, not for them to learn how to shoot and carry guns! More money for #nra welll done you fucking #orangefuktard #fatnixon #impeachment
@realDonaldTrump Assault weapons don't belong in our homes and NO WEAPONS belong in our schools. The amount of training needed to fire accurately under stress would not leave time in the day for teaching.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I am a gun owner and would like to say that the age for "assault" weapons should be set at 25
Ideas, ideas, ideas. Yes more ideas idiot in chief. U need to join Toast Masters to learn how to speak. Then take a class on empathy and compassion. Have friends who could help u @realDonaldTrump

Why stop there, @realDonaldTrump Trump, arm the children too! Let's lower the CW age and let kiddos get their hands full. A school full of guns should keep them all safe, right?
@realDonaldTrump I would expect you to feel even more so about our own Country's children who are being gunned down at schools. Proper response would be: Ban AR's. These are weapons of war. No one needs them outside of the military.
This is the perfect example what kind of person Trump is. No empathy at all! I'm very mad and not even American... #ihearyou And @realDonaldTrump , let me repeat the wise words of @lauferlaw : Go FUCK yourself!

@realDonaldTrump It is your obligation and duty to investigate and prosecute those behind the shootings . Florida shooter wanted to be a professional shooter and walked out with students not expecting to die. Who employed him?
The only reason @realDonaldTrump didn't invite Wayne LaPierre to today's listening session is nobody in the Trump White House was sure how to spell @NRA .

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump so ur answer is more guns??? How stupid are you?? You are the worst human being ever. Just do the USA a favor and resign #UnfitForOffice #TrumpIsAMoron
@Potus @realDonaldTrump Your answer to school massacre is to arm teachers & put more guns in schools. What does that say about our country & society? Instead of progressing, are we regressing to the Wild West with assault weapons? Is that your vision? #Trump #guns #Florida #GOP
i wish i had a dick, so i could tell @realDonaldTrump to suck it
See, @realDonaldTrump says something so incredibly tactless and stupid that were all laughing at that instead of focusing on the fact that these mass shootings are happening at an astonishing rate and @NRA is paying politicians to not do a thing.
Your #ListeningSession made U look like a bigger IDIOT than U already R @realDonaldTrump Just go away. How much can Americans PAY for @POTUS Trump to RESIGN quietly & go to Russia in exile
@realDonaldTrump why don't you use the National Guard to Monitor and keep our school safe Instead of weekend warrior Duty
President @realDonaldTrump @VP Pence thank you for having the #ListeningSession today while my heart broke for the kids, parents and families it was nice to see diverse ideas actually be listened too!
@realDonaldTrump I started my life out of High school starting to work on a man's security ward of a mental institution 1976.. Vo-tech senior yr a plus. After institutions shut down, I worked in group homes. Public safer with institutions, group home waste too much money.. #maga

I am disgusted at the "solutions" that @realDonaldTrump concocted in his "remember to say I Hear You" session today. Teachers are paid educators, not assassins or security guards. Parents should not have to choose schools by their "impressive arsenals." #ParklandStudentsSpeak pic.twitter.com/yW9lUlInKp
So, in other words, you want guns in the classroom, despite saying that you didn't last year. Good talk, @realDonaldTrump .
For those critics of @realDonaldTrump when did 44 sit down and listen and talk w the victims looking for solutions and how to move forward? Your Trump Derangement Syndrome is showing, again.
So @realDonaldTrump is afraid of @Emma4Change . What a cravenly little worm of a man. #ListeningSession #GunReformNow

@realDonaldTrump question....did you hear them? Or did you need to look at your notes to remind yourself?
@realDonaldTrump I watched Andrew Pollack's powerful plea for a change to protect the kids at school & he was right to focus on practical protection. Armed guards for every school in the land, adequately armed to halt any such attack..? It costs, but lives have no price.

@RealDonaldTrump : The NRA has a huge membership and can get involved in protecting school children. NRA Members could be Checked Out and Certified to be an "NRA School Protection Force" member. This would also help the NRA gain support and popularity with Liberals. @VP @GOP
@realDonaldTrump The fact that the last "note" is I hear you??? You need to remind yourself to make sure to make someone feel heard??? Its the fact that it wont come naturally, that gets me, others wrote that, and they knew you werent getting it

The fact that @realDonaldTrump even thinks that arming teachers is a good idea is absolutely insane, wtf goes through your head??

@realDonaldTrump while arming teachers sounds great, you will have issues with that. The CA muslims shot people at workplace. Put the retired & qualified vets to work.
Idiot @realDonaldTrump : If your answer to this Listening Session is to arm teachers and turn schools into prisons, children will just not be going to school.
So why was he and Emma Gonzalez not at the meeting today with the President if they are so passionate about the President making changes in Gun Laws and showing the public that they are real students at Parkland? @Potus @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump suggests arming teachers ! Has he even consulted with teachers unions ? I have never heard a more ludicrous idea to REDUCE gun violence. There could be gun fights in elementary schools. Around panicked kids and other adults. The man has a brain the size of a pea

@realDonaldTrump is a dip shit
@realDonaldTrump Arming teachers is not the answer. More guns lead to more deaths. We already have 300 million guns in this country. We need to address the lax gun safety laws, a weak gun registration system, need for research, and mushrooming sales of military assault weapons.
@realDonaldTrump You have to be one of the stupidest bastards on earth. How the hell can you call for arming teaches and janitors. Are you not listening. These kids don't want guns in their fucking schoolos you piece of shit.

Why 45 on his sleeve? Because it is all about @realDonaldTrump and his huge ego!
What? You want to arm our teachers with guns? Are they going to be Rambo Teacher with an assault rifle or a gun that shoots off a few rounds? Don't forget that the killer is armed with an assault rifle that shoots off 30+ rounds or 100 rounds. What's the point? @realDonaldTrump
It's shameful that @realDonaldTrump pushed #nralies that arming teachers would stop other attacks. He's so full of shit. Teachers would have their hands full just keeping students safe. There is ZERO proof that would have stopped this or any attack. And probably more people die.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump please put Bibles back in schools, this will help stop these murders, along with arming school personal. When the goodness of GOD was taken so was values of our people. Thank you for being a great president, you have the guts to get things done.

This way, the @gop @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump budget that slashes money for school security can leverage existing teachers to be sharpshooters. Fantasy land economics and fantasy land security. But they will keep getting NRA $. That's their real priority.
@realDonaldTrump Pick up the phone & have a long chat to former PM Mr John Howard.
@realDonaldTrump there WAS an armed police officer at Douglas the day of the shooting and it didn't help, proving the fact that having weapons on school grounds will NOT solve this problem. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow

The trained, armed county deputy on duty at the school didn't even go inside when the shooting started, but @realDonaldTrump thinks that arming teachers will end school shootings.

@realDonaldTrump rather than supporting more guns, lets discuss all options privately..give the public a window of a plan.. day to day updates only adds confusion.. also lets think out of the box... an idea i have... simple quick and will support all sides...
A trained resource deputy wouldn't go in to try to save lives @realDonaldTrump but we should arm teachers.
@realDonaldTrump Presidents don't make history; they rise to the occasion when defining moments present themselves. This is your moment. You have the chance to go down in history as the president who made the country safe again by brokering common-sense gun laws. Don't f-up.

@realDonaldTrump This is not an issue of age, guns, NRA, or military service. It is a failure of GOVERNMENT. A 2013 amendment to NICS Act failed (before the last presidential election) that would have closed gaps in the system, 48-52. Guess who voted against it. DEMOCRATS.
What I saw was @realDonaldTrump spinning like a drunk, dancing on a bar at a frat party under the misguided belief that people were laughing with him, not at him. #CleanCoal with applause or were they booing #BlackLungKills ? I know he doesn't read, but he gets news brief, right?

President Pants on Fire @realDonaldTrump has been suspiciously quiet today. A lot has happened to expose him as a fraud and threat to our democracy this weekend. What kind of evil is he planning on unleashing tomorrow when he gets back to his hack duties (after 11am, of course)
@realDonaldTrump doesn't read, everyone knows. What he doesn't seem to know is by not reading he is relying on people who are lying to him about what is in those reports. Sad.

@realDonaldTrump I can't believe you criticized those deputy sheriff's you shriveled dick bastard. Go and run into a school the next time there is a shooting and do us all a favor.
@60Mins Liked the NZ @JacindaArdern interview. Very much looking forward to seeing @charleswooley interview US president @realDonaldTrump near future. Hope it will be just as good as @piersmorgan did.

Hey @realDonaldTrump how about harnessing that bravery of tackling a shooter unarmed and using it to tackle the NRA fanatics sending death threats - without a shred of irony - to MSD school shooting survivors?
As would any parent or grandparent amen President Trump @realDonaldTrump
Yawn, the election is all about @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump YOUR golden shower was salacious and unverified! LAWDY There are tapes! Not the entire dossier! GET a CLUE! If you don't want the FBI nosing around your files, DON'T HIRE KNOWN RUSSIAN AGENTS FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN! BIGLY mistake!
Pres @realDonaldTrump should get on the teevee and do nothing but swing nunchucks for like 5 minutes. No talking, just swinging nunchucks. And maybe make some kung fu sounds and talk about how Obama killed his sensei.
But I thought everything @realDonaldTrump does is divinely inspired??
@realDonaldTrump Bone spurs and all. Go for it ! pic.twitter.com/aC9l3qpbcn
@DianeBlackTN what about him? I saw your tv ad where you stood with @realDonaldTrump on tax cuts. In your ad you specifically said you "did it for her". But what about the him? What about us as a whole? I think your ad sends a one sided message that could cost you.
It gets better.. There were 3 shooters & 'The Army'. Hope the blonde girl who said she was with him while someone was shooting doesn't get suicided. #TheGreatAwakening @realDonaldTrump https:// youtu.be/eWUrLbTVrDw

Today in @realDonaldTrump word salad re school safety he said we need to change our culture. I agree but he doesn't believe what he's saying. He's done nothing, in fact only accelerated hate among people toward others. He can't even be civil to others in public service R or D

@realDonaldTrump If DACA was a directive of Obama and not a law it can be reversed! Time to get your steel balls out and reverse DACA now! If have to then fight it in the courts. I say reverse it, what will happen? You will force supreme court to do their JOB! #EndDACA

@realdonaldtrump would run into an active shooter situation? hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahohahahohohahaha. stop! Can he even run with those bone spurs?
When Howard Stern told @realDonaldTrump he thought Ivanka was hot, he reacted by agreeing and saying he'd "date" her. Who's inappropriate now, Deary?

To have that much going on in your life and you become this ignorant shell. So privileged and so vindictive. That's where entitlement and greed lead you. May you live long enough @realDonaldTrump to see it done much better.
Reminder: @IvankaTrump is as much a feminist as @realDonaldTrump is courageous. That is to say that they're both chock full of platitudes, hypocrisy, and bullshit.

@realDonaldTrump Why is no one talking about assigning the National Guard to guard our schools? It seems that should fall in their job description.
@IvankaTrump is a daughter in the @WhiteHouse nothing more. She has no experience doing anything she claims to be an advocate for, & outside of tweeting, has done nothing to add value. She is there to protect herself & Jared, and the Trump organization from @realDonaldTrump
#IvankaTrump the question you were asked on MSM is so insulting to you and your family. That's why I don't watch #MSM . I stand behind you and your family. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump funny how green cards are ok as long as they support your bank account. @maddow @CNN @Lawrence do you guys remember hearing anything about this?

But, some of that $30 million came from Russia, didn't it? @realDonaldTrump doesn't want to make his buddy Vlad angry. He certainly doesn't want to make any of the @NRA guys with guns mad either. Since they're all overcompensating for their own shortcomings, they get mad easily.
NO, not everyone 1. Feels @realDonaldTrump did anything wrong. In fact, HE is the victim 2. Thinks its OK to be disrespectful to another, especially an elder, just because you're angry or upset 3. Thinks the NRA is an evil entity. In fact, the NRA are simply American citizens
@realDonaldTrump looks like the Dems knew something you didnt about DACA. #SupremeCourt

How is this not considered an act of war by Russia against America and yet our leaders do nothing about it. Amazing and incredibly sad. @realDonaldTrump - what about those sanctions???

@wolfblitzer @BobSMueller What if @realDonaldTrump was in such financial trouble somewhere that he did what @jaredkushner did to get loans so as to avoid bankruptcy? Could it be that Kushner did so because that is what his father in law said would work?
Odds of Kushner not being given access to anything @realDonaldTrump wants him to see are about as good as <blank>. Nope, they're not good unless the push continues for him to be removed completely from a WH position. And he needs to take his wife with him.
sure am tired of waiting for @realDonaldTrump to be arrested. #AmericaHatesTreason #Mueller #MuellerTime #MuellerIsComing #TrumpColluded #TRAITOR #TrumpCrimeFamily
@realDonaldTrump I hope that is fake news. Death penalty for drug dealers? You would be killing a lot of white suburban people. Iran/contra bleeds into the CIA.
The Vegas shooter and Parkland shooter were both @realDonaldTrump supporters. The Planned Parenthood shooter was a Christian Conservative. The kid who shot 9 people in a black church was part of an online community on Storm Front. @tedcruz took money from the guy who runs it.
Today would be a great day for @realDonaldTrump to decide he really is an American and not a russian operative, afterall. Hardly likely, but sure would be nice.
@realDonaldTrump thrives on "drama" as long as he's the star of it. He can't bear not being the center of attention. Weakest Most Insecure President Ever.

@realDonaldTrump THANK YOU so much @POTUS for running in 2020. We the people need you. Hopefully you will start to drain the swamp. Bring in the military to get it started. @HillaryClinton needs to pay for her crooked doings.
This is exactly why the @POTUS should not make statements on issues and events where the facts aren't fully known. @realDonaldTrump just makes a fool of himself, and by association, all Americans. It is baffling that his ego is so frail he thinks he needs to interject on so much.
My prayer for @realDonaldTrump was for the weight of the job to press him to his knees. The Christians of this Nation overwhelmingly chose Trump over HRC. Confusing? It isn't to us. Weird? Heck yeah! But, God is confusing to those who are not inspired by His Spirit. I trust Him.
Does @realdonaldtrump know ANYONE who is NOT an active criminal?
@realDonaldTrump ok Mr trump you tweeter account is saying you or the real Donald Trump,so listen up Jerry brown of California is releasing criminal back in the city then we have gangs coming into the country, along with terrorist and all democrat can think about is our guns

Right which @realDonaldTrump will be in tomorrow... can you say DACA #DoSomething
2/2 @realDonaldTrump loves his children & grandchildren - he's never had a day when they weren't protected by armed security. I would like the same protection for my child & any other young adult living on their own. Not *everyone* under 21 is living in their parents' basement.
@realDonaldTrump I've supported you so far..but keep your hands off the 2nd Amendment.
@realDonaldTrump right again @Rosie is a disgusting pig pic.twitter.com/EXNAcvHAbM
@realDonaldTrump warhead chemical weapons with no sleeplessness, we will end the world! hurry up! ! There is no time! !
William Jefferson Clinton continued to run and manage the COUNTRY while Ken Start was investigating him and while the REPUBLICANS impeached him! @realDonaldTrump does not want to get anything done! And you all are his scapegoats! Sad!
Time for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to hire an Attorney General who is willing AND able to perform his job requirements and uphold America's Constitution. We had 8 years with 2 AGs who didn't seem to understand that.
Did @realDonaldTrump just lose his base caving to the dems?
So finally America under @realDonaldTrump You have achieved it... The End of #Hope #HopeHicks
This is because @realDonaldTrump does nothing to stand up to the racists and anti semites of this country. They are his core supporters!! #veryfinepeople Anti-Semitic incidents surged nearly 60% in 2017 - CNNhttps://apple.news/AFggmxkSeRNyA7vSH78IebQ

@realDonaldTrump Mr President, This action is in fact treasonous - Please have your DOJ arrest him immediately - MAGA pic.twitter.com/T6iks2wowD
@realDonaldTrump You will leave office with the WORST presidential record in history. I hope our nation recovers.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You were callous and totally disregarded @SteveScalise with contempt towards rights expressed in the Constitution that you took an oath to uphold @WhiteHouse Shall not be infringed! @NRA
Can someone tell @realDonaldTrump that total capitulation to #demoncraps gun control is not a strong second amendment platform. Just saying.
@parscale Congrats on the new job #Trump2020 Get @realDonaldTrump To get immigration & infant structure bill done ASAP! Get Flint's water problems solved thousand still need pipes fixed & you should start getting testimonials of regular people getting more $ back from the taxbill

Give him credit. @realDonaldTrump said he was going to drain the swamp. Little did we know the swamp was actually everyone that sacrificed their dignity to work for him
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, please don't join the dems and banning assault weapons when it's happened before and it didn't make any difference!
@realDonaldTrump needs a non-DC leader leading DOJ. Rosenstein's running the show.Mueller, Wray & Horowitz report 2 Rosenstein! It's a set up! #DeepState MAGA! #RudyGiuliani
@realDonaldTrump doesn't just spew word salad, he's got diarrhea of the mouth. He has no idea what he's saying. He's irresponsible with his words. I'm really upset by his demands to violate people's rights. Awful.
@realDonaldTrump HOW IN THIS WORLD do you allow AMAZON NOT PAY FEDERAL taxes? This company & owner the richest in the world! This is not MAGA and not fair. Loop holes should not be available to billion dollar companies! WAKE UP people AMAZON is destroying more than businesses.

Yet you and your party support the worst offender, @realDonaldTrump
@FLGovScott @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump 1)Why is this issue of gun control so difficult? Saving the life of a child is a no-brainer. If one life is spared as a result of banning assault weapons it is worth everything. Do you not comprehend how your words and actions are viewed?
If @realDonaldTrump is trying to inspire his base to get out and vote in the midterms, does he really think supporting Gun control is going to do it? We would be looking to vote for those who oppose him on that issue!
@realDonaldTrump You're losing me with this #GunControl thing.

It is so sweet after enduring the whole "Obama will take your guns" for 8 years, that it is @realDonaldTrump that calls for gun confiscation w/o due process. For the Trump voters not up to speed on any amendment but the 2nd, he's going to take your guns for no legal reason. @NRA
Wow, #GunControl is so obvious, even @realDonaldTrump gets it.
Tried to watch the press conference about gun issues & @realDonaldTrump said stronger gun laws would not make him popular but he has never cared about being popular. WHAT! Oh come on, you are BIGLEY in to being popular, biggest crowd, higest rating, you live for it...LOL
@realDonaldTrump ...You seem to be so busy trying to make teachers carry guns. Well, today a TEACHER in Dalton High School brought in his gun and started shooting away!!! So, this is your answer to gun violence? Really? Please resign now!

His eyes wide open! Little Marco admits that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #CadetBoneSpurs habit of tossing around nicknames like Lyin Ted, Crooked Hillary, Ugly Carly, Fake Press, etc. has brought the level of discourse into the gutter. When will @FLOTUS do something about it?
@realDonaldTrump @NRA @WhiteHouse Oh yeah. This is just getting started.
Yes - harboring criminals is a crime and as the ICE director said - 'reckless' decision to alert illegal immigrants of raids @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse

@realDonaldTrump is incapable of speaking on a subject with any clarity. He's demanding that the Congress violate the Constitution, raise age limits arbitrarily, due process after the fact & leaving young women to fend for themselves. He has ZERO credibility about guns. Wow!
You lost Hope. You must not lose hope, though. There is a life after your #MAGA interlude at the @WhiteHouse . Cheer up!

Yes, @realDonaldTrump has said before, and again at CPAC, that arming 10-20% of teachers currently trained is an idea. It's misinformation that he wants to arm all teachers.
@realDonaldTrump Tread carefully Mr. President. I love you but this is left of Obama. We have due process for a reason.

@realDonaldTrump so are you going to continue with your plan to give teachers guns?? , after the Dalton High School in Georgia when a teacher pulled a gun out and barricaded themselves in the class room. Just wondering because you're normally full of such wonderful solutions
@realDonaldTrump Tell me Sir the Circus is in Town in White House these days ?
Obama's PROMISE PROGRAM gave schools $$ money to NOT arrest or charge students? Still in place? @POTUS Obama made sure FL Killer Student Nikolas Cruz had a clean record so background ck let him sail through. @VP @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio

Could it be similar reasons to @realDonaldTrump and @GOP not standing up to the gun lobby? Hmmmm.
@realDonaldTrump if you raise the age to buy guns then raise the age for admission to the military. Also outlaw psychotropic drugs for minors they all were on it.
So today i found out that one of the photographers that I shot with all week shot @realDonaldTrump wedding. Woah
