@marcorubio is not deserving of your respect when he supports a racist white Supremacist like @realdonaldtrump Rubio should watch out. Perhaps he and his family or extended family will be the next ones to be deported by his man Herr Trump.

you had me @TulsiGabbard at your quick response and professionalism in reaction to this response, but then you started blaming @realDonaldTrump which is not pertinent to this circumstance! He is doing something, but you don't agree...

You won because of fake news @realDonaldTrump

Is there a tool to filter out any reference to @realDonaldTrump in my twitter feed? If there is I promise to visit more often
@jamieleecurtis #Obama had 8 years to build safe havens for the people of #Hawaii , which by BTW would take 7 years to accomplish. Yet he did nothing! Pfft, and Hawaii is his stomping grounds. @realDonaldTrump please make it happen for them! #EMERGENCY #TheStormHasArrived #qanon
Damn that porn star only got $130,000 for keeping quiet about @realDonaldTrump ? You got played, girl.
Listen to my opinion @TomiLahren @maddow @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
As someone who lives in @repjohnlewis district. He is more of a role model than @realDonaldTrump or anyone on your network outside of Shep. You need more @ShepNewsTeam and less @seanhannity pic.twitter.com/N0eEssTfBq
@realDonaldTrump people from #shitholecountries built this nation, just saying.
Hey @realDonaldTrump you are only supposed to capitalize the *title* of a book. I know books are really mysterious and confusing for you, but it really isn't that complicated.
@realdonaldtrump also lacks appreciation for the fact that being the leader of the free world is 24/7.
@realDonaldTrump PLEASE ARREST AND CHARGE ALL THESE TRAITORS IN THE MEDIA TRYING TO TURN THE PEOPLE AGAINST YOU SIR!!
Hey, any chance @realDonaldTrump will go to South Korea for the Winter Olympics? And not come back?

He did this too: . @realDonaldTrump cut the corporate tax rate for Koch Ind., Apple & Walmart by 40% and raised co-pays for military Vets on @TRICARE Prime by 67% because he Veterans!
The state of Hawaii is sent into sheer unbridled terror today -- due to our so-called president's policies and shithole mouth -- and *this* is the tweet we get from this narcissistic, self-absorbed excuse for a human being: @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/Lk9A5e9ZuN
And you are RIDICULOUSLY STUPID for accusing @realDonaldTrump for something he did not do. How nice, I used to love watching your movies, now I'm adding you to the #Boycott list. Bye-bye
Dear @realDonaldTrump Our s**thole country is anything but. Perhaps you need to step out of your box and discover the stunning country that is Zimbabwe. If you don't believe me here is just a Snippet of the glory....let us know if you need guidance #wheninZim #donaldtrump pic.twitter.com/fFNbMfZmPD
Don't care who you are, family, friend, or coworker. If you still support @realDonaldTrump , you're a denizen of the shithole and dead to me. Real human beings have more class and intelligence. @jaketapper @RWPUSA @maddow @RalphNortham . No traitors, bigots, or racists in my life.

@realDonaldTrump I would like to take this time to thank you. Thank you for showing people's true, dull, unopenminded colors vs people who want to see change for EVERYONE EQUALLY and positive change!
@realDonaldTrump #RacistTrump Haiti has sacrificed for out country. Friend is in GA now. He adds the following: In 1779, 500 Haitians, mostly former slaves, volunteered to leave Haiti and fight for American Independence. Please tell Trump to shut his shithole. pic.twitter.com/2KkeqbkdrE
YES!!!! Thank you @realDonaldTrump !!!
What do you want to bet that @realDonaldTrump finally acknowledges that @BarackObama was born in Hawaii so he can blame this on him. Or, blame it on @HillaryClinton because Hillary and Hawaii both begin with an H. #TheResistance #ImpeachTrump #Hawaii @GOP @DNC
@realDonaldTrump Barack Obama will always be a better President, father and husband than you. Obama will always be better than you in every way.

@realDonaldTrump As a social science researcher, I have to agree with the need for accurate information. Too much research addressing lower SES & economic strife points to one minority group or another. This causes confusion & development of bad policies & programs. Voodoo scien.
Really? How low will you go to stay with unstable, psychopath, certified racist, liar, conman @realDonaldTrump ? Monster Trump has his state TV puppets from @FoxNews , who're LYING and telling him what to say!
@realDonaldTrump BREAKING NEWS: Orange troll to campaign for Obama's 3rd term!

@realDonaldTrump I am asking for your help. I work for Health and Wellness center of Louisa. We need the health care bill passed to support our facility. The patients that come to us have no insurance or away of obtaining it. We provide excellent health care. #MakeAmericaGreat
@realDonaldTrump You dirty, disgusting troll; the goblins have returned and we won't put up with you or your shithole attitude. Good day sir.
You are being used. @realDonaldTrump thinks no more of you than he does about the Haitians and Africans that he so reflexively disparages. You claim he cares about Americans, yet he hires foreign workers, makes his products overseas, builds with Chinese steel, and cheats vendors.
Well, I'm counting the days. @realDonaldTrump seems to have ramped it up since you've been off air!
And yet, despite the possibility of it being any number of shithole countries, @realDonaldTrump hasn't yet authorized ANY kind of government cybersecurity initiative to protect us from this ACTUAL threat. I guess he thinks his wall would do that, too.
@realDonaldTrump America needs a President who does create division on a daily basis. The News Media is not creating drama you are.
Ironic we hear @realDonaldTrump talk about "sh*thole countries" when he's got a sh*thole mouth!

@SenSanders @CNN @MMFlint @SenWarren What @realDonaldTrump and GOP cronies fail to appreciate, is that countries with merit-based immigration are looking for people who fit the needs of the country, regardless of country or color of their skin.

People living in #Detroit should put up the #shithole videos to get these #Democrats kicked out in the next election @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump dear Donny. When the #nuclear warning in #hawaii was sounded, didn't u get an advisory from ANY of your staff? Aren't u supposed to? Would it have hurt to let the #stateofHawaii know it was a false alarm and u were aware? #golfmuch ?
Look, Ladies and Gentlemen, a snowflake! @moasaad1 blocked me because I explained to him, in a previous post, the TRUTH about how the BBC is funded and he didn't like it, because he's an arsehole and he believes EVERY word @realDonaldTrump and @Nigel_Farage tells him. Get a life! pic.twitter.com/vx0UjtdAtF
I agree. @realDonaldTrump is an #IllegitimatePresident
What happened today in #Hawaii was in no way @realDonaldTrump fault as #Liberals , #LiberalHollywood , & the #FakeNews media will tell you. Said he is taking too long. Trump has wanted to bomb #NorthKorea since his Fire and Fury comments in August. Media crucifies him.
@realDonaldTrump Your hate and racism is affecting the world. Mayor of London dealing with ignorant racists like you

@LGrantz3 @JimEAllen2 @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump President Trump The American People back you 100%. If you were not effective the Dems & lapdog media would not be freaking out. Keep Making America Great!
Had this false alert in Hawaii happened 2 yrs ago we would have been asking if the system was hacked instead of panicking. I blame @realDonaldTrump @POTUS . Are we great enough yet?!

@realDonaldTrump Dunno if you heard, but Hawaii is an island surrounded by waters...LOTS of water.....maybe you can arrange a summit meeting with the President of Hawaii to discuss things...
Please talk about an orther country like France Thank you I am so sad. @realDonaldTrump
Just add Hillary and Investigation in the same sentience. You guys have to get over your fantasy of seeing Hilary in stripes. #FreakyFetish Meanwhile, IN THE REAL WORLD, Mueller continues to get closer and closer to @realDonaldTrump #Indictments . http:// NeedToImpeach.com

#iranprotests I seen video where the Iranian government is publicly hanging protestors and the #liberals say nothing but if @realDonaldTrump supposedly says SH*T hole, then that is the BIG DEAL for @CNN !
At this point, does anyone else think we'd be better off with no President at all than with @realDonaldTrump ?
If he is your president, than you can keep him. The same people want someone else. And, how can you claim to love god and be a @realDonaldTrump supporter. The two are mutually exclusive!
@realDonaldTrump Father was at KKK meeting 1927 and trump also associated ? Seems the KLKK Rubs off on President who never told anyone He is German based by father & family Line although mother was Scottish ?
@realDonaldTrump has done somethin right! He has shown what a Racist &ugly racism looks like so that every1 can c racism's ugly face. When u c ppl fm other races comdemin him 4his vile &racist remarks then u NO th country is united n its stand against divisiveness hatred &racism.
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @foxandfriends @washingtonpost Please ,continue to act like the Dumbass that 4/5 of the USA and the rest of the WORLD knows you truly are! The more stupid dumbshit you say and do, the quicker we will be done with the Idiot-In-Chief, known as "The Dump"!
Any word on the missile threat in Hawaii? No? @realDonaldTrump
Stormy day in Twitter and for @realDonaldTrump
Inaction is the wrong action. It's time for a different strategy, as @realDonaldTrump stated.
What if WE ALL BLOCKED @realDonaldTrump ?!?! It would be so great to see him responding to MOST of the #FREEWORLD blocking him?!?! Who's with me?!?! #blocked #ResistanceUnited #blockchain #AMJoy #stablegenius #PoS #INSTABLOCK #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #ShutUpTrump #FBRParty #FBR
We have to take #FireAndFury w/ healthy skepticism but it's revealing that @MichaelWolffNYC said to @donlemon on CNN that @realDonaldTrump constantly repeats himself. Trump says the book is fake & yet he tweets almost the exact same rant an hour apart. Truth always finds its way pic.twitter.com/Ml0ITJoOAR
But in this case it is being led by another self proclaimed genius (following in hitlers footsteps) @realDonaldTrump "tiny" our fake president...
#LeakerSaysWhat ? @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec
@SenSasse Do you mock the disabled? Think @SenatorJohnMcCain isn't a hero because he was captured? Haiti, El Salvador, & African nations are shitholes? There are some very fine people among white supremacists? Stand with @realDonaldTrump ? Have you no decency? #NeedtoImpeach
@realDonaldTrump @VP @Douglas_Collins 1 week from 1 year...Thank you Mr President, I can feel our country making progress & gaining respect. Keep tweeting for the media garners no trust. Keep speaking the truth they try to silence or twist. God bless you
& when @realDonaldTrump makes a statement, will you be mad at the governor of HI? Because that's who you should be mad at in the first place
@realDonaldTrump you sir are the one who is deranged!
@realDonaldTrump Anybody else with me on these sentiments? pic.twitter.com/QhWmJqcpI4
Nice to know that @realDonaldTrump is focused on Fake News and Fake Book themes still. Would have loved to have him here with us in Hawaii this AM! And feel the damn fear we felt... so that maybe he would take his flippant "button" comments to heart!
Truth has no meaning to @realDonaldTrump and his cult.
Come on @realDonaldTrump , stop messin' around with the national alert system. You're scaring people.
Reagan, Bush, Clinton, W., and Obama would have been on the tv hours ago reassuring the American people that all was okay. Instead, this shitgibbon @realDonaldTrump is at his golf course tweeting about a book that hurt his feelings and an election he never wanted to win.
