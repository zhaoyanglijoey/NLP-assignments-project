Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. McCabe and all the women and men of the FBI for working to keep our country safe. The coordinated attacks on law enforcement by Congressional Republicans & @realDonaldTrump are wrong and must stop. STOP THE TRUMP TREASON!

Hey! Has @realDonaldTrump tweeted any hate tweets today?? Wonder why?
Mueller should be interviewing @DevinNunes as it appears he is a willing and able accomplice of #shitholepresident @realDonaldTrump
Why in other countries do they stage coups? This is why! Justice system is corrupt. Schiff was not so concerned starting an investigation on a rumor. Here there is written proof. Mueller has something to do with this also. Wray's afraid of him. @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes
Was I the only one disgusted by the emotional pandering on display during the #SOTU ? Was I the only one disgusted by @realDonaldTrump using the suffering of parents and individuals for his own advantage?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President; No more secrets. We, the people, demand the truth at whatever cost. Please, release the memo. Signed, a real American citizen, NOT a Russian bot. #releasethememo #release the memo
Because the democrats are open to dialogue from a variety of people and view points unlike the #GOP who are in lock step with @realDonaldTrump and his #trumpcrimefamily
@realDonaldTrump is also not all there
Hey @DevinNunes ! Loyalty is a one way street with @realDonaldTrump ! Have you lawyered up yet?

I mostly liked @realDonaldTrump speech. However, on the section of the #SOTU about the war on drugs and foreign policy I couldn't help but remember @ThomasEWoods brilliant Law: "No matter which candidate you vote for, you always wind up with John McCain"
Of course the FBI & DOJ are against it. Those accused of wrongdoing don't want evidence or truth released. @realDonaldTrump #ReleaseTheMemo

Why does @realDonaldTrump get so much credit for *acting presidential*? Since when has any president been given this *free pass*? What if I'd have gone to the hospital in my nurse role-and didn't act *nurse-like?* It wld only happen once, b4 being told "bye, Felicia"
@realDonaldTrump do you understand what Obstruction of Justice is? What the elements of the criminal act are? You may not care because you think Pence will pardon you to get your job. But what if he doesn't or won't?
