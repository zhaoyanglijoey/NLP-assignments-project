Trump is a loser and this unprecedented turnover proves it! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DHSgov use the El Chapo billions to build the wall!!!! Where is the $$$$. Use it Mr President
@JoeBiden would crush @realDonaldTrump
The rejection of Obama's failures & a @realDonaldTrump Win could only mean one thing, he cheated, we'll at least that's what they cling too now. They insist ALL Americans loved Obama & the #MSM made sure to aid that delusion yet votes painted a far different reality.
who's fatter, @realDonaldTrump or Jones?

Why would you allow this bill to pass. Do the right thing and VETO. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@VP , @realDonaldTrump , Sir , you are a class act and a great vice President.
@realDonaldTrump If you really want to make a splash when you appear before Mueller, begin with "You had NO crime, NO proof,, you've wasted millions of taxpayer dollars, and I will not let you waste one more dime. You're FIRED!"
. @realDonaldTrump #RESIGN . RESIGN NOW.
@realDonaldTrump you really need to VETO this hot mess. Virtually no wall, and pretty much all the fluff that Chuck and Nancy could want. Sign this and THEY WIN!!! If it means a shutdown, then shut it down. This bill is NOT #MAGA @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr SOLD OUT!
@realDonaldTrump @VP @POTUS is Pence going to be fired next? Or should we impeach the supreme court justices. Get your stuff together. @CNN

How can @realDonaldTrump be for this omnibus bill when it funds sanctuary cities or states like California? I thought he was opposed to sanctuary status because they make American's less safe. I'm confused.
It all makes @realDonaldTrump look incredibly week. It is like Congress is trying to humiliate him...his pro-Omnibus comments make him look even weaker.
Dear me, the World is screwed. @realDonaldTrump , unleashed and dangerous. To be fair @realDonaldTrump has always been unscrewed.

@realDonaldTrump is an utterly shameful excuse for a president. It is beyond comprehension to imagine how someone so utterly bereft of all character can be President of the most powerful nation on Earth. Who are we #americans for voting him in? What is OUR character?

The best idea for today is that everyone should just ask @realDonaldTrump to resign and end the drama of investigations, nuclear war, trade wars, etc. if you agree, RETWEET. It may convince him to do it.

Consider: @realDonaldTrump is a temp worker; only in office a finite amount of time. He isn't a king or emperor, despite his best attempts to act like one. HE'S AN EMPLOYEE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Working in his administration would mean YOU work for the American people. Got it?
FYI @realDonaldTrump the world now knows Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian operative who hacked into the DNC to give @wikileaks documents. Wait why am I telling you this? You already knew that.
You're dangerous moron @realDonaldTrump puppet! Do you realize that he's firing BRAVES PATRIOTS who dare to STAND UP TO HIS BOSS MURDERER PUTIN? He fired Rex Tillaerson, now McMaster because of it, who's next @nikkihaley ?

@realDonaldTrump approval was at 38% before election day, and he won 46% of the popular vote. Trump now has 42% approval. That means he would get around 50% of popular vote today. No science behind this, just an observation.
