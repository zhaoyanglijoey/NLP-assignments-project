You know speaking of respect owed #JohnMcCain is owed an apology by @realDonaldTrump ; people have written off Don saying that McCain is not a hero because he was captured, I for one have not. We are honoring the long ago dead, I hope it brings some comfort to those left behind.

Mr Trump wouldn't be president if it wasn't for WikiLeaks and Julian. Would cement him as the greatest president in my lifetime if he gave Assange asylum & pardoned him. C'mon @realDonaldTrump do the right thing.

@realDonaldTrump Even if only these Korean War Vets we get I hope we get them all buy this should be all over our TV period they gave so much they deserve to have this moment for everyone to see.
I think the silly season is likely to reach the point of absurdity, given @realDonaldTrump 's recently-trending BS output.
When asked, @CNN executives refused to explain their shocking & shameful decision, refusing to cover the emotional return home of soldiers killed in the Korean War. @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @brianstelter @ChrisCuomo @CillizzaCNN @seanhannity @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson
@realDonaldTrump if elected Mr. President, I will push to see this ridiculous waste of tax payer money witch hunt conspiracy theory of the democrats so called Russia investigation brought to an end. Then the Democrat party will pay the people of the United States back every $!!!
@realDonaldTrump Regardless of what the fake news organizations are reporting, the educated American knows you are doing your best to put America first and make this a great country again but Democrats are against you on everything. I supported you and I will support you again

Our president @realDonaldTrump can take care of himself pretty well but all this noise has to be hard on #FLOTUS . Admire her poise in the face of the madness.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump there is an Einstein quote about doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results is insanity. Trump constantly lies and deflects and somehow expects sane Americans to believe him. Not going to happen Donnie boy.
There is no crime of "collusion" for you @realDonaldTrump in the same way, if I jumped into a pool naked, I couldn't be arrested for "skinny dipping": it isn't the correct word(s) for the crime, but the import is the same as the charge would be.

@realDonaldTrump clearly committed obstruction and he knows it. Which is why @PressSec lied for him.
With the help of @CLewandowski_ @Scavino45 @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @FLOTUS @GenFlynn and a small cast of others, he decided to make a real race of it. One thing you do not do is tell @realDonaldTrump that he can't do something. He will prove you wrong every time.
@realDonaldTrump is a stone-cold racist. He's proven this in deeds and words and many, many times. His father was even arrested at a Klan rally. Trump engaged in housing discrimination, went after innocent black men, and birthed the birther nonsense. He & his cultists are racists
So in conclusion let it be known now that our great president @realDonaldTrump does not support #qanon as implied by @PressSec . #TrustTRUMP #StableGenius

@realDonaldTrump resign now. It's the only way to save face
They HAVE to. Trump is a one man wrecking ball. Nobody, particularly conservatives want to be on the wrong side of that Potus Twitter. Particularly when 90% of conservatives SUPPORT @realdonaldtrump

Rudy Giuliani says (repeating @realDonaldTrump ) that collusion is not a crime. Collusion is a conspiracy, and conspiracy against our democratic elections -- or laws our country has in place -- is definitely a crime! Saying there was no collusion is just word salad, in the end.

So, just so you understand what's happening here... 1. @realDonaldTrump being the ignorant moron that be is, launched HIS #TarriffTantrum against our closest Allies 2. Our Allies, of course, retaliated against Trump's absurd #Tarriffs 1/3
So @realDonaldTrump aka @POTUS now officially admits that #TrumpConspired ! #ImpeachTrumpNow
maybe you should quit your day job and consider being a comedian @realDonaldTrump
May be @realDonaldTrump should start telling #trimpsupporters what part of the news is fake. To b specific. When networks make mistakes they correct them publicly. Trump won't say b/c he knows Networks are correct otherwise he could sue them for libel.

@realDonaldTrump PRESIDENT Obama gets MILLIONS more likes than you Orange Dotard.
@realDonaldTrump says the "Fake News" is the "enemy of the people". At last night's rally he gestured to the reporters in the room and referred to them as "Fake News". This is, at a pure minimum, reckless endangerment of another person. A crime. Another crime. #NotMyPresident
Regarding @realDonaldTrump maybe @VanJones68 @AprilDRyan we should simply respect the fact! HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES the most powerful leader in the world of course he is persuasive negative or positive
Ummm, @realDonaldTrump does NOT pray. He believes only in himself.
Oh no! No one at WF or Publix or TJ has ever asked me for my ID. Have they been breaking the law all this time @realDonaldTrump ? Besides being a tremendous liar, you are a f%*king #moron . And @PressSec , your response was that he was referring to alcohol, was just pitiful.
Given that Judge Roberts is a Strict Constructionist, I don't believe that can happen. Then again, I never thought that @realDonaldTrump would win either. You never know... Maybe Putin has something on Judge Roberts too, and all bets are off.

Appreciated the candor shown, and genuine alarm conveyed, by Christopher Wray, Dan Coates and Kirstjen Nielsen today about Russian meddling. Wish @realDonaldTrump had the cojones to do the same.
That's cute, @realDonaldTrump , JR I don't think you know much about the Third Reich or Hitler, but if you did, you'd recognize a great deal of their tactics and methodology being employed by your fascist father and the crooked @GOP .
Yes, Jim @Acosta , the efforts of @CNN #FakeNews to damage and remove a duly elected @realDonaldTrump from office and to obstruct his popular campaign platform makes you an #EnemyOfThePeople

Likelihood of @realDonaldTrump sniping at Obama when he notices all the love for his predecessor on #ObamaDay ? High. Extremely high.
@realDonaldTrump our duly elected @POTUS is correct calling out #FakeNews , not entire Press, just propoganda media daily not reporting good happening in by Administration & on top of it - bash Trump supporters. Reap what you sow . We should stop referring to them as MSM
. @realDonaldTrump says he only endorses people with the "best test scores." Meanwhile, Balderson holds himself out as an Ohio State grad, when he never was. #OH12

They might indeed compare @realDonaldTrump to Honest Abe, but it's certainly not going to be a favorable comparison! #TrumpRussia . wishing you a very happy #ObamaDay !
@realDonaldTrump when you started talked about the great Warton School..my volume went down on my laptop. When you stopped, it went louder....
So we should keep paying Russia tens of millions per astronaut, per ride (and be beholden to them for our space security as well) for using their RD-180s versus going to the private sector like ULA, SpaceEx, BlueOrigin?? @realDonaldTrump is doing a great job! Space Force! MAGA
Why are @CNN and @MSNBC not covering the @realDonaldTrump rally?
Why does the media still cover these @GOP rallies? They are giving @realDonaldTrump FREE advertising & a platform to spew his lies, hate filled speech, & abuse toward the media. #TrumpLies #TrumpConspired #TrumpRussia

Um, @realDonaldTrump disagrees and he said so via Twitter this morning.
I don't know why said "clowns" on the left need to down play anything, at least until @realDonaldTrump replaces the AG and the Director of the FBI. Just my thoughts on the matter.
Send Chicago the help they need @realDonaldTrump "Chicago is NOT a Trump Free Zone" they're begging for help
Soooo. I hear the big meanies at a @realDonaldTrump rally were taking selfies with #JimAcosta and he was happy to smile for the pictures. On the flip side, #JakeTapper advised @DLoesch that he hoped she had security and needed to leave the #CNN town hall immediately ...
@realDonaldTrump you're an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump you admitted your son purjured himself... In a public tweet... You are the reason your kid is going to go to jail... Keep tweeting!

@realDonaldTrump you can hold rallies where you give out bile. I know the caliber of the people at those rallies. They want a country that GIVES them a gold goose. They are the ones who disregarded the warning signs of problems within the companies they worked for.
@RealDonaldTrump Stop whining!!
While, @KingJames is entitled to his opinion and I respect that he is unafraid to express. It was Lebron who attacked @realDonaldTrump first. Our President was defending himself. Lets call a spade a spade.
