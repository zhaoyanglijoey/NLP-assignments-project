@realDonaldTrump but you might have the misguided premise that you are putting America first by deporting true Honorable Americans with the added safety net that there would be 800 thousands plus now without the ability to challenge your corrupt agenda
. @realDonaldTrump has proven to be an unreliable negotiating partner, even going back on his word with members of his own party.
@realDonaldTrump Do you limbo. How low can you go.
You mean #Resist ? @realDonaldTrump #ReleaseTheMemo
Also first time I've heard any democrat talk about the opioid crisis. Looks like they are stealing parts of @realDonaldTrump agenda. Best way to stop drugs entering out country is build a wall @chuckschumer #SchumerSellout

@realDonaldTrump So, President Bannon was fired and has now been REPLACED with @StephenMillerAL Once again YOU have someone in your WH who seemingly has more power than you do He's playing you like a cheap violin & you look weak & stupid CONGRATS PRESIDENT MILLER you own @POTUS

Mr. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump the way bills go through the House and Senate need to change. Each bill should address ONE issue only. That way there would be no bickering when one party wants one issue one way and the other party wants another issue another way!
You know the march was PROTESTING @realDonaldTrump realand his sick agenda! You don't report news, you report what trumpty dumpty pays you to report.
@realDonaldTrump is a despicable little fuck faced, umpaloompa. He gave paramedics the right to refuse to treat someone that is LGBT.

Do you trust @realDonaldTrump ?
How long before we see @realDonaldTrump taking some sort of credit for ending the #trumpshutdown ?
There is no possible way @realDonaldTrump would support this. #DumpDACA

@realDonaldTrump Mr. Presiden END CHAIN AND LOTTERY MIGRATION. NO MORE UNDERAGE MIGRATION. Send them back home.FULL FUNDING FOR THE BORDER WALL, More Guards, More equipment, Better pay. NO MORE SANCTUARY CITIES. MERIT MIGRATION and require time limits to file for citizenship.
Memo was smokescreen to divert attention from #TrumpShutdown . Emails! Memo! Texts! All diversions from the incompetent governing of @realDonaldTrump and @GOP .
It has been shown that @spkerofthehouse @SenateMajLdr and definitely @realDonaldTrump cannot be trusted Would you want to be torn away from your family and the only country you've known There has to be a solution to #Dreamers and their families not deportation Good vote!

And this is who everybody wanted over @realDonaldTrump people that support imported gang members of #MS -13 to come rape our women & children. SMH at you #Dems

@realDonaldTrump We appreciate the sacrifices that you and your family are making to restore America to God. We know that a vocal few do not appreciate what you do; but what really matters is that you are doing what God wants you to do.
The best #immigration deal for the @TheDemocrats to accept is no deal at all. By not reaching a deal @realDonaldTrump doesn't get his wall, more funds for #BorderSecurity , and the elimination of #ChainMigration and the #VisaLottery .

@realDonaldTrump has been exposed, and what's under the wig isn't a pretty sight.
Stephen Miller has the speech writing skills of an angry third grader and knows @realDonaldTrump struggles to read speeches out loud in public. The result is policy based on a limited vocabulary with no grounding in scientific research or critical thought.

Putting the people first: 1) POTUS is responsible for gov't shutdowns. @realDonaldTrump said so in 2013. 2) Tax cuts going away in 2yrs while the cuts to corporations and the wealthy are permanent. 3) Parts of Puerto Rico are still without power and water. #Resist #ImpeachTrump

Never ever in this history of the presidency where so many top admin officials have been questioned or indicted. This is bad for u @realDonaldTrump ! Mueller seeks to question Trump about Flynn and Comey departures http:// wapo.st/2n5EOKD
@realDonaldTrump The good news is Mueller wanting to interview you indicates he is coming to the end of his Obstruction Investigation. The bad news is he is moving past the conspiracy as he already has what he needs and he will focus on your families bank fraud/money laundering!
@realDonaldTrump no questioning
Well, pressure is on @LovesTrump4ever , as this question is going to get harder and harder as Mueller tightens the noose. So, Jeanie, while Trumps indictment is still sealed, why don't you enlighten us as to why you love @realDonaldTrump so much?

We can all agree @realDonaldTrump is an complete racist idiot... So why do people keep expecting him to say something profound when tragedy strikes again that involves white people? "When you're white it's alright."- @chrisrock

@realDonaldTrump , Dearest Donald, I'm thrilled that you are looking forward to the Mueller interview. I promise that We the People are looking forward to it too. Imagine how relieved all of us will be when this disaster of a Presidency is finally over. #Trump

@realDonaldTrump releases immigration plans. Check, your move #Cryingchuck .
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump sorry I support you but 1.8 million is too many. DACA was supposed to just be the kids not their parents who came here as adults illegally. Only DACA kids and #EndChainMigration #EndVisaLottery use #EVerify and #BuildTheWall
It's becoming less shiny by the day, lately. Thanks @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP . #PutinsPuppets
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President Trump. Heard about you so called deal to give 1.8million illegals a pathway to citizenship! Once again an immigrant who came the right way, this is not right! DACA parents broke the law. Please stand firm.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. Pres, plz have Obama iinvestigate who interrupted Chicago election with Rahm Emmanuel who lost the election by 1%-Obama had stated for revote, then Rahm Emmanuel won.., totaly illegal. Rahm is Obamas Puppet.

. @realDonaldTrump @NASA Why do you never write your own adult posts? All the posts that have you showing human emotions about others, sympathy, altruism or a humble demeanor are written by your surrogates. You can't even tweet as an adult.
. @realDonaldTrump sounds like you're already backtracking on your willingness to speak with #RobertMueller . None of us are surprised. Truth isn't exactly your strong suit. Integrity either. That's why you're in this mess.

Including the man recently sent back to Mexico after 30 years in the US whom millions of us witnessed in tears at departure at the airport Please relent @realDonaldTrump #reunitethatfamily
$400M a year is nothing of substance? @realDonaldTrump should really take it away
@realDonaldTrump I'm still confused. I thought you said Mexico was paying for the wall?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP NO DACA!!!! WE DON'T WANT 1.8M Illegals here, we want them OUT. #Americansbeforeillegals
the best part is he owns both @realDonaldTrump and @DonaldTrump and sticks with the "real"
@realDonaldTrump Funny how quickly they found these text from Peter and Paige when the American People start yelling for a Special Council to investigate.
@realDonaldTrump So let me get it straight. If a cop is pointing a gun at me because I punched him, and then I shoot him. Is that "Fighting Back"? I know that sounds extreme, but firing Comey was extreme as well.
@realDonaldTrump never cared about players kneeling. He just wanted to find something to go after the NFL for to assist his buddy Vince in his latest venture. I'm sure Trump will get his piece if it comes to fruition, he does NOTHING for free.
... @realDonaldTrump knows what he is doing. I trust his decision 100%
Is anybody in here a member of the "secret society" formed within the FBI that's going to take down Trump, according to GOP hacks? If so, please add me to the society. LMAO @realDonaldTrump @rushlimbaugh @FoxNews pic.twitter.com/lBZYjAcBsP
@GOPChairwoman You constantly send me emails for money. I cant give you anymore since @realDonaldTrump has decided that amnesty Now is more imp than The Wall &other changes to chain&visa. We voted for a Wall not for Dreamers to become citizens. How abt Trump base wins this one??
Trump wants a wall and he will get a wall. The reason we have the illegals is because we have no wall! Build the wall @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump how is legalizing 1.8 million New Democrat voters good for Americans? How? Not #MAGA
Do not cave and give @realDonaldTrump any money for a worthless wall. Need better border security through hiring more border patrol and newer technology. #nowall pic.twitter.com/FHdYxCD3Bs
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I think the 880,000. dreamers should become legal now, and there should be a path to citizenship for them within 10 to 12 years if we get the wall, an end to chain migration, and an end to the immigration lottery.
so much for testifying under a oath @realDonaldTrump . After all who is in control ?
Right, because that's the only way women should react when their husband/partner cheats on them @FLOTUS is smarter than @realDonaldTrump .... she's probably cleaning out her belongings and heading back to the #NYC golden penthouse (Possession is 9/10th of law)
@realDonaldTrump please Mr. President. No Amnesty.
. @realDonaldTrump - #QAnon News today from #FakeNews @CNN & others is that "secret society" was just a "joke"... I wonder how they will laugh when all their "secret" emails between @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton surface? Methinks the "joke" is on them ;) #ReleaseTheMemo

The White House's new immigration framework is as extreme and anti-immigrant as its creators Steven Miller and . @realdonaldtrump . This plan, which proposes cuts to legal and family immigration, unnecessary border enforcement funds & more in exchange for #DACA protections is DOA.

@realDonaldTrump How about we send all the DACA and Dreamer people home for a few years and let them apply for entry legally. My mom's side of the family immigrated legally, why can't they?
"Anchor baby" refers to people born to parents who aren't citizens....Pretty sure @realDonaldTrump is. When it comes to "chain migration", welcome to the blessings of doing things right and under the law. Your whole argument is amature at best.
@realDonaldTrump #DonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @OfficeGovEthics @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats Its all over how "low-budget" and "tacky" the Mar-a-Lago gala was last week. $100K got you caviar with plastic spoons? But more $ in your pockets right?
Come on, @jrpsaki , @realDonaldTrump was pro #2A and @NRA before he ran. Do you also believe that #Putin used the #NRA to get to #Trump ? LOL. I'm sure NRA would've supported @HillaryClinton for POTUS if it weren't for #Russia "hacking" the NRA, right?
I hope @realDonaldTrump & @jeffsessions read this tweet. @JohnKerry thinks he calls shots?! He probably also thought @HillaryClinton was going 2 B president. So what does that tell U ?!
I don't think so, @realDonaldTrump is a gentleman compatmre to the @NicolasMaduro "The butcher" God bless America and Venezuela
Let's be honest. @realDonaldTrump doesn't propose anything. He does colouring in and watches Bob the Wall Builder while adults make the proposals and he just takes credit for it.
Dear @realDonaldTrump , The greatest lesson in life is to know that even fools are right sometimes.
Bad move on the part of @realDonaldTrump . His supporters did not vote for this, they wanted to #BuildTheWall

@realDonaldTrump Your immigration proposal is VERY VERY BAD. This is NOT putting Americans first. We voted for you because you promised just the opposite...that there would be no amnesty and all illegals must go back. I will demand that my representative oppose this. disappointed

Like everything else.... @realDonaldTrump doesn't actually know what that actually means. Taken in the context of what being a feminist is, he is stating he think MEN should be the superior gender and women are inferior. So basically....what we all knew about the creep already
Saying nothing and doing nothing is even worse, just what Obama did, grow up and quit throwing stones, if your boy Obama done what @realDonaldTrump did you would praise him, just because it was a Trump idea you try to crucify him

How about deciding on a design, figure out how much wall is needed, get a bid, then make a request for what is needed from Mexico whom he promised would pay for it. @realDonaldTrump is only keeping 1/2 his promise, that's failure.
Isn't @realDonaldTrump a 2nd generation immigrant via his mother?

@realDonaldTrump If our economy is so great and businesses are coming back to the U.S. in droves why are your businesses still over seas? Do you ever plan to come back? I don't think you'll ever bring your businesses back to the states. Classic hypocrite!

1.)What people don't know is that Obama decompartmentalized the PDB Presidential Daily Briefing so that even people in the IRS were able to unmask private citizens! Every Dept. FBI, CIA, DHS etc. Briefs @realDonaldTrump individually every day.
Jesus, people pay you for this shit? (Interesting colour choice for Twitter - brown) Would you be God then? God told all those gullible people to send you money, didn't he? How's the new plane? Did it cost more or less than @realDonaldTrump 's Air Force One refrigerators?
At this point if the orange ass clown . @realdonaldtrump doesn't shit himself during the SOTU the media will proclaim him "presidential "

@realDonaldTrump Why don't you go kiss your buddy Putin's ass and get the fuck out of this country.

PLEEZE @realDonaldTrump set those "no protest" conditions for return to U.S. Move to Russia with your Traitorous buds.
Exactly. It's the same reason why they won't do anything about Donnies threats to the world. He has solely revived a dying social media platform. I wouldn't be shocked if @Twitter paid @realDonaldTrump to exclusively speak his dumb ramblings here to increase their stock $$.
Lol we have a @realDonaldTrump @POTUS president that enjoys getting leaked on. #peegate #russianhookers

@HillaryClinton since you knowingly laid in bed, plotting the coverup during the battle, in which soldiers died and a US ambassador burned to death, how are you not charged with/imprisoned for dereliction of duty? They used to call that #treason . @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump
Oh man, @realDonaldTrump , I think it's hilarious that you somehow think you're the one responsible for the current positive economic climate. If anything, growth is starting to stagnate and you're leaving the common man in the dust while ignoring and not undestanding science.
#JayZ is #CriminalTrash ! And definitely not worth @POTUS @realDonaldTrump time! His response to those questions were beyond STUPID! Only the #ExtremeIgnorant complain when things are getting better for their race! #BlackAndSaidThat

@realDonaldTrump please bring ice agents at the #SOTU2018 , why should we harbor them? Why are we paying for them when some veterans are homeless?
Tomorrow is the deadline for @realDonaldTrump to #ImplementTheSanctions he reluctantly signed. But, as he's Putin's bitch, my guess is he won't do it. Disgraceful.
Yes @realDonaldTrump has krazy karma skills...like a ninja
