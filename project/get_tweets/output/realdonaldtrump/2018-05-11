Kim Jong Un estimated net worth $7-10 Bn. @realDonaldTrump net worth $3.1Bn. Ouch! Jealous? #PoorDonald #Trump #KimIsRicherThanDonald #TrumpIsACunt
@CNN What DT sb embarrassed about is the billing and name calling. Seriously, that's the POTUS. He's suppose to be someone you can respect, admire, trust. @realDonaldTrump isn't any of those things. He's a whiney thin skinned brat You can bet he's not respected by other leaders
@realDonaldTrump TIME HAS COME TO END DOJ/FBI STONEWALLING THE PRESIDENT/CONGRESS AND AMERICAN PEOPLE! ONLY U CAN STOP THEM AND THE LATEST IS THAT DOJ TOLD NUNES/GOWDY THAT THEY HAD A SPY FROM FBI IN TRUMP CAMPAIGN!
Is @realDonaldTrump running @FOXTV ? They're firing everybody.
The AT&T - TIME WARNER merger is bad news @realDonaldTrump you think we have a problem with #FakeNews now? Just wait, we will not have access to TRUTH Media groups are too big now. We're heading to a monopoly on news and internet services And so it begins....

@realDonaldTrump I thought you would help people. I regret ever voting for you. I know you won't even reply. You don't care
@realDonaldTrump postures that he's so brave he'd run into a school where there are semi-automatic gun shots, but he's too much a coward to let anyone in his administration apologize for his staff smearing a tortured American hero who is also a sitting senator and on his deathbed
@realDonaldTrump POTUS will you please pardon Julian Assange... Thank you
God bless ISRAEL and the USA! Thank you for leadership @realDonaldTrump
Apparently, the @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse only knows white people. #RacistPigs
@realDonaldTrump lol Someone has tooo much free time on their hands.
Trump ought to get his facts straight. The military received payrises each year in the last ten years and under Obama an approx 3.9% pay rise compared to approx 2.4% pay rise presently. People of the rust belt are still suffering & homeless haven't been housed. @realDonaldTrump
. @realDonaldTrump is an incredibly ugly piece of sh*t. Both inside and out. #DumpTrump #IdiotInChief #ResignTrump
I think it is extremely disrespectful for a US Senator to tell the President of the United States @realDonaldTrump that he is not welcome at his funeral.
#WINNING !! ... BY THE HOUR #MAGA Thank You Honorable PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/LOpNtnqfjt

Mr. Brody and @realDonaldTrump must be practicing with the same @quizlet live set...
@GOP - list George Soros a traitor to America. He has been trying to do damage to America & @realDonaldTrump .
@kellysadler45 You are a sad and pathetic bitch, and all to representative of the current mental state of @realDonaldTrump and his staff. This White House is an abomination and embarrassment to all decent people of our country. John McCain has more dignity than all of you!
Read @TheJuanWilliams two sons are conservatives. They know their father is FOS #Truth @realDonaldTrump
. @TGowdySC Your country could use a new #AttorneyGeneral . The disaster leadership of the @TheJusticeDept and @FBI really needs to be fixed in order to finally restore confidence in our Judicial system. We have been kept in the dark which is making things worse. @realDonaldTrump
Good! The more time to dedicate to exposing @realDonaldTrump for the lying sac he really is!
Tragic. @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/AlgFC7Wb89
If @realDonaldTrump truly cares about veterans, then it should be relatively simple to fire Sadler and acknowledge the sacrifice @SenJohnMcCain made for his country.
PS I sworn my oaths so I can tell McCain and his daughter to $&@$ OFF! @SenJohnMcCain @AriFleischer @realDonaldTrump @MeghanMcCain
Support American Hero John McCain and vote NO for Trump Administration in 2020.. @cnn @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @JoeBiden #Heroes #NeverAgain #NeverTrump #VETS #VeteransAgainstTrump pic.twitter.com/K8BWqAo27h
@realDonaldTrump You are destroying America for the poor working people
@realDonaldTrump It has happened I knew Paul Cutthroat Ryan was a John McCain look alike or act alike they are whats wrong with the Republican Party they stink also maybe you should Run as an Independent we need you not democrats or Republicans
I wonder how the women, who were paraded by @realDonaldTrump during the campaign, feel now about their president. After finding out that he cheated on Melania with other women + with lawsuits looming from those whom he allegedly abused and harassed, do they feel the same way now?
all those people who foolishly voted for #TraitorTrump and believed the #TaxScamBill would help them maybe- just maybe will realize @realDonaldTrump & @GOP lied to them- #SorryNotSorry #YouOwnHim #ItWillOnlyGetWorse
@realDonaldTrump HELP OUR NURSES!-New Gov. Regs.=hr.'s of after work paperwork! Many R.N.'s quitting/frustrated, because more time w/ Gov. forms than taking care of patient's! My family owes a debt 2 these hard working women/men that can never be repaid! PLEASE HELP THEM/CUTforms
Again, Joe - it is about time someone "fights" for the US Citizens - it may not be pretty - but, what has been happening for years is very ugly! We need @realDonaldTrump - business as usual trying to be nice - was not working inside or outside USA.
@realdonaldtrump Don't worry Richard, money isn't everything. Those "prestigious" law firms you mentioned? They are now on my psychic warfare "hit list". Power is more potent than money.

The REAL America would have helped. The @realDonaldTrump version of America won't because it's not a white population & they can't give him anything worth while in exchange. #DonTheCon #DonTheDictator

@HowieCarrShow has given him the best nickname, Pickle Nose. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
When @realDonaldTrump gets done, it will be as if Obama was never even in office. His whole presidency is illigitimate, he isn't even a citizen of the U.S. He is a foreign operative who has infiltrated our government, and is now working to subvert our duly elected president.
Oh, just for the heck of it, @realDonaldTrump why capitalize Trial? Best words, huh?
@POTUS , @realDonaldTrump , The Power's of the President give you the Legal choice to Either start a new #Specialcounsel , or order the Documents declassified for congress oversight! You must take action! Fire Rod and Jeff pic.twitter.com/ib578971Ip
