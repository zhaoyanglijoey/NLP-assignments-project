@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is #Disgusting . A fist raising for himself? D I S G U S T I N G. Kudos, however, to the speech writer. Luckily for him/her is that the #MoronInChief read it verbatim. (U might need to give him the definition of verbatim)

I didn't sleep well in the 8 years of his presidency, now I do under @realDonaldTrump . I feel so much safer because Trump loves us,
Seems more like U @phitchy know nothing about what's going on politically right this moment!Pay attention! @realDonaldTrump Republican Party is the one FOR The People more than any other party in recent history!
This is what happens when you have leftists owning our Country's MSM!They're the Democrats propaganda machine!They're no longer journalists, they're rendering Opinions only. No longer reporting facts, they're simply indoctrinating Americans. @realDonaldTrump @dbongino @SebGorka

Where is the head of FEMA in these photos? Is @VP briefing @realDonaldTrump ? I would love to sit in on that session.
Hey @realDonaldTrump , what say you???
@realDonaldTrump was in Pennsylvania to remember the 3000 that died on 9/11 17 years ago because it was a national tragedy. 3000 Americans died in Puerto Rico and calls it a tremendous success. pic.twitter.com/aqQ0Ew7zbD
@JoeNBC I remember @realDonaldTrump , when he was the darling guest on the Morning Joe he even joked about being the President. Can't you give it a rest and be thankful on this day of remembrance.
Yo, idiot @realDonaldTrump the #of people that die DURING a hurricane isn't how you measure whether or not you're "successful" in a response, the almost 3000 YOU LET DIE say otherwise. People still don't have power, hospitals still closed #JonesAct #BloodOnYourHands #FuckTrump

How long before @realDonaldTrump realizes it's September 11th...lets see He treated this morning. 7:08am- No Russian collusion 7:19am- Strzok attack 7:41am- Eric Holder attack 7:59am- Rudy Guliani great ...90 minutes later @POTUS realized Americans sacrificed themselves at 8:24.
How come someone hasn't photoshopped dildos into the fists of @realDonaldTrump in this photo yet? pic.twitter.com/9QOSonrc3N

@realDonaldTrump you murdered by criminal negligence 2900 Americans in Puerto Rico. Today, on the anniversary of 9/11, you BRAGGED about it. What kind of sick bastard are you?
@realDonaldTrump isn't suited to be buried. But I look forward to the day it happens.

@realDonaldTrump always good at praising himself for his DISGRACEFUL ACTIONS TAKEN TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO! HISTORY WILL TELL THE TRUTH!

@realDonaldTrump Hey asshole the first pump today before your speech? CLASSLESS CLUELESS FOOL
At 8:00 eastern time Cable channel AHC is showing "Hitler - The Fall" explaining his mental and physical decline as he faces defeat. Maybe @realDonaldTrump should watch it.
#ToddlerInChief @realDonaldTrump once again proves HE'S NOT AN AMERICAN with the bullshit he's pulling. No matter what he does, #MuellerIsComing for him as well as others spearheading investigations on him and we'll hunt him down, too. #TrumpIsACriminal #TrumpIsUnfit #FuckTrump

@DonaldJTrumpJr , you do know your crime cannot be pardoned by your #FatNixonDad @realDonaldTrump , right? Secondly, you are being investigated by multiple agencies. Good luck with your butt! https:// youtu.be/rgmvDdUM2EU
Seventeen years ago, as America and the world were forever changed, @realDonaldTrump called a local news station to brag (lie) that the fall of the Twin Towers meant his building at 40 Wall St. became the tallest structure in NYC. #NeverForget Trump's a narcissistic a$$hole
Obama allowed illegal aliens to steal 39 million Social Security numbers! We must stop these crooks! Build the Wall! @realDonaldTrump
@funder @realDonaldTrump I thought he said he was in NJ watching people dancing in the street? That's what he said anyway. BS
@realDonaldTrump you are a disgrace and embarrassment to the people of the country which you govern.

@realDonaldTrump 's success in #PuertoRico is #unsung primarily because it was a miserable failure that cost the lives of 3,000 Americans - about as many as the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That's why folks around the @WhieteHouse call @POTUS #moron
Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks @realDonaldTrump hit the ground in NYC to be with the people. Today @POTUS is on the ground fighting for #WeThePeople . #NeverForget911 pic.twitter.com/ReLCZxqYsP

When did @SaraCarterDC and @LouDobbs become National Security experts. Shame on you @realDonaldTrump for denigrating @FBI on 9/11.

THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump

@SenatorCollins are you hearing the people who put you where you are or just @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP . I think the people whom you were hired to represent are speaking loudly and you insult them. Vote no, voting yes is for Trump.

Because @realDonaldTrump tweeted, I just saved $[insert amount] for [insert your reason here]!
I was there....1st seeing this memorial in Shanksville. Lots of #maga hats and shirts. Thank u for coming @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS
While u have an adorable family...I WOULD NOT EVEN BUY A SOCK FROM YOU LET ALONE A BOOK YOU WROTE ABOUT YOUR HATRED FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE USA. The exception with buying a sock from you, would only be if I could stuff it in your TOTALLY NEGATIVE, HATEFUL MOUTH @realDonaldTrump
Contrast thus with @realDonaldTrump 's "17 years since September 11!" Canadians, for those of you who are attacking Trudeau in this thread, we will trade you straight up for Trump any day of the week. How's tomorrow for you? #Rootsistance
On the 17th anniversary of 9/11, let us remember THIS is what @HillaryClinton was doing. Let's also remember 3 million+ more of us voted for her, than for @realDonaldTrump , who was on the phone, lying about Muslims, & boasting he now had the tallest building in NYC. #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/ZlY29m6O2q

@realDonaldTrump actually just said that Hurricane Florence will be tremendously wet. #WhoKnewAnyoneCouldBeThisDumb #YouCantMakeThisUp #ThatsRightITaggedHim
@realDonaldTrump Rush Limbaugh's radio broadcast today was fantastic. He said that the Mueller investigation is unconstitutional and should have never started - because there is no crime. And after 2 years of wasting tax payer's money, it needs to stop and now. God bless you!
The best deficit. The highest deficit in years! No one has come close to getting the deficit this high! Congratulations @realDonaldTrump

I wonder if any of @realDonaldTrump attorneys have told him that, to a criminal defense lawyer, he acts and sounds like a garden variety criminal.
In what world would anyone refer to the deaths of almost 3,000 people as an unsung success? Oh almost no one except the empty-hearted narcissistic @realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/azc0Bb70bG
@realDonaldTrump he was taking a shit in his depends.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1 campaigned on #ruleoflaw & it will be upheld. The @BarackObama fraud is #FANNIEGATE
@realDonaldTrump @potus @WhiteHouse What the hell is wrong with this man?
And racist Pussygrabber's ( @realDonaldTrump ) will be massively stupid and his response to the hurricane will be massively inadequate just as it was in Puerto Rico!!!
My 9 year old said @realDonaldTrump is what you get when you cross a potato with an ant when he heard him say hurricanes are wet. My kid is smarter than the entire @GOP and certainly smarter than our russian loving @POTUS
