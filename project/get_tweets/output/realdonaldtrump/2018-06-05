wow. @realDonaldTrump @nflcommish @NFLPA . I didn't often agree with Obama, but he is a Leader. Now we have a president that has gone out of his way - like a mean-spirited child - to disrespect @NFL players - not even attempting to truly understand WHY they are protesting.
Get rid of @realDonaldTrump and the rest and this problem will end...
@realDonaldTrump #FlyEaglesFly Propaganda and the truth are polar opposites. One is built on nothingness, the other on solid rock. One is inaccurate. The other is inalienable. You are a sad individual. God bless what soul you have. @Eagles fan since 1988
@realDonaldTrump 's kiss of death. He spread his loser curse all morning. Hahahah
However, my mother also supports @realDonaldTrump , so I don't really know what will happen here.
So if this were true, @realDonaldTrump WHERE are the President Obama children containment camps?
If @realDonaldTrump pardons Manafort it will add to his obstruction of justice and abuse of power. We have to make the Republicans fear us more than fear their base. Let's figure out how to do that. Me importantly we have to vote them out. We need more offense.
It, @realDonaldTrump will not make it to the end. #ResistandSucceed
Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION! 5:35 AM - Mar 18, 2018 124K 118K
First of all, there is nothing good about @realDonaldTrump . If you think for a second he cares anything about you or anybody besides himself, maybe you need to take some courses in the psychiatric field instead of just the medical field. You can't see the forest for the trees.
It's a wonderful time to be alive in America. @potus @realDonaldTrump
now his relationship wit Kim depends on Rodman. I hope he SPILLS THE BEANS on @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I have a bad credit rating...they want a down payment....although i pay everything else on time, the banks wont trust me with a loan....for a home...I am hispanic...my dad came to this country to work on chicago railroads during ww2....needed manpower...the story
@KingJames @realDonaldTrump Life long Cleveland fan and have total respect for what LBJ has given back to Ohio. No one wants an invite to the WH ? Wrong ! I do and so do millions of others. Be open minded. Be committed to your team. 1 yr contracts is not team building. Kyrie ?
How's it feel Iowa? Top producers of pork TO Mexico.. How you like those 25% tariffs? Ooh, Kentucky? Not the bourbon!! I'm vegan, and I'm an Irish Whiskey kinda gal.. Thank @realDonaldTrump for what's coming next to break your pockets!!
@Judgenap is a leftist sleeper, he wants Trump to be entangled in this mess so he uses every opportunity to use misinformation and incorrect legal analysis to confuse and create doubt in @realDonaldTrump base of supporters! #NapolitanoIsARat
I think it's time to make these briefs not televised, then all the drama will stop! @realDonaldTrump

In the lead up to the Singapore summit, with NK monitoring US media even more closely than usual, allowing the president to be disrespected by a team would not have been helpful. As usual, @realDonaldTrump made the right move.
This Is Why We Elected @realDonaldTrump ..Hate Him If You Must But He Is One Of Us & Will Be Re-Elected..Go Get Him @iancollinsuk ..This Howard Is Mad At Who He Is
I hereby pledge I will stand against the carnage being waged upon our country by the corrupt, complicit, immoral, ugly @POTUS @realDonaldTrump , his family & his horrendous administration defiling the WH. Rublicans no longer stand for the rule of law. The world sees it too.

#SaveAliWazir #StopUsingTalibanAgainstPTM The international community must breake their silence regarding pakistans dubble standered policy, and ask pakistany army to choose one side. Eather be with the world or with terroriest. @UNHumanRights @UN @realDonaldTrump
Now isnt this what Hitler's plan was. "They were bred to be the elite of Hitler's 1,000-year Reich but ended up cowed by shame, alienation and uncertainty for decades" welcome to @BarackObama ville @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @RealJamesWoods @chuckwoolery @dbongino
@realDonaldTrump NBA teams said they won't go to WH. Good. Don't invite. Don't say anything about them. Their loss. Don't give them the lio serviceberries to promote them. Even controversial. Deny them controversy.
Boo hoo hoo Obama is so distraught. More of His "legacy" is going bye-bye? His dream of an Iran on the way to nuclear weapons Up In Smoke. Thank you God and thank @realDonaldTrump
Not only has @JohnCornyn lost all his ethics, he is now sounding like @realDonaldTrump in his tweets. Now that is SAD! I ask you again, where are the statesmen?
Just place a picture of @realDonaldTrump on the urinal cake.

I have great appreciation of your respect for the truth and your dogmatic refusal to abandon it in these unspeakable times in the life of our goverment. @realDonaldTrump
Democrats will vote no even if it's a good deal just so they don't give a win to @realDonaldTrump They would prefer nuclear war. #MAGA

Wow. @realdonaldtrump was successful in getting 3 Americans released in Korea. That's not so great. Obama once released 4 or 5 in the Middle East. Oh, wait. those were traitors and terrorists. Okay. now that makes sense
Why do pampered pros who win only a US title get a @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse visit? Honor should be for USA jersey-wearing/uniformed, flag-bearing patriots REPRESENTING #USA in International events. #MAGA
If @realDonaldTrump pardons himself, it is the same as when King Henry VIII declared himself the head of the Church of England and granted himself a divorce. In the USA, NO ONE is above the law.
You seem a tad paranoid, Jim. Get some help. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/S2AFZNJWmV

History will record President Trump as the greatest POTUS EVER! Our #MAGA mvmt, & the election of @realDonaldTrump will be hailed as the "2nd American Revolution! " This Revolution was fought & won w/out bullets being fired....but thru @Potus Tweets! #Deplorables
@realDonaldTrump So, did you stand on those paiful temp bonespurs when you gutlessly dodged the draft for VietNam?
Unlike @realDonaldTrump in similar circumstances of racial tension.

@realDonaldTrump I went to the capital of my state of Texas In Austin. While I was there I went to the VA. I saw a picture of you and I got pissed. This picture didn't have your name. That you are our 45 President. Nothing but your picture. This need's to be address. Mike Hadley
You can't blame @realDonaldTrump . There wouldn't be anyone there if they weren't allowed to hire criminals.

Right...and because they said, it must be true...just like everything @realDonaldTrump has said. What an effing joke.
@realDonaldTrump said 1000 @Eagles fans would be attending the fake celebration today. Question: if you attended please shout out. Their story was that the fans weren't necessarily from Philly but from other parts of the country.
I am a white, privileged, straight female... Until @realDonaldTrump is out of office, I am a man, I am gay, I am trans, I am black, I am muslim, I am Mexican, I am Puerto Rican, I am poor, I am an immigrant, I am a child slave, I am unlawfully incarcerated, I am an American.
He actually falsely accused the president of having a history of abusing women! I think @realDonaldTrump should sue him for slander!
yup i am totally shadowbanned...used to get at least like 100 plus RT and now ZIP maybe 3 if i am lucky but whatever...I will still keep posting til they shut me down! WWG1WGA! MAGA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
I totally agree with what your saying. I support President Trump but still think something should be done for the players that wanted to attend. @realDonaldTrump
@SenateMajLdr History will judge you, and it will be harsh. Sometimes I wonder who's skin is thinner. Yours, or @realDonaldTrump 's.

@realDonaldTrump it's a good thing Ms Sadler is no longer on the American payroll.
@realDonaldTrump , if you cannot take criticism and can only whine, you are not welcomed in a democratic society. #TrumpResign #ImpeachTrump
Why do @realDonaldTrump and his disciples enjoy throwing around the phrase 'shoot somebody' and then act like being casual about violence is okay. . .?
Just in from Twitter: if you don't know the full lyrics to literally every single patriotic song you are a RUSSIAN AGENT and have NO RIGHT to criticize the NFL. #GodBlessAmerica @realDonaldTrump #Trump
