Funny how @realDonaldTrump also "runs with the rogues".
Yo america remember when @realDonaldTrump said 7/11?
@MichaelAvenatti you are getting your ass whipped by @realDonaldTrump over & over! Maybe @StormyDaniels should have told the truth. She didn't sleep with TRMP, she took a picture with him & extortion? Who got you into this mess? @MichaelCohen212 Remember the dvd? Where is that?
Come on @realDonaldTrump . What were you trying to say on @60Minutes last night? Clean energy is not a jobs killer but a HUGE job creator. http:// bit.ly/2Eoyz0p pic.twitter.com/hguGayunwO
@realDonaldTrump I'mma watch but if I catch you giving a trick $300,000 for some pussy again I know something NO cap
So @laurenbaer America has a shameful history now?? If anyone is attacking American values it's you& #Dems Ms Baer. Yet you attack @realDonaldTrump & lie about him and Mast's record as a distraction for your failure. @BrianMastFL Is a true #Patriot and he has my vote pic.twitter.com/dDfi6V82MA
Proving that what @realDonaldTrump said is the GOP are worse then the democrats because at least you know where there coming from. The GOP let this slip this long on purpose. There all talk................. #DrainTheSwamp
The secret revealed why @trumpcasinos went bankcrupt. @realDonaldTrump never honors his bets. It is only hot air. This is the character of @POTUS potus. A con-man who's words cannot be trusted. Halleluja.
@realDonaldTrump seeing as Warren is 1/1024 of a native american. Can you please pay 1/1024th of your promised donation to charity. It's only fair.
Thanks Joe but if you want even more racism got @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls or Donald Trump Jr. Then tune into his rally tonight
Gee, I wonder how he might have figured it out? Looked at history? Actually @stevenmnuchin1 knew it beforehand and just lied because @realDonaldTrump told him to.
Meanwhile, real Native Americans are furious.I spent some time reading some responses, they are very upset. She needs to stop with this lie and apologize to them. Shame on you @SenWarren . @realDonaldTrump
@DonaldJTrumpJr are these the Mobs you and @GOP are tweeting about. @realDonaldTrump band of Merry White-hooded Men.

I continue to find the dialogue of @realdonaldtrump about @senatorWarren to be outrageous, cruel & unfit for @potus . @melaniatrump needs to tell him to "Be Best" along with the other children bullies she's trying to change. @officegovethics @GOP @CREWcrew
@realDonaldTrump 1/1024th of a Million should just about cover it. America's laughter is free. pic.twitter.com/ICmhSP3F5z

Imagine @realDonaldTrump taking a DNA test and having more Native American DNA than Pocahontas does?!
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU CURSE THAT PLACE FOR ME @realDonaldTrump
pretty ironic though @realDonaldTrump how many bankruptcies have you had in a lot less time
#WeThePeople #GreatAwakening #WWG1WGA #POTUS #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #QAnon #QArmy Senate intelligence staffer who dated reporter pleads guilty to lying to FBI about leaks https:// fxn.ws/2IWoeaq #FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump So you stated (as the tape was just shown on Fox News) that you would donate one Million DOLLARS to a charity of her choice if she did DNA to prove her Native American Heritage. SO WHY ARE YOU BACKING OUT NOW. TRUMP YOU ARE A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR
Why didn't YOUR #Democratic Party File Charges Against . @realDonaldTrump Between 2008-16 when #democrats controlled & weaponized the . @IRS ? Which party put tax loopholes in place? Again, that would be the #Democrat party. #Fauxcahontas #FAUXAHONTAS #WarrenIsNotCherokee
Once again you have lied to viewers, only the defamation suit was dismissed the suit against Cohen and @realDonaldTrump will proceed. I am thinking that you wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the face.
Madam, you - like @DNC @SenWarren et al - still dont get 2016. @realDonaldTrump is not a professional politician, nor a corrupt incompetent @HillaryClinton
@realDonaldTrump WHAT A GROSS FKR. WHAT, HE WANTS TO HAVE @SenWarren PISS ON HIM?? IS THAT HIS DNA TEST #AMERICA ????
@realDonaldTrump you said that you'd pay a million dollars to charity of Senator Warren did a DNA test and prove she was Native American. Now you're trying to back away from your own words. Odd coming from the same guy who sued Bill Maher for questioning your own DNA...

@elizabethforma haha 5 hairs on Warren's head are possibly native American, and probably not the grey ones either #Pocahontas #ElizabethWarren #Warren #Fauxcahontas @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump so many people are asking you to declassify fisa warrants. Why? Are you not doing this?
Now only 2 possible outcomes for Rosenstein after he refused to testify! 1) There's been a psyop on the #DeepState from the very beginning and #RodRosenstein is working undercover with @realDonaldTrump 's administration to expose their Treason/Sedition. 2) America Executes him!
Who's the bigger joke...Micheal Avenatti as a lawyer or Elizabeth Warren as a Native American? @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @elizabethforma @MichaelAvenatti
@realDonaldTrump GET RID OF OBAMACARE!! The Majority of people (ages 21-55) DON'T even go to the doctor for a simple checkup.. Because WE cannot afford the deductible!! It takes all we can to provide routine care for our children under this HORRIBLE care act!!

Hey what are you guys doing about the reporter killed in Saudi Arabia? You know it could hurt all of your contacts and business deals. And btw @realDonaldTrump took HOW MANY DAYS to go to areas affected by the HURRICANE? Too busy with Kanye to care

That is called Treason and Sedition. @realDonaldTrump
You're welcome to your opinions but as for your prediction of a blue wave, we will see. Like it or not, Bots didn't vote @realDonaldTrump in and God Will Indeed Get the Last Word. In God We Trust One Nation Under God

@realDonaldTrump Ducking a bet. Standard egomaniac. "I never said it", "I want to test her myself before I'd pay"... Find pride in admitting your failures, fool.
@realDonaldTrump have a stroke please
@veracityplus1 @juradolori love this #TrumpTrain #Trump2020 @realDonaldTrump #RedWaveRising2018
Wah, wah. She made @realDonaldTrump look like the fool he is. Just spent $113 billion to move unemployment from 3.9% to 3.7%. Not too bright.
Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his taxes. Put up or shut up... pic.twitter.com/8SeFydQHww
Brilliant idea. Someone should Co tact artist. @realDonaldTrump would most likely love it. And I'm not being sarcastic.
Yes and if enough people ask @realDonaldTrump to #PardonAssange he will hopefully listen!!
If @SenWarren wants to win in 2020, she needs to promise that: 1. She will scalp @realDonaldTrump ; 2. She will teach every American how to grow corn. #ElizabethWarren2020
Playing AC odyssey. I had a random thought. If they made a modern version of it who would be on either side. I'm pretty sure @BarackObama would be an assassin and @realDonaldTrump would be apart of the Templars.
DEAR MICHAEL AVENATTI ... KARMA Stormy Daniels @realDonaldTrump #POTUS #Kavanaugh
@realDonaldTrump you are dancing on the graves of the 911 victims and our brave veterans. Saudi Arabia is a rogue terrorist country. They gave us 911, yet our President is blatantly lying to us on their behalf.
