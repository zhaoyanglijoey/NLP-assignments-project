Just saw @jaketapper do a story comparing @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS as Archie and Edith Bunker. Jake, at the risk of sounding juvenile and unprofessional, you are a total dick for reporting this way. ...and you wonder why nobody watches CNN
@realDonaldTrump Donald, to tell you to kiss my ass is too good for you, so I'm telling you to kiss your own.
Another of @realDonaldTrump or @GOP surrogates attempts at distraction.

Too late. @chelseahandler blamed @realDonaldTrump for those issues a couple of months ago.
@cnn - what actual proof do you have of @realDonaldTrump saying shithole - video? audio? Nope! Only never Trump Dems and Republicans right? Then it is #fakenews as usual
I was amazed, when you can't even recognize any of the actors it makes the movie all the more enjoyable!! @realDonaldTrump was right! It is awesome!

The only reason @realDonaldTrump doesn't perjured himself is because he hasn't testify before Congress. The pathological liar won't disappoint us.

@realDonaldTrump Please apologize for the remarks you made about certain countries. They are an embarrassment to your lofty office, to you as a person, and to every American. It's time to end the bigotry.
@realDonaldTrump has repeatedly claimed he's "the least racist person." The record suggests otherwise. http:// bit.ly/2D8qRp3
I see why. @realDonaldTrump has shown how inept every other world leader is. In 1yr POTUS TRUMP has done more for the working middle-class families than Obama wanted to do in 8yrs.
All elections should have ICE agents on standby to deport illegals trying to vote @realDonaldTrump

@potus @realDonaldTrump This is funny.... Trump is being run by Stephan Miller now that Bannon is gone. Trump just can't do the job using his talents. Depends on others thinking.
Pakistan's job is to get the hand from Pakistan and strike it on the back. These Pakistani government and army blame the public on the people of Balochistan, keep terrorists and pretend to be honest from the outside #FreeBalochistan @BRP_MediaCell @StateDept @UN @realDonaldTrump
During the campaign, @RealDonaldTrump lied to you (shocker) about the size of the U.S. trade deficit w/China. Said it was $500 billion. Even with it growing 10% during his first year as president, it's nowhere close to that /2
Wrong! Just like the poll that had Hitlery beating @realDonaldTrump . Another Snowflake Lib Fantasy Number. Keep it up @POTUS will keep #Winning #MAGA2018 #CBTS_stream #winning #maga #Qanon #8chan #LockThemAllUp #stablegenius #DeepState

With cameras on, . @realDonaldTrump should confront Durbin. Ask him why he lied? Which reporter at CNN urged him to do this? Openly confronting these liars has to start happening.
BABY @realDonaldTrump LOL What a cutie!

Reversed what economic decline????? Obama brought this nation back from the worst economic recession in decades. Once again, @foxandfriends and @realDonaldTrump are completely wrong.
agree & as per @PressSec , the #VoterFraudCommittee was dismantled BC Dems & Deep State like D-Dunlap were Obstructionists throughout the duration. Unlike Dems, @realDonaldTrump didn't want to waste taxpayer & DHS can continue #DNCVoterFraudInvestigation #KobachSupportsTrump

@TGowdySC is stepping down from his ethics committee position and @realDonaldTrump should consider him for Attorney General especially since present Attorney General Sessions isn't producing the way Trump is accustomed of his employees.

Our current @POTUS might allay some drug use if he would kindly resign. Every time he opens his mouth, it leads to embarrassment, anxiety and #Shame . @realDonaldTrump has become a #ReasonToSelfMedicate . Maybe if y'all medicated him, that would help.
@realDonaldTrump never mentioned anything about HAITI but guess what, HAITI is a shithole . I said it
Lol! I guess they don't want us to know that the rest of his day is also doing absolutely nothing. @realDonaldTrump is a WEAK leader!

When the @WhiteHouse edits the words the @realDonaldTrump spews, YOU, nor anyone there has any right to complain about something POSSIBLY being misquoted. (we won't even get into the outright lies)
As the labor participation rate stagnates while unemployment rate falls to 17 year lows... how should we interpret this? Let's ask @realDonaldTrump and candidate Trump.
The MSM want so desperately for the slur to be true that it will matter little that the only one making the claim is someone who is a proven liar during virtually the same circumstances. At least @realDonaldTrump now knows that he can't trust Democrats to be honest abt anything.
Your time Madame Speaker would be better spent in trying to help your constituents and by constituents I mean Dreamers who will lose all hope unless you and your cronies start negotiating in good faith with @realDonaldTrump ...
How can Hawaii have this going on on the other 48 states are blissfully ignorant of what is going on? Why didn't military step in to kill it if false? Did we have an increase in security levels at SAC???? @realDonaldTrump @TulsiGabbard

@realDonaldTrump keep going on your correct path the critics are crickets
Agreed. Melania also falsely claimed a college degree to bolster her immigration status. She lied. Under the law, she can be stripped of her citizenship & deported. #MAGA , right @realDonaldTrump ?
Well, thanks to @realDonaldTrump , Warren G. Harding will no longer be considered the worst president... Scraping the bottom of the barrel here, trying to come up with some upsides.
It isn't worth destroying your dignity, integrity & humanity to lie for @realDonaldTrump , @GOP senators. #UnfitToBePresident #ImpeachNow
Our increasingly #SenilePresident @realDonaldTrump could learn a thing or 2,600 from @POTUS44 and @whoisgarylee about what makes this country great. Or maybe remember that his grandfather came here as an immigrant.
