Also, as he's reading the teleprompter, he looks like there is a gun to his head, gritting his teeth. He hates to back down. Expect the @realDonaldTrump unleashed, reckless and destructive back at it again within 24 hours. Wonder who got him to say the presidential stuff. Ivanka?
Don't believe that bullshit from him or @realDonaldTrump follow the money @FBI
@WHITEHOUSE @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS we NEED YOU IN LOS ANGELES!!!
@realDonaldTrump look at the weather radar at barksdale air force base and tell me their not controlling our weather!
Watching @cspan 3 to see my @POTUS 45 speaking at Rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin! God Thank you for giving us @realDonaldTrump who is #MakingAmericaGreatAgain & we will gladly Vote for him again 2020! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2018 God Bless this GREAT man!
Ready for Wisconsin rally @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/ZnKsCa6KZM
@realDonaldTrump F*ck You! pic.twitter.com/jPQSL4Mk4y
I'll be shocked and disappointed if President Trump stops criticizing Dems. His criticisms are valid, and our nation cannot afford to let their scare tactics work. Criticize them all you want, @realDonaldTrump ! I support you!
You think the "bombs" were sent by a Corey Booker supporter? He is being stupid by trying to stoop to @realDonaldTrump 's level. He is not very good at it. Watch your boy at his "rally" and listen to his words. He will step in it again.
It is impossible to divorce @realDonaldTrump from the fact that Trump has targeted each of the Democrats targeted by bombs today. Donald Trump's rhetorical hateful words have preceded the actions that intended to kill Democrats. Trump is responsible for the scorched Earth attack!
We need you in Florida @realDonaldTrump for @RonDeSantisFL . Please help!
@realDonaldTrump 's HATE WORDS perceive VIOLENT ACTS of shootings & bombs @cnni @thehill @usatodayDC @Reuters @NBCNews @NewYorker @Washingtonpost @guardiannews @nytimes @voxdotcom @BostonGlobe @TheDemCoalition @MSNBC @politico @Lawrence @HuffPostPol @UN @axios @maddow @TIME @MSNBC
My prediction is that @realDonaldTrump will say the EXACT same type of anti-press, anti-Democratic inflammatory rhetoric at his rally tonight that he has at every rally. Nothing will change.
Tune in to @WBAY online at http:// WBAY.com now, where @realDonaldTrump is speaking live.
@HardballChris How soon people forget! Some people think that maybe the Democrats concocted fake bombs to slow down trumps rallies! @MSNBC @morningmika @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump @larryelder @RealJamesWoods @IngrahamAngle MAGA pic.twitter.com/VU0FR2QxTS
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC U R NO PREZ OF US. CHANGE UR RHETORIC & STOP THIS. EVERYONE HERE IS EQUAL. U R TELLING IDIOTS 2 KILL-BE VIOLENT & U DID THIS. AND U WILL DO IT AGAIN. U R NOT QUALIFIED 2 BE MY PREZ. UR VIOLENT 'RALLIES' R AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE....GOP
@realDonaldTrump will not stop. Look at what is happening. People almost killed and what are we talking about? TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP. That is exactly what he wants.
Another GREAT turnout for @realDonaldTrump @POTUS rally! I AM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN! #PromisesmadePromiseKept pic.twitter.com/M66qOvqbWK
@FLOTUS @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump You were just talking about the opioid problem today. He is one possible solution. Safe alternatives.
Our GREAT @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is at the podium in LIVE in Mosinee, WISCONSIN!!! Watch the ENTIR rally on One American News @OANN !!! ENJOY
@FoxNews is as desperate as @realDonaldTrump
And they have a possible 210,000,000 more seconds until Jan 2025 of HATE TRUMP @potus @realDonaldTrump ahead of them. I truly feel sorry for them.
@realDonaldTrump Had any of those bombs killed people, their blood would have been on your hands. Normally I wouldn't attribute blame in that way, but you incite, incite, incite violence and hate at every opportunity, so this one is yours.
Replying to @realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker and @LeahVukmir . Save America. Vote red
@realDonaldTrump wonder where someone would get the idea to use violence against the opposition? Maybe because you praise those who do. #WordsMatter Trump praises Gianforte for body slamming reporter https:// youtu.be/QwiaCUUScqc via @YouTube
. @MSNBC . @cnn . @realDonaldTrump #trumps MO is reverse psychology. Trump & his base have the same mentality & same IQ. He spews out irrational ideas at his rallies. Trump doesn't know any facts, which is why his rallies don't have substance & his base doesn't know any better!
Vote @realDonaldTrump 's CORRUPT @GOP out of power!
Very busy day in America. @kroger had a mass shooting, pipe bombs were sent to @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @CNN @RepMaxineWaters . Is this the "winning" you spoke of @realDonaldTrump and @GOP ? #FUMAGA
@realDonaldTrump choose right words for a change would be great
So, @realDonaldTrump basically just told the country DO AS I SAY NOT AS I DO, eh? His slogan should have been "Got violence?" for f*ck sake
@axlrose @Slash @gunsnroses News footage from another Trump rally tngt had G&R'"November Rain"playing in the background pre-rally. As an avid 31yr G&R fan,I implore you to please restrict @realDonaldTrump from playing your awesome tunes at his hateful, ego stroking rallies. #basta
God,Please keep our President safe @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Are the illegal immigrants getting vacines? We have new strains of deseases, is this why?
Because @realDonaldTrump tweeted, I just saved $1 with #Qapital !
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka @dbongino @FoxNews I guess we all want to know if any of the packages had bomb in it, were any detonated? #VoteRedToSaveAmerica #JobsNotMobs
@realDonaldTrump fkn moron
@POTUS @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @WHITEHOUSE @NAACP @BLMLA
Chinese and Russian spies are listening in to President @realDonaldTrump 's iPhone calls: NYP reports
A real president would call up Hillary and the rest of the targets of these deadly bombs to offer support. A real president would cancel a partisan political rally and firmly condemn ALL violence. Instead, @realDonaldTrump has called NONE of the targets & will hold his rally.
This is not a both sides issue this is a @realDonaldTrump Fake 45, @GOP , and @FoxNews issue. They are the ones screaming like lunatics that @TheDemocrats are a mob they want to replace you with brown people. Scare tactics are the only thing they know because they can't beat us.
We get what we deserve. If we can't win the House back in November, and if we can't vote @realDonaldTrump out of office in 2020, then we deserve the douchebag.
@Scaramucci why don't u quit talking 4 @realDonaldTrump , you don't know what he means or doesn't mean.. your an idiot what is wrong with saying your a nationalist which means he advocates 4 political independence so just shut up & go away..
Trump called for unity because of the bombs sent to President Obama, Hillary Clinton and CNN. I laughed. A man who devotes most of his time to dividing the country wants us to come together as one. You're the problem @realDonaldTrump #ShitholePresident #Traitor #Fraud #Liar
Very Important to go out and to VOTE. - Robert Merritt @RealDonaldTrump "Anonymous: Only One Man Can Stop Them!" https:// youtu.be/xRT9Us9qWd0 via @YouTube
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump YOU BE SMART #MAGA #WinningWithTrump
@realDonaldTrump should have cancelled the rally; he knows the people he's whipped into a hate filled frenzy will be cheering these attempted murders.
Has anyone ever been to a @realDonaldTrump rally? I have and I can attest that the women there are some of the most gorgeous ones I have ever seen.
All the democrat politicians left their voters standing at the alter to go fight @realDonaldTrump in fear of losing their Washington gravy train
@CNN thankyou for covering this, but it's clear @realDonaldTrump promoted this terrorism and he is complicit in creating a militia who is committing acts of war on American soil. Trump has promoted terrorism, he failed to condemn it, and now it's happening. He caused it.
@realDonaldTrump no back to that Trojan Horse coming to our southern border!
@realDonaldTrump is the leader of a terrorist group. Inciting violence against his own country. TRAITOR
God Bless @realDonaldTrump and God Bless #AMERICA

Tuning away from @FoxNews as @realDonaldTrump and not repeated news is on! @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @marthamaccallum @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
@realDonaldTrump how does it feel to be the worse Fake Prez ever? Using unsecured phone line allowed China to spy on your calls. What a Dumbass
It was a terrorist act committed against our nation. Say the word, Name it. T...... Despicable a mild for a series of bomb attacks on two former American presidents. Name it, set the tone, call these act out @realDonaldTrump
Hmm, I wonder if this might contribute a disturbed person to go over the edge and maybe send a bomb to the media @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/JGiHJkS80C
U need to talk to your boss @realDonaldTrump who incites violence at every rally
@realDonaldTrump Lack of leadership and humanity. Earlier he said we need to.unify the country, so much for that. Two faced liar.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for reaching across the aisle and condemning this, even though it was only targeted at Dems
Facts and science have never mattered to @realDonaldTrump or @GOP
Just another one of your lies !!! MoreFake News from you !! Pre-Existing Conditions =Obamacare.. @washingtonpost @CNN @matthewjdowd @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @kenolin1
I believe the the Mega Lottery winner has more money than @realDonaldTrump We know how much they are worth, but Trump has yet to come forward to prove anything to the American public!
And yet, @realDonaldTrump still leads the chanting of "lock her up" on a nearly nightly basis.
And @realDonaldTrump is in north central Wisconsin. @WSAW pic.twitter.com/NKbzn158YI
. @realDonaldTrump takes the stage. Full coverage tonight at 10pm. #WKOW pic.twitter.com/1Zh4y4Ey9n
Absolutely I support this move America must be protected from these Criminal Invaders. Who are not vaccinated. These are diseased people who carry MERSA, cholera, polio, and other diseases that have been eradicated from The USA. They must be stopped at any cost. @realDonaldTrump
So, I @realDonaldTrump , am done commenting on the terrorist acts I encouraged and caused!!
Stop! Mark here is full on @realDonaldTrump supporter and will not ever consider the possibility that he and his Trump erred!
. @realDonaldTrump takes the stage just after Frank Sinatra's "My Way" ends.
Hey @realDonaldTrump a birthday shout-out for my big 4-0 would just make my day from number 45!!!
@realDonaldTrump April Ryan just blamed Trump for some threat she says she got. I think she's a liar and I would have to see proof but she just now blamed Trump on air with Jake Tapper .

The only thing @realDonaldTrump is upset about is that the #MAGABomber didn't kill every last one of his intended targets! #Trump is #dangerous so #VoteBlue #vote @kyrstensinema in AZ. #VoteBetoForTexas #vote @staceyabrams in Georgia #vote @RosenforNevada @SenatorHeitkamp ND
. @ChrisSununu said he'd welcome the endorsement of @realDonaldTrump . I'm done. His campaign likes to pretend he's a moderate, but the reality is that he's in lockstep with Trump's radical agenda. NH doesn't need that. #nhgov #nhpolitics
The thing that would calm the political divide would be the media & the dems reassuring the public that the 2016 election was fairly won by @realDonaldTrump & stop all the conspiracies & lies about him. That is what spills over to all the rest of the resist nonsense & violence.
America is gradually becoming one big dumb down society, thanks to @realDonaldTrump #MAGABomber
My exact thoughts. I would put nothing past the evil dems, look at the underhanded rigged scene they tried to pull with Kavanaugh. They are THAT desperate! Speaking of, Ford disappeared just as quick as she came! #RedWaveRising2018 #DemocratsAreDangerous @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump has said nothing bad about you yet.. Hillary Backfired, Russia Backfires Daca Backfires, Mexico Backfired, Puerto Rico Back Fired, Comey Backfired, Mueller Backfired, Roseanne Backfired, Kavanaugh Backfired, Ford Backfired, Stormy Backfired, Caravan Backfires,TBC
@realDonaldTrump fuck you, you violence enticing mother fucker.
The media's job is to question you. @realDonaldTrump YOU NEED TO ACT LIKE A LEADER AND STOP ATTACKING THOSE THAT DISAGREE WITH YOU!
D-Day Invasion https:// grrrgraphics.com/d-day-invasion/ @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

Wow, @jaketapper . Way to bait your audience to speak against @realDonaldTrump about these suspicious packages being mailed. No evidence this is tied to #POTUS . #FakeNewsCNN
How sickening that this is now a normal day in @realDonaldTrump 's MAGAit. RESIGN & COMMIT yourself!

@realDonaldTrump takes the stage in Mosinee to a soundtrack of "God Bless the USA."
if the #magabomber was not motivated by @realDonaldTrump then why are only his political enemies being targeted? we are reaping exactly what was sown by this bastard on our behalf. I guess we deserve the terror that's about to be unleashed across this country pic.twitter.com/UB052t0kSE
