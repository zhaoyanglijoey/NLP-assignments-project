@realDonaldTrump Why not employ veterans to protect schools? Kill two birds with one stone. Improve employment and make schools safe?
Truth is, @realDonaldTrump , that while Russia launched their anti-US campaign in 2014 BEFORE your announcement, you formed your Presidential campaign exploratory committee in 2013. They knew you were running. As to collusion: More indictments to come.

@realDonaldTrump is playing the democrats so well that I'm almost convinced he invented time travel so he could come back in time to save America from a horrible fate.
Sounds like a 'win, win, win, win'! For real - the country comes out a winner, along with the immigrants that make it stronger, more diverse and better all around, and @realDonaldTrump & @GOP 'reap what they sow' - JUSTICE!
. @realDonaldTrump Any DACA deal needs to help American workers, but the White House proposal delays the relief for at least 15 years. Please support H.R. 4760 instead!! #KeepYourPromise
Way over blown this was about getting @realDonaldTrump and less about true Russia meddling.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump doesn't have to collude with Russians. They needed an idiot to play and he fell into place. Right person at the right time. We all know @realDonaldTrump isn't smart enough to collude. The Russians played him, and they played him well. Americans were fooled

@realDonaldTrump I want to know all about the Clinton FDN,33,000 emails,server etc what is Mueller investigation on so we got 13 Russians for crimes they will never serve this is what Mueller also what did Obama do about these Russians nothing
@realDonaldTrump Smoke screen will not work, Do what you said you'd do. Mueller has sought an interview with Trump in the investigation. Trump has said that he would be open to sitting down with the special counsel, but that the final decision would be made by his attorneys. Bull

To all Trump supporters--how are you feeling about @realDonaldTrump denials of Russian interference in the US election today? You must be devastated by the overwhelming evidence in the indictments that contradict your man's position. And this is only the tip of the iceberg.
@realDonaldTrump is screwed

Benedict @realDonaldTrump can think whatever delusional thoughts that these indictments vindicates his fat ass, but this is only the beginning. Mueller's crossing every T and dotting every I so when he indicts the Dotard there's no getting away from it.
@realDonaldTrump I can't believe that I forgot to message you! You're a useless, traitorous fuckshit. I hope you end up in prison. I hope you spend your twilight years in solitary, slowly going mad. Fuck you very much.
