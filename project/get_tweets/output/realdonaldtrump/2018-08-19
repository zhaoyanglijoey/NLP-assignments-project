Hey @tedcruz If a nobody like me can stand up to Socialist Democrats you should be able to as well. I will vote for you but I expect you to get 100% on the @realDonaldTrump train..!
Its the same reason more Americans approve of Trump than Obama as of last week! America supports @realDonaldTrump !! And is growing past 51% ! Obamas was 42 ! August 2018 !
If only @realDonaldTrump had read THIS BOOK before deciding to run...

@realDonaldTrump I never would have thought the American people would have to protect themselves from the President of the United States. Unfortunately that's where we are as a country. We need to decide what kind of country we want to live in

President @realDonaldTrump demand for Turkey to release Andrew Brunson is wrong. Unless he is ready to release Maria Butina to Russia. Stay out of other nations judicial systems. By the way I support President Trump on most issues but not a blind 100%

@realDonaldTrump How about a new government program to purchase one-way tickets for any socialist wanting to renounce their US citizenship and move to Scandinavia, Venezuela, Italy, Greece, or Portugal?
But of course he doesn't think #POTUS @realDonaldTrump has crossed any lines. My party has become a joke! Country over party people!

Send me proof that @realDonaldTrump became the swamp, send me proof how he is hurting this country. Most folks don't like the way Trump talks and I don't all the time but there is no way you can prove that he is the swamp, quit listening to the MSM.

Nobody spells like @realDonaldTrump . He is above the rules of grammar and decency.
Treason would be colluding with a foreign power to subvert our democracy <cough cough> Donald @realDonaldTrump
Dear @realDonaldTrump i noticed you like to divert attention from this investigation by doing something crazy. I have a small suggestion for you to really take this heat off of you. Make marijuana legal, federally. That will really show Obama.
Almost time for @SharknadoSYFY 6 ! Just for a brief time we can put @realDonaldTrump aside & tune into real campy tv!
Someone close to @realDonaldTrump should tell him he's not #Putin , and we're not #Russians ! #JohnBrennan is a #Patriot . #Democracy #CountryOverParty #TruthIsTruth #Treason #IllegitimatePresident #TruthIsntTruth #FakePresident #Omarosa #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #Register & #Vote pic.twitter.com/PMDPy50QrK
This guy, Michael, from Nigeria (internet scam capital of the works) looks to @realDonaldTrump (con man of the Free World) as a mentor. And his goal is to be a major businessman in the U.S. If Angela wasn't a reality show maven I would tell her how wrong this is #BeforeThe90Days
@realDonaldTrump Donnie, why don't you watch MSNBC? Well know Pulitzer Prize winning historian speaking on McCarthyism. Now he is "smart".

All the more reason why all those opposing @GOP and @realDonaldTrump need to show up in November in massive, incontrovertible numbers.
If you were married to @realDonaldTrump like @FLOTUS is & ocassionaly had to fvck him, wouldn't you look peculiar?
It's very frustrating because I want to share the truth with people. They are being kept in a bubble and denied the truth. @realDonaldTrump should go to a free speech platform. Thank you! Am sorry to hear that it's happening to anyone.

Saw @kelliwardaz on @MSNBC today. She appears to be a good candidate to be more of a FUCKING MORON than @realDonaldTrump . Arizona can do better than a feckless Trunt like her.
We all know that you are hired by Putin and that you work for the KGB, we're just waiting on this investigation to be finished and for you to be arrested! @realDonaldTrump
You know, Jeanine, I think there is confusion in your tweet as to who is panicking. Check out the tweets of your friend @realDonaldTrump over the last 2 weeks. Pretty telling.
@realDonaldTrump Let's talk Promises. Kept: Tax cuts, de-regulate(partial) Not Kept: Build wall, drain swamp, Obama care, eliminate natl. debt, maga (whatever that is)... So here's my promise to you. I WILL NOT VOTE FOR ANY REBUBLICAN- EVER!

Also not normal: "I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn't have to." #Unhinged #Unfit #Unchosen @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump (a.k.a. Agent Orange) is spending so much time deflecting from scandals and attacking people unnecessarily that he has no time to actually be a president! He has divided our nation rather than united it. What a disappointment!
@NICKIMINAJ is starting to be just as annoying as @realDonaldTrump
Damn straight Bill!!! That is why we voted for @realDonaldTrump . We have had it with these lying, leaching, self serving politicians. We are done with them. Friggin #MAGA

The reason @realDonaldTrump really hates President Barack Obama is because Obama is infinitely a better man and a better President than Trump could ever be.

@realDonaldTrump this is horrible.
@charliekirk11 @RyanAFournier Should @SecNielsen and @realDonaldTrump request @SenateMajLdr @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan @Jim_Jordan and all in Congress to write a bill that would ban Sanctuary Cities forever since States shouldn't be allowed to threaten safety by breaking fed laws?
Any comment @realDonaldTrump
Hey Joe now I truly believe @realDonaldTrump is an amazing man. If he's not well and turning our country around with one hand tied behind his back. Even not 100% Trump still better than that Harvard educated socialism loving Obama. But like most of you crap it's lies.
Is he the token black who sold his soul to support Trump? Probably @realDonaldTrump asking Fuckabee Saunders who the n****r on CNN is
Those people saying the media deserves it are just another example of what's wrong with this country. A free press is a cornerstone of our republic, and @realDonaldTrump is wrong for betraying one of the founding principles of the country he leads
Bernie truly cares about the poor and middle class, he is the antithesis of @realDonaldTrump
The President, and all officers of the United States, does not have freedom of speech. Stating something that influences current cases, for example, is an unlawful abuse of power, an abuse of authority. @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump is a fucktard. So are all his imbecilic followers.
On the other hand, the top 1% & rich corporations, @realDonaldTrump 's included, got a 14% permanent tax cut worth hundreds of millions a year. A $7.25/hr minimum wage for working Americans Vs a $7,400/hr CEO salary! Maybe that's the 'people' Mick is talking about! pic.twitter.com/H0UQzJuMpH

@realDonaldTrump promised Mexico would pay for the wall. Why is he trying to get the USA to pay? Does he know the difference? Does he care? He also promised to show his taxes if he won. #UnfitToBePresident #GOPComplicit
They aren't better off now... Didn't they just lose their dental care? And some fat cats making #Veterans admin decisions.Spend the 'Space Farce' or EGO PARADE money on them. @realDonaldTrump 's fake concern for #vets dies in the hypocrisy of his actions. SHAMEFUL #VoteThemOut

May the days, weeks, hours, and minutes ahead be ever increasingly excruciating, fear inducing, and humiliating for @realDonaldTrump his family, friends, lawyers, the entire administration, #Republicans and the @gop as a whole. #TickTock

Hey @realDonaldTrump , McGahn this morning and Cohen this evening, both broken by the New York Times. Fake news, huh Asshole? You are going to prison, you treasonous clown! Get ready to grab your ankles. The boys in General Population are gonna love you!
Last time pictures like these were broadcast, @realDonaldTrump got so upset he ordered an attack on the murderer (Syria). I wonder why there is no reaction this time? Humm, could it be because he's assisting the murderers of the children and selling them the bombs this time?
WHY ? is #KelliWard using a #YEAROLD #Distorted #Tweets and #Mailers by #Hannity and @realDonaldTrump ? It will be what it is #GOP #AZReublicans will no doubt #Vote #TrumpEndorsement . #MarthaMcSally also has #OLD sound #Clips . @WootieWoot69
Dr Kelli Ward forgot to mention that @realDonaldTrump and the GOP hiked our debt by $1.4 T Guess she forgot about that or doesn't care we go further IN DEBT!! #KasieDC
They truly define @realDonaldTrump opposition. I hope the world is watching.
Maybe he like Dogs just fine but they take a lot of time and work and right now @realDonaldTrump is dedicating his time to #MAGA .
