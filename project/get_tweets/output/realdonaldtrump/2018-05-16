Uh there is no constitutional protection of discrimination due to political views. @seanhannity @rushlimbaugh @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you refer to people as animals. In doing so you are perpetuating an evil that adds to the misery and violence of this world. You have done nothing to promote goodness, only evil. You disgrace us. Your most patriotic act you can perform is to resign.
@realDonaldTrump Make America great again, resign!!! The Universe would be absolutely happy and in peace!!! Thank you
OMG WTF is wrong with @realDonaldTrump . Does he know that this nation has been built by immigrants? Just like his mom #WakeUpAmerica #ImpeachTrump #impeachment
Mafia boss @realDonaldTrump and his henchmen and women in @DHSgov and @ICEgov were fabricating claims without any basis today. Californians overwhelmingly oppose the militarization of border police and this idiotic wall the wannabe Fuhrer wants to build.
Donald, don't fire Mueller because he is the only one who can clear your name, at this point. The more you smear him, the more there is a cloud on your innocence. Okay? @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani
Tell us how to do it too! #Qanon #MAGA #TheGreatAwakening #WWG1WGA #WWGOWGA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne
You are a liar. Mitchell @realDonaldTrump called MS-13 animals. Which they are.

On Yanni/Laurel thing. Anybody who says Laurel is clearly FAKE NEWS! @realDonaldTrump
They can't. @realDonaldTrump is juggling them in his hands; because he has nasty dirt on each and everyone of them. I'm sorry Evangelists, it ain't the end of the World, just the end of Corruption. Hopefully.

That's crazy. We need to pass a bill to change this. Maybe this is why @realDonaldTrump blatley selling America's International policy. Certainly he could be charged with treason. The ZTE/China loan to Trump's business 1/2 billion $ is an act of treason.
@RudyGiuliani just acknowledged that @realDonaldTrump is GUILTY of crimes in the Russian investigation! Rudy wouldn't be telling us that Mueller said he can't indict Trump while he's still president ... if Trump WASN'T guilty! #Trump2020 #MAGA2020 https:// cnn.it/2rNxHc6

By now any reasonable person knows the Russian collusion crap just doesn't get it as far as with @realDonaldTrump , but you are right there was Russian collusion but it was with Hillary and the Democrats
@codeofvets @PPDNews @realDonaldTrump And an additional 40% are cowed to admit they do too.
So, apparently, you can't indict a sitting president. Maybe @realDonaldTrump became president to avoid prison
@realDonaldTrump I know the comparisons to Hitler are pretty common, but dehumanizing an entire class if people is exactly what Hitler did to the Jews. Congratulations, youre an actual Nazi now.
Yuge news @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ! Your lies are starting to catch up with you!!! #LiarInChief #TrumpCrimeFamily
What about the @HillaryClinton campaign PAYING to have unverified and untrue dirt @realDonaldTrump dug up? Your hypocrisy is beginning to show Jake. If Trump had been treated fairly by media, people would be more willing to see what he really is. Your unbalanced news helps him.

@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr Trump,I have much respect for you,but please repent from your way,God will forgive you, and you and a lot of people will go to Heaven
You're intentionally trying to thwart the rule of law. You, nor the Congress, has any say in this matter. You're merely trying to gather evidence to fwd to @POTUS , a la @RepDevinNunes . You care more about @realDonaldTrump than you do your country.
@MSNBC Depending on how bad this is, I don't feel safe with @realDonaldTrump in power. ( I don't feel safe anyway). But he should not remain in office if they find conspiracy and treason. He's capable of anything.
Every one of them stinks. @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @MELANIATRUMP @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr

@realDonaldTrump Do you realize what you are saying BEFORE it comes out of your pie hole?? TRUMP IS INTO BEASTIALITY!! HE IS MARRIED TO AN ANIMAL!! What kind of animal is your wife? A crazy one for sure!!
I can't figure that out. I even went to an @realDonaldTrump tweet and found no MAGAs in the comments to pick on.
Man I'm really perplexed. I mean, the whole world knows it, they've broken dozens of UN regulations, & now they have the backing of a renowned madman ( @realDonaldTrump ) who'd prolly even be manipulated by Forrest Gump What exactly is the purpose of @UN if not to stop this?!

The crimes of @realDonaldTrump are so significant and far reaching that Mueller should bring indictments and let the Supreme Court settle the issue. This is likely worse than the Founding Fathers ever envisioned. #MuellerInvestigation
