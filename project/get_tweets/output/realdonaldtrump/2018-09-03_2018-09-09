@realDonaldTrump You should look in the mirror, or at a video of yourself. Your mouth looks EXACTLY like an ass hole. Very fitting!!!!
Trump blasts Sessions over GOP congressmen indictments @CNNPolitics https:// cnn.it/2Q4Ak4L UNDER @realDonaldTrump , 13 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud and making false statements are OK. ALSO using campaign funds for personal use, falsifying records are OK.
Amen. And thank God for @realDonaldTrump
True. Do you think @realdonaldtrump is trying to change people's opinions of him (persuasion) or simply appealing to his base?
@realDonaldTrump you need to hire Alan Dershowitz

Man don't nobody take this clown @realDonaldTrump serious. Probability is they (Putin) are working together any damn way!
Think Colen Kaepernick and his kneeling. Even the Director was for leaving the flag out of the information. Knowing where Damien Chazelle (the director) is from helps understanding he's a mad DemocRAT, a chop at @realDonaldTrump using the picture.
@realDonaldTrump proving he's no stable genius.
@realDonaldTrump I feel like some American States are bleeding financially by a thousand Corrupt Politicians cuts. Draining our Financial blood! (STATE/ &Fed taxes if they can get it!! ) Fed Workers Also, Like Hud @SecretaryCarson 'Found' $500 Billion a Stash a while back?
@realDonaldTrump can you just strip the NFL of THIER non profit tax exempt status? It's b.s. anyway

@realDonaldTrump has proven to be the worst, most incompetent, dangerous and petulant POTUS in history, period...FULL STOP! @GOP & @HouseGOP are complicit and totally worthless! I applaud this person for sounding the alarm! We're in danger!!
Now I know you don't know what you are talking about. They are not under investigation. @realDonaldTrump is. Why do you think he is under investigation? You are a traitor supporting a traitor. It's that simple.
@realdonaldtrump . Not that you'd understand but for your education. "To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker."Frederick Douglass. Remember learning a little about him? Last year? Yea. That was nice.

hard to tell whether @realDonaldTrump is stupid enough to believe, knows his supporters are stupid enough to believe it, or simple so insecure he has to put forward this absurd and transparent lie
@realDonaldTrump Isn't it a shame someone can buy a building, charge people tens of thousands of dollars to attend, call it a university, and teach them nothing?

@realDonaldTrump I leaked the op-ed to the @nytimes I forgot, you don't have any black Sr. staffers
Watching @realDonaldTrump go absolutely bananas insane crazy the past couple days is both very entertaining and horrifyingly sad for the long term outlook for the country./ So gross that, as a nation, we've been reduced to this. #NYTimes #Pence #KavanaughHearings #SCOTUS #25th
Commander Queeg @realDonaldTrump is at it again!
No @realDonaldTrump , the press, under the 1st Amendment to Our Constitution has the right to protect their sources. You really should try reading the United States Constitution or have someone read it to you. You just might learn something, or not! #SAD
As am I! And more so than ever now that @realDonaldTrump decided he would go off the cliff & announce he would like to make it illegal to #Protest . Making it official that he is willing to #TakeApartTheConstitution & #DenyAmericansRights afforded therein. Veterans defend rights.
The book is a lie. And the American people who stand for America know it. They're trying to isolate @realdonaldtrump . They can't isolate 63+m Americans from him MAGA VoteRed2018
@realDonaldTrump the Trump presidency is Unraveling like a cheap sweater Fun to watch!!!!
What @realDonaldTrump needs to immediately do is polygraph his immediate circle to see if anyone gave info to the @nytimes .
@realDonaldTrump the Senior Administrative Official has staged a coup and must invoke the 25th Amendment or prolong a Constitutional Crisis and cause a National Security Crisis. What are the Chinese and the Russians doing. How are our allies behaving now. What will the Markets do

@realDonaldTrump is an unruly child. Even though his turn is over he refuses to give up the @Nintendo controller. He will destroy the system so nobody else can enjoy it before he is forcefully removed and placed in time out. #timesup #TickTock

To be clear, I have full respect for the POTUS. You probably noticed that my critical posts refer to @realDonaldTrump that's because I dislike #LyingTrump the aspiring #dictator . Trump doesn't deserve being called POTUS. This narcissist hasn't proven that he's up to the standards
@PressSec Sarah, you just described @realDonaldTrump ! #TimeToEnactAmendment25 .

@realDonaldTrump save the government some money and outsource USPS services to Fedex or UPS since the USPS chooses not to deliver our mail or packages. They are losing $$ yearly. Ups and Fedex loves to deliver my packages
He could just be a drunk. @realDonaldTrump lies about everything else. Why not that?

@realdonaldtrump Sir, you do not respect the flag, the National Anthem, the Country, or the Constitution....
@realdonaldtrump the president's job is, in part, to keep the government functioning properly, not to shut it down for his/her own political advantage or malignant toddler tantrums. If you can't abide by that simple standard, then feel free to STEP DOWN.

@realDonaldTrump Do you know your spiritual advisory board has been infiltrated by Jezebel? Vets for you
@realDonaldTrump Obama is out there campaigning and making efforts to cause more social unrest like he did for eight long ugly years with his preaching style race baiting. I know that with the exception of the low-IQ goers to his rallies the rest of America is really sick of him.
Of course. Hey @realDonaldTrump Fake candidate, Fake election, Fake inauguration, Fake rallies, Fake Presidency, Fake Diplomacy, Fake Congress ...will soon be defeated by ... Real Press, Real Voters, Real Democracy, Real Justice, Real Honor, Real Integrity, Real America
Don't feel bad ladies. My 82 year old mother voted Republican for the first time in her life and helped us elect President @realDonaldTrump . When I explained some of the differences in the parties, she said, "I guess I was always a Republican".
Why is @MichaelCohen212 asking for his money back from @StormyDaniels ? I thought the money belonged to @realDonaldTrump ? That is what the #MSM has been telling us.
Regarding @VP and his interview: Please remember, the American people DID NOT elect @realDonaldTrump ; rather, the electoral college did. #WeWereAlwaysGreat #DipshitDonald
@realDonaldTrump NO such thing as a private meeting anymore. Cannot trust anyone. Tell Mulvaney
It's ironic and silly that @BarackObama and the Democrats criticize @POTUS for not following precedent while Obama doesn't follow it by shutting up and letting @realDonaldTrump alone, like President Bush did for Obama. Also, Obama wants to go backwards, not forward like Trump
