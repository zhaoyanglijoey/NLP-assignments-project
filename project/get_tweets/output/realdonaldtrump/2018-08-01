@realDonaldTrump Was Manafort involved with removal of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko from office in favor of Manafort's buddy Viktor Yanukovych?

You know speaking of respect owed #JohnMcCain is owed an apology by @realDonaldTrump ; people have written off Don saying that McCain is not a hero because he was captured, I for one have not. We are honoring the long ago dead, I hope it brings some comfort to those left behind.
After 2 yrs of promoting false "racist-fascist-white supremacist-sexist-warmonger - collusion-unstable" narratives against @realDonaldTrump & supporters, Little Jim needs a safe space.

Mr Trump wouldn't be president if it wasn't for WikiLeaks and Julian. Would cement him as the greatest president in my lifetime if he gave Assange asylum & pardoned him. C'mon @realDonaldTrump do the right thing.
@SenSusanCollins wants to say @realDonaldTrump shouldnt be talking about the bullshit investigation at all, HELLO, THERE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE AN INVESTIGATION, WHEN is this REDICULOUS PHONY investigation going to end, and i NEED my ID everytime i go to the grocery store for cigs

@realDonaldTrump We can assume that the glut of Getty/Reuters of Melania approved photo images add into this amount; what's she up to now over $1 million? The gardening photo might have been mistake Sad! Holding pruners in wrong direction by the way. You kneel in dirt already!!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS oh, I'm sorry... I thought the @washingtonpost was "FAKE NEWS"?? THEN YOU CAN'T USE IT TO SUPPORT ANY OF YOUR POSITIONS, ASSHOLE.
Awesome!! It would be an honor to attend @realDonaldTrump rally's. #KAG

@realDonaldTrump Take a deep breath you have nothing to worry about. We are a country of laws. Manifort will be found innocent as he just forgot that $60 mil. from Russia. Your family, not a problem. You just didn't know. HAHAHA... they are coming and you can't stop them.
@Twitter @TwitterSupport fix my analytics. They are extremely delayed. Do I need message @realDonaldTrump in my group chat or the @CIA @FBI ... Same goes for @amazon
@realDonaldTrump Even if only these Korean War Vets we get I hope we get them all buy this should be all over our TV period they gave so much they deserve to have this moment for everyone to see.
I think the silly season is likely to reach the point of absurdity, given @realDonaldTrump 's recently-trending BS output.
When asked, @CNN executives refused to explain their shocking & shameful decision, refusing to cover the emotional return home of soldiers killed in the Korean War. @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @brianstelter @ChrisCuomo @CillizzaCNN @seanhannity @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson
@realDonaldTrump if elected Mr. President, I will push to see this ridiculous waste of tax payer money witch hunt conspiracy theory of the democrats so called Russia investigation brought to an end. Then the Democrat party will pay the people of the United States back every $!!!
@realDonaldTrump Regardless of what the fake news organizations are reporting, the educated American knows you are doing your best to put America first and make this a great country again but Democrats are against you on everything. I supported you and I will support you again
Every one of @realDonaldTrump actions help us map the weaknesses and gaps that exist in our 3 branch protections... #unamerican #healthcareForAll

Yes. Courage. THEY had the courage to stand up and be killed in the fight against an oppressive and authoritarian government in Korea. This is something you as well as @realDonaldTrump will never be able to grasp. They didn't die so YOU could roll over and become friends with NK.

@realDonaldTrump BS This Morning More Facebook fake accounts tied to Russia?
Our president @realDonaldTrump can take care of himself pretty well but all this noise has to be hard on #FLOTUS . Admire her poise in the face of the madness.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump there is an Einstein quote about doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results is insanity. Trump constantly lies and deflects and somehow expects sane Americans to believe him. Not going to happen Donnie boy.
There is no crime of "collusion" for you @realDonaldTrump in the same way, if I jumped into a pool naked, I couldn't be arrested for "skinny dipping": it isn't the correct word(s) for the crime, but the import is the same as the charge would be.

@realDonaldTrump wants to cut Russia slack on their sanctions when they are killing Ukrainians in a land grab. Turkey puts a Christian clergyman under house arrest and they come up with sanctions in less than a week. Has to keep his Bible-thumping base motivated . . .

@realDonaldTrump your approval rating has fallen 5% to 40%! Please, get out on the campaign trail in support of your Trump Candidates! We need your help to flip the Senate! The House is a forgone conclusion!
With your propensity to be CORRUPT, BIASED and POLITICAL, it is BEST you remain QUIET #JohnBrennan . You have left your #CIA in SHAME and it took @realDonaldTrump to finally EXPOSE your #DeepState DARK HEART that is sooooo un- #American !!! #Trump #MAGA #KAG pic.twitter.com/w6T6bJfvNJ
The President has commented constantly about Manafort, the trial, the judge (he loves T.S. Ellis), etc. The WH has then subsequently answered questions about Trump's comments. Amazing how much you're willing to overlook in your zeal for @realDonaldTrump .
wait, wait, wait. so @realDonaldTrump went in front of a crowd and said that if you want to buy groceries you need picture ID? and I missed it??

Is @VP . Allowed in a room with a female alone? Ask @realDonaldTrump . He loves It. Right @FLOTUS ? Oh. Not you. His next wife!!!
@realDonaldTrump clearly committed obstruction and he knows it. Which is why @PressSec lied for him.
With the help of @CLewandowski_ @Scavino45 @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @FLOTUS @GenFlynn and a small cast of others, he decided to make a real race of it. One thing you do not do is tell @realDonaldTrump that he can't do something. He will prove you wrong every time.
@realDonaldTrump is a stone-cold racist. He's proven this in deeds and words and many, many times. His father was even arrested at a Klan rally. Trump engaged in housing discrimination, went after innocent black men, and birthed the birther nonsense. He & his cultists are racists
So in conclusion let it be known now that our great president @realDonaldTrump does not support #qanon as implied by @PressSec . #TrustTRUMP #StableGenius
@realDonaldTrump what are your thoughts on Urban Meyer? #fakenews ?

When @realdonaldtrump makes a claim that is false, either he's unaware it's a falsehood or he knows its not true. One scenario is ignorance and the other is a lie. Please explain the difference between false and lie. Asking for a friend
@realDonaldTrump resign now. It's the only way to save face
They HAVE to. Trump is a one man wrecking ball. Nobody, particularly conservatives want to be on the wrong side of that Potus Twitter. Particularly when 90% of conservatives SUPPORT @realdonaldtrump
@CNN @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump WHAT? Would not show such a historic fallen HERO from the Korean war LIVE coverage ? THIS WAS HISTORIC!!! What ? You are so transparent CNN AND MSNBC! Wow! HOW DISRESPECTFUL AND HEARTLESS ! NO COVERAGE ON THIS! #CNN #MSNBC #FakeNewsMedia
Let them fight it out...... @realDonaldTrump would whoop his ass. ........Just saying
Hello there, @realDonaldTrump , you pissy-pants, foul-tempered Russian sock puppet halfwit: tweet about whatever distracting drivel you like. Your number is up, though and soon, you'll have nowhere to hide.
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/EFmHEmyqre
Rudy Giuliani says (repeating @realDonaldTrump ) that collusion is not a crime. Collusion is a conspiracy, and conspiracy against our democratic elections -- or laws our country has in place -- is definitely a crime! Saying there was no collusion is just word salad, in the end.
@realDonaldTrump
Things I bought at the grocery store today: Kombucha Klondike Bars (for the youngest monster) GoGurt (for the monsters) Cheese Fresh tortillas Nectarines @realDonaldTrump No ID was necessary. You are a fucking moron. Rex Tillerson was right about you.

@realDonaldTrump Y is Fox news the only one showing the Korean Wars Vets coming Home this should be on every channel what a disgrace they should be honored just for this one moment to recognize them can you all cover this moment
@realDonaldTrump Tiffany trump is the only trump kid w any sense. Trump rating is way down bc the pubs r leaving the sinking ship
@realDonaldTrump daily reminder that you're a massive twonk with the charisma and effectiveness of a sandpaper dildo
This Was Absolutely Awesome To Listen To Today. It Was Sheer Joy To Hear @realDonaldTrump Talk To Rush! https:// youtu.be/t2Oc27xNRoI
@TheDemocrats "What has @realDonaldTrump done? Nothing!" Except major improvements of the VA, Veteran's Choice which has helped many (including my friends) wounded Vets. Got NK under control. Brought the dead and hostages home. HIS JOB! Most complaints r that ain't his job
So, just so you understand what's happening here... 1. @realDonaldTrump being the ignorant moron that be is, launched HIS #TarriffTantrum against our closest Allies 2. Our Allies, of course, retaliated against Trump's absurd #Tarriffs 1/3
So @realDonaldTrump aka @POTUS now officially admits that #TrumpConspired ! #ImpeachTrumpNow
maybe you should quit your day job and consider being a comedian @realDonaldTrump
May be @realDonaldTrump should start telling #trimpsupporters what part of the news is fake. To b specific. When networks make mistakes they correct them publicly. Trump won't say b/c he knows Networks are correct otherwise he could sue them for libel.
@realDonaldTrump is NOT my President nor do I recognise his occupation. I do not recognise the laws of the United States at this time, nor will I comply with ANY efforts to search and/or seize my property. I will do everything in my power to disrupt this regime. #TheResistance

@PressSec believes @realDonaldTrump is bigger than everything else
@realDonaldTrump PRESIDENT Obama gets MILLIONS more likes than you Orange Dotard.
@realDonaldTrump says the "Fake News" is the "enemy of the people". At last night's rally he gestured to the reporters in the room and referred to them as "Fake News". This is, at a pure minimum, reckless endangerment of another person. A crime. Another crime. #NotMyPresident
Regarding @realDonaldTrump maybe @VanJones68 @AprilDRyan we should simply respect the fact! HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES the most powerful leader in the world of course he is persuasive negative or positive
Ummm, @realDonaldTrump does NOT pray. He believes only in himself.
Oh no! No one at WF or Publix or TJ has ever asked me for my ID. Have they been breaking the law all this time @realDonaldTrump ? Besides being a tremendous liar, you are a f%*king #moron . And @PressSec , your response was that he was referring to alcohol, was just pitiful.
Given that Judge Roberts is a Strict Constructionist, I don't believe that can happen. Then again, I never thought that @realDonaldTrump would win either. You never know... Maybe Putin has something on Judge Roberts too, and all bets are off.
@realDonaldTrump if you weren't such a traitor I'd call you a joke
