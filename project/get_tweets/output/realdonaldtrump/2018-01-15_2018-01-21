Donal J Trump is a RACIST LIAR. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump While you clumsily call other nations shitholes, a once rich neighbor is becoming one. Gonna act for Venezuela? Ur button?
@realDonaldTrump @GOP Previous Presidents have spent MLK day doing public service work. You had your fat ass dropped into one of your shithole golf clubs.
Celebrating today by reflecting on @realDonaldTrump first year. It's the lowest unemployment for African Americans in 45 years! Prison reform is being otw to help minorities get out and find jobs! MLK Jr park has been named a National Park! First ever by an African American!
Now this is how you do it. It's called being a real president that people are proud of... you could never get that many likes on any tweet unless you said you were resigning. @realDonaldTrump #BlueTsunami2018 #FakePresident pic.twitter.com/nvrXMaF2xa
#hatetrump @cnn @realDonaldTrump I don't get it, Trump is holding the dreamers hostage and the democrats are the ones with the money. The president is not supposed to be the bad guy right? He says Dems want drugs and all the bad stuff pouring in? I have only heard them say Daca
Good on @realDonaldTrump to pick a this MLK day to play golf. I love some golf but I gotta tell you it's a white, white sport. I know there's Tiger Woods but he was not the norm in the golfing world. #MLKDay
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @TomiLahren trump and the wife he ordered immigrants and the 5 white guys deciding the DACA outcome are immigrants. If you are not indigenous to this Continent you are an IMMIGRANT tomi lahren ancestors are living on Native homestead land in SD pic.twitter.com/tgpe8pmBHt
. @realDonaldTrump REAL news is always being reported b/c they always get it right! They promote a REAL book about a mentally deranged fake president, which is based off true information & facts. about how I cheated and rigged the election in my favor w/ Putin's & Russia's help!
No way this should be passed without knowledge of what @DevinNunes saw. What patriots will stand with you @tedcruz @TomCottonAR @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @GOP Seriously abuses during last election much bigger threat than Russia. Protect our rights or fail history
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should listen and take notes from President Reagan...
I do not believe @realDonaldTrump ever in intended to create a pathway to citizenship for DACA. He believes that there are only two types of immigrants; criminals and those that work for him. He has sabotaged solutions & forbidden the @GOP to find a solution.
@LavarMemes @ZO2_ @MagicJohnson @Lavarbigballer @BillWalton @Lakers @Soulforsoles @LakersReporter @RealMikeWilbon @realDonaldTrump #Thebestrookie .

Seeing GOP members, specifically @MikePenceVP @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan talk about MLK JR makes me me truly question if they know who the man was and what he did for this country and the world.
And yesss....MY @POTUS this is exactly why millions&millions of us put our hopes&dreams with you...and most importantly our VOTES. Plan to vote for @realDonaldTrump AGAIN!So proud of your policy America 1st!
This means he said it but everyone took it the wrong way! Lol What a piece of you are @realDonaldTrump ! You ARE a racist!
@realDonaldTrump we will let you in to the uk IF you bring @BarackObama with you and let him do all your meetings and public appearances as well basically let him do your job just better than you
As if @realDonaldTrump is capable of apologizing or taking blame for anything.
DAMN RIGHT @realDonaldTrump Dicky Durbin tried to snarl you into a DACA Deal - if you don't they will say you are racist -THEY HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU A RACIST SINCE 2015 - DO NOT GIVE IN
What happened from Hawaii, was CLEARLY another Knee Jerk Effort from BHO / Democrats to Test @realDonaldTrump !The Hawaiian Leaders, are being held hostage and must comply for money flow, or death, as the BHO/HRC are known to have happen, BHO "appointed Judge is a clue to events" pic.twitter.com/KHRBvqqPbX

@sternshow I actually now think that @realDonaldTrump actually works less than @HowardStern ! Didn't think anyone did.
@realDonaldTrump I do not want you to cave on a standalone DACA bill. That's what has happened for YEARS, Congress has had 4 months or longer to find a real solution and they simply refuse. CONGRESS as a whole must compromise and get a REAL bill.
@realDonaldTrump needs to deport them all so fast that MSM liars can't keep up!! Keep deporting them because we all know it is the only chance DEMS have to stay in power since American citizens do NOT support DEMS! #MAGA

So when @realDonaldTrump says "Believe Me.." we know to NOT believe a word coming out of his mouth. So when he says "I'm the least racist person you've ever interviewed..." I think you can see where this is going.... #LiarInChief
@NBCNightlyNews @CBSEveningNews @ABCWorldNews since everyone on this #MLKDay talks about @POTUS being a racist why not show the country (world) that the very neice of #MLK himself #AlvedaKing emphatically denies @realDonaldTrump is a racist. I think she is pretty credible. pic.twitter.com/v8If4siJl7
I would argue that Stalin was less maniacal and more sociopathic. In that vein, I would argue that @realDonaldTrump is a sociopath, or at least flagrant self serving narcissist. In which case, he could, if he had the power, make similar decisions to Stalin.

Funny with @realDonaldTrump the left accuses him of things and that forces us to dig into his past to see if the accusations are true, and whenever we do that we learn more & more just how good of a guy he is. Like with Haiti, I didn't know he paid for 300 Haitians eye surgeries
@realDonaldTrump With all that is going on lately what are your views o. The US and Wakanda relations? How are their dignitaries and diplomates handling the issues the media keeps reporting on?

Because women are intelligent enough to know that using a social media platform to risk all life on Earth into nuclear war, as an excuse to threaten everyone to adhere to @RealDonaldTrump 's political agenda, is unwise and dangerous. #WomenDeliver
Love how you keep church and state matters separate. How many abortions do you think @realDonaldTrump has forced his mistresses to get in the past 50 years?

Mr. President @realDonaldTrump please I implore you do not allow yourself to be interviewed by Robert Mueller, it's a trap! It will not serve you well to do that, they will use your words to try to destroy you. You're doing a fantastic job and may God Bless You and protect you!
@realDonaldTrump your ratings are worse than @wolfblitzer
Spanked with a rolled up copy of Forbes - to borrow one of the president's favorite phrases - "like a dog"? Upon further reflection that $130K is starting to look like a bargain, @realDonaldTrump
Still no arrests? @realDonaldTrump
If the government is to shut down, IMO, it is very selfish and politicians are not thinking about the constituents who voted them in to represent them. They are only thinking about themselves and their own agendas. Put your hate for @realDonaldTrump aside and think about the ppl.
@realDonaldTrump I viewing the Brett Baier show 2nite (1/18/2018), Napolitano stated that you should NEVER sit down to be interviewed by Mueller. I agree. He is looking for any opportunity to trap you. Why Talk to them...? ''No'' lawyer would allow you to jeapordize yourself..!

@realDonaldTrump Hey, I discovered a way to rake in billions in extra tax revenue. Instead of spending millions on housing for inmates who have only non-violent, marijuana related charges, let them go. Want even more money? Decriminalize and legalize. Look at Colorado's economy!
#SchumerShutdown @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you made a deal with Pelosi and Schumer this last September to find a DACA solution. Then, you went back on your word. Are you a man of your word, or are you one with no conviction who can easily overruled by unelected "advisors"?
The US Senate - It is the real Washington DC Hole The is screwing America and putting the US in mortal danger by not funding the WALL and the US MILITARY to stand against world enemies @realDonaldTrump

#ReleaseTheDocuments crowd touts that #Democrat voters will be outraged & @DNC will be destroyed by #ReleaseTheMemo contents. But I wonder. Are the principles of the majority of #Democrat party members so much higher than their leaders'? As @realDonaldTrump says, we'll see
@realDonaldTrump is doing nothing to stop #GovermentShutdown . He said he would sign DACA, but that was a lie. He is just a terrible leader.

DACA plan @realDonaldTrump let the kids stay as long as all laws are followed. Any deviation,instant deportation. For the parents ...the wish of a better life for their kids achieved. They and chain can return and start legal process to return.

@realDonaldTrump If dem. vote no. what will they do if you pull ALL our military back home. if we have no military looking out for us. i bet they will vote to keep our military at work to protect them.
@realDonaldTrump and his brigade will likely get themselves thrown in jail prior to getting thrown in prison.
You gotta remember that when @realDonaldTrump says "contribute to society" he means "bring shitloads of cash." That's why his immigration "merit system" puts high emphasis on wealth.

How ironic that not only did the US government shut down on the one year anniversary of the @realDonaldTrump presidency, but with a republican majority in the house.
Nice try, dumdum, but no one is buying it. YOU and @realDonaldTrump are responsible for this mess. What a maroon.... #MitchLIES

@realDonaldTrump So they just made FISA worse and stronger! You have been a victim of FISA! Why would you allow them to do this? Did they bother to ask us? This is our country! Congress doesn't represent us! They just represent their pockets! Hypocrites!
@realDonaldTrump Please ban and take away ownership of media companies from those who are not natural-born US citizens.
So how is it fair that y'all will still be getting your paychecks but the people who fight for our country probably won't due to this government shutdown. @realDonaldTrump
Right...... So that 190,000$ from @realDonaldTrump to @StormyDaniels was for what then?
Imagine if President Shit-for-Brains spent his time trying to come up with a budget that could get 60 votes instead of his dumbass fake news awards show? @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump if Congress can't reach an agreement by the deadlines given to them, then why are they getting paid? Everyone else in the real world is reprimanded or fired when their job deadlines are not met.

@SenMajLdr Enough! You personally contributed for why there is a gov shutdown! This is on @realDonaldTrump , @SpeakerRyan the #GOP & YOU! You all refuse to work with @SenSchumer & the rest of Dems.Count your days because on election day WE ARE VOTING YOU OUT! #VOTE2018
Oh Steph, @realDonaldTrump does it every day, but with foul language about US Citizens. When a secretary lies to the senate, this is nothing. Prison is also possible.
They are trying to remake their base, as @realDonaldTrump is gaining the support of American workers from their party. Lots of ex-Dems now as the D party has abandoned any pretense of patriotism & embraces far Left ideology.
Along with @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Trump, please stand with the Greeks and defend their history, #MacedoniaIsGreek . Also, help Greece get rid of the radical Left and #Tsipras . Tsipras is the socialist scum who called you evil, attacked the Greek Orthodox church and admires Mao #SchumerShutdown

@realDonaldTrump The Democrat Party represents a clear and present danger to our democracy. You sow the seeds of hatred like Obama did....the Senate is dysfunctional. McConnell, end the filibuster NOW. #SchumerShutdown
Sure, then @realDonaldTrump deals with a broken promise, that Mexico pays for the wall #PantsOnFire
Trump's first year has felt a lot longer than one year. Trump is literally slowing time and allowing us to live longer. But you'll never see the fake liberal news media give @realDonaldTrump credit for that now will you!?
@realDonaldTrump will reverse that or pay out of his own pocket, sometime #Obama would never have done! #schumershutdown #releasethememo
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is such a dangerous policy. And it only serves to give massive incentive for illegal aliens to pour through the border, and even worse, it is like a neon sign that will draw scores of criminals and possible terrorists. #SupportICE #CloseTheBorder

@realDonaldTrump In all of my 36 years of running a restaurant, THE HARDEST WORKING PERSON that I ever hired was a DREAMer. Worked her ass off. And, she worked TWO 40-hour a week jobs. I am so over these people who do not know facts or have ever even known a DREAMer. #DreamActNow

WRONG, TRUE AMERICANS DON'T CARE ABOUT DREAMERS, WE CARE ABOUT OUR LEGAL AMERICAN CHILDREN. DREAMERS AND ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GO HOME! @maga @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @gop @FoxNews
Your thoughts are rational, @realDonaldTrump is ignorant & self centered.
@realDonaldTrump Even if the Senate sells out the people, please stay strong on the wall, ending chain migration, e-verify. As one of your supporters, I don't want any amnesty because it just keeps happening over and over again.

But that's still only about 10% of the #CluelessCheeto @realDonaldTrump 's Inauguration crowd, right? #DelusionalDonnie #WomensMarch2018
Hey @realDonaldTrump People are calling him President Kelly because he seems to be in charge and you are easily led by the nose. Weak and sad!
The ONLY reason I say MAY HAVE is that there is so much evil in our government and our country...time will tell if it's not too late. If not for @realDonaldTrump we would be in very poor shape. Thank God for him and We The People that voted for him.

Wouldn't it be a good thing to make the dreamers legal? They would need to pay a hefty fine or a fee if you want to call it. That could be used towards border patrol or border security, just a thought. You could even say @realDonaldTrump came up with that.
@realDonaldTrump Stick to your guns Mr President. The American people and our military will NOT be held hostage to illegal immigrants! Dems own this. Btw, if you wanted to support the Vikings tonight. They have stood for flag and anthem all year. Go Vikes!
