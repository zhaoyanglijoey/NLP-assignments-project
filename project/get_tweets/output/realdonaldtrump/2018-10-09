Same people that picked @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump just your friendly reminder that you're an utter piece of crap. Okay, that's it, you can go back to stuffing your face on a big mac.
@nikkihaley @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse and the rumors start and propaganda will spin out of control @PressSec
In a tweet, "this is war, time to fight". And in the video in the original tweet, @realDonaldTrump says it's time to defeat the democrats for good. He and his supporters are getting the Republicans ready for war against Americans
Obviously @realDonaldTrump was curious also because he just led a cheer calling out each state, and the Nebraska cheer was FAR louder than Iowa's.
Since the 'win' of the confirmation, "Republicans fight back now. @realDonaldTrump has changed the Republican Party significantly for the better. Democrats should be terrified" this was @XStrategiesDC tweet from earlier today. Also @DonaldJTrumpJr said
I love listening to President @realDonaldTrump There's always something new and brilliantly funny each rally. And some good things the same... #BuildTheWall #USA #LockHerUp "Her" is now encouraging violence. We should change too... #HangHerUp ( #HangHerUpUntilSHEDead )
What the actual fuck does Kanye or @realDonaldTrump know about any of these topics #pointless #sideshow
This is @realDonaldTrump 's #Merica ! Expect nothing less.

Two sources tell me that @realDonaldTrump staff was not happy with @IAGovernor Kim Reynolds response to NAFTA resolution. Thought it was not effusive enough and no thanks to Trump. Speaks to the fine line Reynolds is walking
Iowa and Nebraska love Trump!!! @realDonaldTrump
I dedicate this song just because to @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr and @VP and the entire @GOP gang of thugs n thieves. https:// youtu.be/yFE6qQ3ySXE
President Obama is so Beloved & Respected World Wide. @realDonaldTrump can't even go back to his hometown of New York without protests.
OMG! @HillaryClinton said democrats will only be civil if given POWER. Yep! Watch the news. She's a clueless old witch #tcot #gop @realDonaldTrump

GBR!!!!! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Donald, it really would be nice to see the WHOLE TRUMP FAMILY working in high political positions.
Right. Democrats have a mob mentality. These rallies are nothing but a rabid mob stirred up by @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President: If we don't build the wall, we will still have a country but it won't be called the USA. It will be called Europe!
LISTEN FOLKS PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump IS BULIDING THE WALL, BUT THE ONLY WAY HE CAN FINISH IT WE NEED MORE GOP SENATORS, VOTE RED #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2018
That is how @realDonaldTrump refers to reports because WH staff has to turn everything they want him to understand into a picture book.
@realDonaldTrump is outrageous, Ivanka is qualified to sell clothing and shoes not represent America at the UN.
Set aside the electoral malfeasance (foreign and domestic): What rapprochement could be reached with #Cult45 whose judgement found @realDonaldTrump fit to become #POTUS ?
The biggest applause of the night -- by far at @realDonaldTrump rally -- is when the president mentions "Nebraska." The dangers of any Council Bluffs rally. "I just want to see who the hell I'm speaking to!" Trump said.

@realDonaldTrump @BrettKavanaugh Loyal Americans know who and what you are. Nominated by a sex offender, confirmed by apologists for sexual offense, your are hated by more than half the country. TO US, YOU WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING MORE THAN SCOTUS' BASTARD PRINCELING! #KAVANAUGH pic.twitter.com/zGdWtGMQAf
Trump loves Nebraska. @realDonaldTrump
If you don't recognize that @realDonaldTrump and Brett #Kavanaugh suck and are douchebags, it's because you either were the douchebag in high school or you wanted to be them.
@realDonaldTrump Does @SenFeinstein and @NancyPelosi have walls around their mansions?
Whatever #Trump says is a projection. If . @realDonaldTrump says they're evil, it's because #Trump knows it is he who is #Evil .

@HillaryClinton vs @realDonaldTrump so let's see why this happened. We organized in low income areas that sadly had crime. So people got felonies and couldn't vote again. How here ya go again going the same shit. Lmfao fail x2 #maga2020

@realDonaldTrump you gave props to @FoxNews but @OANN is the network broadcasting you live from Iowa. Just saying. ;)
So, @nikkihaley got tired of defending the indefensible and maybe sprouted a conscience, and is resigning from the @realDonaldTrump @POTUS administration. Now we, and the rest of the world, brace to see what crackpot loyalist he'll nominate to replace her.
McConnell @senatemajldr called the protesters a mob, trump @realDonaldTrump claimed many were paid agitators. Maybe both should read the First Amendment. "; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
Nebraska Loves Trump! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump #DonaldTrump supporters are #cowards . They probably beat their wives or girlfriends or daughters. #MAGAT 's would consider that #manly . Brag to their friends how they have control over their woman. They do it because they fear us. Why, I don't know. #pinkwave

. @realDonaldTrump paid people to go to his rallies, and now he is projecting his deceptive behavior onto the Democrats. As usual, when he accuses Dems, it's a coverup for what he has done.

@realDonaldTrump Do not presume to apologize for me. What would be nice is if you apologized to me for what I have had to endure as an American.
All can happen with @realDonaldTrump !
Disappointed in @FoxNews . Was watching @marthamaccallum . Thought they would cut over to @realDonaldTrump #IowaRally . They did not. Tuning in to @OANN now! #MAGA
Everyone has a right to council Look up the law You people are a bunch of communists you leader @realDonaldTrump All his wife's came from communists controlled countries Look it up His inlaws are card carting commies just became citizen of the US By pass all US immigration laws
Remember when @realDonaldTrump wasn't the most corrupt person in the WH? I suppose that's rhetorical.

Ask @realDonaldTrump -- he gave one of them 130,000 up-votes.
@realDonaldTrump Sir Don, Simple question. Why wouldn't AG be directly involved in finding out if his DAG made statement about recording you & invoking the 25th to get rid of you? That direct duty does not interfere with ANY ongoing investigation. Does AG just quit & keep job?

@realDonaldTrump Protesting is a right protected by the first amendment. You know what is far more embarrassing than protestors? A fake President who stands in front of the nation and lies day after day. One who disparages more than 1/2 the nation daily. One who cheats. YOU

@realDonaldTrump Look at it? In Technology we have something called data driven decision making. You look at all the data. Not opinions but hard data. If somebody says the ice caps are melting then you can say "where did you get that data?" If they say from a probe in the artic.
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SenSchumer @senatemajldr all need to get together & condemn this as one united nation.
Dude, I don't usually join the tired & worn out game of "Whataboutism."

I suspect that in childhood, @realDonaldTrump often heard the words he's telling Kavanaugh: "I am so sorry the mean woman tried to tell you that it's wrong to do whatever you want to do. Of course, you can." Poor spoiled brats.

Talking about agriculture leaders who say they rely heavily on immigrant labor, @realDonaldTrump says, "We need people coming in. We need people to help run the farms. We're going to let people come in. But they're going to come in legally."
@realDonaldTrump Then, put Don Jr somewhere he can be better seen.
. @realDonaldTrump as @POTUS you MUST refuse to repay China loans to the USA. Their espionage with microchips is an act of war. They have stolen enough #intelligence and #intellectualproperty to make up for any monies they loaned the USA. cc: @WhiteHouse #NoChinaLoanPayments
@realDonaldTrump claimed Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Want to talk about low?
Not on behalf of me. I don't apologize for one second to a man unfit for the job he was given so Trump wouldn't have to face the consequences of his own actions. @realDonaldTrump You don't speak for me!

And yet you defend @realDonaldTrump the absolute king of poor grammar (and shitty governance, but I digress). So by your logic you are betraying your level of ignorance... Double so for defending Trump ;) (again digression).
THEY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH @realDonaldTrump ! He's running circles around every.fucking.body.
This is the actions of a scared @GOP that when Trump @realDonaldTrump attacks the press something will happen to you.
So, the #OED actually has a picture of @IvankaTrump in her official #WH capacity in its definition of #Nepotism . Only @realDonaldTrump has the chutzpah (which is Yiddish for "disconnected to reality") to act like it would be a purely personal attack on him to call this nepotism.
You, #BrettKavanaugh , were NOT PRIVEN innocent and for @realDonaldTrump to utter those words is an outright lie...although, what else should we expect from #trump and this administration? Certainly not ethical behavior.
They showed a pattern of behavior. Supposed journalist willingness to let nothing stand in the way of attacking @realDonaldTrump and everything he does.
