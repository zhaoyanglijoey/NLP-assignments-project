@realDonaldTrump Please tell Jeff Sessions to stay out of states business that have past cannabis legalization, especially medicinal usage. I think that was one of your campaign promises. Thanks in advance.

If @realDonaldTrump sues @SteveKBannon , doesn't that open him up to a discovery process? I don't know how all this works in detail, but it seems highly likely this is nothing but a publicity stunt by #POTUS . I really wish we could get around to, you know, important stuff.
