@realDonaldTrump This is on you, You need to tone down your hatred toward the Democrats and the media. It is you, you are the one that is suppose to set a higher standard for people. You sir are a spreader of hate.
I wish It'd be that easy. #trump #MAGABomber #LiarInChief @realDonaldTrump @ChicagoCityDSA @DemSocialists pic.twitter.com/TeVAZJyjDk
Anyone who thinks @realDonaldTrump is not responsible for the bomb threats is Smoking Dope! #CesarSayoc list comes directly from #Trump @CNN , @JohnBrennan @HillaryClinton name ONE thing on that list that he hasn't expressed a dislike for?? #DogWhistles make dogs bark! #Duh
False flag? LOLOL. You know we've actually been to the Moon right? And you can't fall off the edge of the #FlatEarth ? @realDonaldTrump @rushlimbaugh hahahaha. Eat shit douchebags. #opioid #microphallus
@realDonaldTrump and his #maga cultists need to be classified as a terror organization.
OK, since @realDonaldTrump has put himself on the ballot, there is only one thing to do..... #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2018 #BlueWave #TheResistance
@RepMarkWalker . Enough! It is time to call @realDonaldTrump out! Your defense of the indefensible is pathetic. Do. Your. Job.
What is it with @realDonaldTrump and adult entertainers? #SerialBomber
to bad maybe they should have thought abt their healthcare needs before helping to get Trumps lying ass elected to office they went for the con when @realDonaldTrump claimed he was gonna cover everyone with great great health insurance that is until he actually got in office
You, your party and Especially @realDonaldTrump fueled his hate! You lied, called democrat women names, mocked Clinton, Obama. Bashed the media and bullied. He praised violence at his hateful, inciteful kkk rallies! You people are a disgrace and a stain in American history!
Cesar Sayoc Jr., Alleged Mail Bomber, Threatened Democrats on Twitter https:// thebea.st/2OVdXlm ? source=twitter&via=desktop via @thedailybeast And he's a stripper. We all know @realdonaldtrump likes strippers. #themoreyouknow
@realDonaldTrump I think you need to tone down your tanning spray! Looking a bit orange Donnie! The truth is you have not toned down! Your tweets and rallies prove it! The media has nothing to do with it! Your written words and videos of your rallies show the truth! No respect! pic.twitter.com/DuD4IvYwBh
@realDonaldTrump BREAKING! PROOF OF DEEP STATE HOAX! Clapper Talks About Cesar Sayoc Befo... https:// youtu.be/2ZSEhGT3U-U via @YouTube
@realDonaldTrump @potus @JudgeKavanaugh @USSupremeCourt family law reform? Title IVd?
Hey @tedcruz remember when @realDonaldTrump talked trash about your wife and your dad. Is it painful having to pretend you like him? #savage
@realDonaldTrump when you point a finger, there are 3 fingers pointing back at you...everything you have said about media and bombings applies to you...you are are the arsonist in this bomb stuff
So we're only about 15 minutes into Charmed and I've already caught two stabs at @realDonaldTrump and I'm living for it.
Amazing @FoxNews moment Shep blames @realDonaldTrump and Chris Wallace calls him on it and Shep denies he said it. Shows how much hatred Shep has for DJT.
@nytimes Why aren't you running article after article about @realDonaldTrump 's phone. THIS IS A MAJOR STORY. REPORT ON IT LIKE YOU DID ON HILLARY'S EMAILS
I'm sure there'd be people saying that about @HillaryClinton if she had won in 2016. She isn't exactly great. @realDonaldTrump is WAY more worth the vote than Hillary "I told Bill Clinton's accuser to shut up " Clinton.
So this is the GRAND VIEW .. where I help people!! All while on break watching the news as people are out their killing each other. #STUPIDHUMANS @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/m4uPagXwDO
@realDonaldTrump FUCK YOU DONALD TRUMP. FUCK YOUR PINK ASS
@realDonaldTrump What's it like living as a cowardly fraud?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @Hannity @TuckerCarlson This is fantastic!!!!
Anyone who thinks @realDonaldTrump is not responsible for the bomb threats is Smoking Dope! #CesarSayoc list comes directly from #Trump @CNN , @JohnBrennan @HillaryClinton name ONE thing on that list that he hasn't expressed a dislike for?? #DogWhistles make dogs bark! #Duh
"I have many many friends who are bad people." @realDonaldTrump FINALLY speaks a #Truth ! I wonder if it violates his deal with the devil? #GodHelpUsAll #VoteBlue #TheWorldIsWatching #HistoryWillJudgeUs #TrumpRallyCharlotte #MakingAmericaStupidAgain
To the #TrumpAllies in the @GOP , @HouseGOP , & @SenateGOP , it's become quite obvious that @realDonaldTrump 's supporters possibly have in their midst people just like the #MAGABomber Cesar Sayoc. Is that what you want to be associated w/? Do you want to be the party of Trumpism?
Or @realDonaldTrump ... pic.twitter.com/e90IeknHfd
Oh I must have done something right cuz I got blocked by @realDonaldTrump ...I guess truth telling pisses him off
Somehow, also the fault of @realDonaldTrump !
And would vote for you and your colleagues cuz this constitutes part of the base that @realDonaldTrump is referencing and talking in code to when he says he's a nationalist(racist)
@realDonaldTrump MAGA; The greatest President ever!!!!
@realDonaldTrump only reason the media is to blame is they broadcast your pathetic rants & craziness. You want to see the culprit that started the fire look in the mirror ..
@realDonaldTrump President Trump , if you need more soldiers to go to the borders ,please call on our veterans. I am ready to serve my country again . thank you
No @realDonaldTrump is referring to himself.
Our #media must accept responsibility for its #BadReputation , which is not due to @realDonaldTrump but to the media's #scapegoatism & obnoxious, #disrespectful behavior. Like spoiled #brats , they whine & blame the President when THEY are at fault, starting w/ @CNN . pic.twitter.com/Eq77WRTVtU
Closer invaders come, fewer women & children in pics. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump should order pamphlets in several Central American & Middle Eastern languages dropped declaring caravan invasion act of war & warn invasion will be dealt w/ any force necessary, including deadly force
@realDonaldTrump has only been screaming that he has the IQ of a bag of dildos for DECADES
@realDonaldTrump is GUILTY of inciting hatred and violence @SouthernDems_ @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateGOP @senatemajldr @MMFlint @CNN @CNN @DearAuntCrabby @naretevduorp @NPR @PressSec @joncoopertweets @funder @DFJacquie @marwablue @RollingStone @MotherJones
So when is the apology, Lyin' Donnie? Video shows MAGABomber at 2017 Trump rally @CNN https:// cnn.it/2Jh5lz8 @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump You, sir, are a rotting piece of meat and your flies can't get enough. But there is sweeter nectar they should turn to for real nourishment and happiness. Rot begets rot and is, quite frankly, deplorable. But we all knew that already.
Just wondering where is #mrcricket today @LindseyGrahamSC and @realDonaldTrump lackey @SpeakerRyan on this #madbomber #crickets #sosad hope everybody realizes what they truly are #partybeforecountry . #lindseybetrayedMccain #BlueWaveComing
@realDonaldTrump Love this! pic.twitter.com/XzDfbti3cn
Sara, this censorship has been happening since Alex Jones was banned online by Apple, Facebook, Twitter, PayPal, etc - #Technocrats hate conservative voices, America and God.

https:// youtu.be/kNrj87Q-4Yk I really don't know what I have to do to get Barbara Streisand's protest song trending. There are millions of people who dislike @realDonaldTrump as much as l do If you give it a chance and like the lyrics and the song please will you re-tweet it
I don't understand why congress can't come up with money for the wall but Obama came up with 150 billion dollars cash for Iran. @realDonaldTrump
Hey @realDonaldTrump , please shut the fuck up.
I wonder how notorious Trump hater @mjfree feels about the Conservative Young Black Leadership Summit? @realDonaldTrump isn't a racist, and his supporters prove it! #MAGA #YBLS2018
The good news is that GOP will win super majority in both houses in November 2018. Then Trump can clean house I DOJ!! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @GOP
"Negative attacks" = @realDonaldTrump 's feeling that it's not fair that the media airs video of him saying so many hateful and/or idiotic things. Truth hurts, asshole.
#VoteRedToSaveAmerica We The People support President Donald Trump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #VoteRedToSaveAmerica pic.twitter.com/db9Gcz8k5q
Do you think that @realDonaldTrump arranged this and that is why Cruz is kissing him on the lips?
@realDonaldTrump is raising wages by tax breaks & reducing barriers. You have clearly said #Dems are against this! You have no plsn
@realScottWagner you are unhinged and unfit to be governor or even human. Disgusting that you promote violence against Tom Wolf. You are a @realDonaldTrump flunkie
Love our President!!! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS pic.twitter.com/ga9FiiV6aE
Would like to hear you @RickSantorum stand up and say that the targets the bomber chose aren't common threaded by @realDonaldTrump rhetoric.
@realDonaldTrump you can't unify people if you can't admit your part in tearing the unity apart. You have to be a big enough man to admit that and YOUR NOT!
Yes, definitely. It's time. I'll go step further. @realDonaldTrump 's unfit to be President of the United States of America. Trump's blaming media again tonight at rally in NC. Still hasn't reached out to intended victims of #MAGAbomber . No concept of job of POTUS. Independent
Dear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump could you please come to Albuquerque for a rally. I will be in attendance if you do with my Trump hat on.
Islam doesn't radicalize people, individuals do. You can support Islam and not support the individuals that misinterpret it. @realDonaldTrump directly radicalizes people through his words and actions. You cannot support him and his power with the same absolution.
@realDonaldTrump STOP BEING A COWARD AND SISSY. WE ARE TIRED OF YOUR SHIT. YOU ARE ASKING FOR TROUBLE YOU FUCKIN BASTARD. SOMEONE NEEDS TO ACT AGAINST THIS HITLER. VOTE DEMOCRAT!!!
This is ridiculous, just because we support @realDonaldTrump we get our accounts suspended, nothing wrong just because all my twits are Pro- Trump they lock my account, this is scary we are in the hands of a left socialist campaign, is enough to go through this!!! pic.twitter.com/x3acASG7dY
@SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump So when the terrorist car is covered in support for trump, red X's over targets faces, how will you spin this to the Democrats? I ask because I know you will never take responsibility for your words influencing him. You cant be adults
what's most surprising is not that @realdonaldtrump 's rhetoric incited violence, but that it happened in such a classic way- Trump supporter, old white guy with anger issues
#fakingbumber - quick see this!!! @loudobbs , @kennedynation , @ingrahamangle , @tuckercarlson , @foxandfriends , @realdonaldtrump , @sebgorka @danaperino https:// prnt.sc/laykfa via @light_shot screen shot shows bomber was dem - being suppressed!
Watching @realDonaldTrump #Rally on C.SPAN2 @cspan
Watch the Rally on @OANN Directv channel 347 #MAGA . No kook will stop us from voting for @realDonaldTrump supporters. Those receiving packages were those who VOCALLY CALLED FOR violence against Trump family-GOP
@realDonaldTrump You incite violence, you get violence. You keep opening your big mouth, you should be held accountable, and charged on felony charges.
Does anyone else ever cast spells on @realDonaldTrump ?
#MAGA #BuildTheWall #DrainTheSwamp This is the winning ticket for the GOP ! Enough said @realDonaldTrump #USA
When will @realDonaldTrump question whether the arrested bomber is a real Native American or ask if he's related to @SenWarren ? #MAGABomber
Republicans inciting others to violence, like Trump does now, is not new...! @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/yR8wu0DolC
@realDonaldTrump YOU RIGHT NOW THIS WEEK TOOK THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FROM OBAMA CARE? YOU&GOP SO CORRUPTED. BC YOU COULDN'T FIND NOTHING BETTER TO OFFER THAN OBAMA CARE. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE YOU JUST HAVE LOBBYISTS TO PAY BC THEY PAID U TO KILL OBAMA CARE. CORRUPTED
@realDonaldTrump invoked the 2nd Amendment when talking about Clinton. Miss me with interrupting meals, public shaming or protesting by the left. NOT THE SAME! @GOP , you failed!! #FalseEquivalency #unfit #MAGAbomber
@realDonaldTrump No, media has no role to play with your vile and vicious rhetoric, it is all you so shut the hell up about the mainstream media. Go tell it to fake Fox News you damn whiner.
You know the theory that @realDonaldTrump is actually a genius politician because he has so many scandals and moments of incompetence that we lose focus on all of them? Seems like @MattForMontana , @GregForMontana , Corey Stapleton are trying it out in Montana this week. #mtpol
Te he he. I got #RealNews for them. They've been exposed & they's no turning back no matter how big the hissyfits they throw get. I'm betting @realDonaldTrump is just gonna keep calling em out for what the are. And he needs us to keep cheering him on for all we're worth. #Winning
@realDonaldTrump just shut your pie hole. The media is doing NOTHING WRONG. It is your pathetic @$$ we are hoping the blue wave wins
@realDonaldTrump no baseball players are on their knee during the national anthem @MLB
@realDonaldTrump Dictators hate the free press. That would be you.
Call it as it is @realDonaldTrump this is a #WhiteAmericanTerrorist or #DomesticTerrorism so much #Hatred around our #CountryUSA #TrumpDontCare
Thanks @realDonaldTrump for motivating all the wackos of America. #cnn @FoxNews
However the only one actually using the situation to score points is @realDonaldTrump You are the moral leader of the United States and it's your responsibility to calm tensions and meaningfully call for unity.
MSM needs to drop the soft labels and call it like it is. These bombs were an act of terrorism acted upon by the direction of #Cult45 's ring leader, @realDonaldTrump . I'm not going to spare his feelings if he's not going to spare our lives. #TruckFump #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/lCYC9IRcu3
@realDonaldTrump You DGAF about Americans. Look at your response about Charlottesville. Your response to the journalist in Saudi. And now with the parcel bombs. You are a terrorist sympathizer plain and simple, and a #Moneylaunderer
What the actual fuck?! @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/2dYkleqH0m
@AshaRangappa_ @JamesAGagliano @joshscampbell hey all! Is this a legitimate ?: Is it in the purview of: @FBI @NYPDCT @CIA @SecretService to "forbid" @realDonaldTrump from hosting #rallies until completion of #bombsuspect and #bombscares ? #CharlotteNC Hope can get an answer THX
Gotta keep retweeting this! Makes me incredibly happy!!! #StillYourPresident @realDonaldTrump #PatriotsUnited #TriggeredSnowflakes pic.twitter.com/dkLP2kj4HQ
@realDonaldTrump You lose every argument when you refuse to Condemn the Bomber when he tries to Assassinate former Presidents and other /1
@realDonaldTrump OMG can't believe you're at one of your cult gatherings and still blaming media, take ownership of the division you have created along with the hatred! This "bomb" stuff, as you put it, is All on you!
@realDonaldTrump I guess they caught your buddy. Now what?
@realDonaldTrump show's ratings revolve around amplifying hate, anger and bigotry! He will never change. Vote his corrupt @GOP out of power!
"I think they're looking pretty good...But I'm here tonight because we can't take any chances," @realDonaldTrump says.
@SecretService may want to look at shutting down @realDonaldTrump rallies as it is pretty clear that domestic terrorists are now being radicalized there.
Then your lying when you said that you have been to a number of his rallies or you wear ear plugs. This one is no different and the people are loving @realDonaldTrump
@Twitter should take a stance on the violence @realDonaldTrump is inciting. His slanderous tweets directed at specific individuals should be treated as every other abusive tweet and his account should be CLOSED! Wake up, America- he is DANGEROUS and inciting VIOLENCE! #Vote
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr President, I live in Saipan we were just hit my tropical storm Yutu, I was hoping you would send electricians to help restore our power grid. God bless.
