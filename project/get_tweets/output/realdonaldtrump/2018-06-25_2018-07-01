So @realdonaldtrump are you offering to get these fools out of jail for attempting to kill journalists? Because you have in the past when people spoke out at your rallies. Say how's that old freak's trial coming? Is he your campaign manager now?

@jstephenson1984 I followed you - I felt bad. So few followers and so much to say. You don't get much satisfaction from trying to interact with @CBCNews @CBCAlerts @realDonaldTrump and the like. It's like yelling into an empty box. Not too rewarding. Feel free to follow back.
We're one supreme court appointment away from the long "fundamentally transforming the USA" nightmarish dream of radical leftists being flushed down the toilet for two generations. And the maestro @realDonaldTrump is overseeing it. Life is good. #MAGA

I'm waiting for "great piece" on why American journalists are "enemy of the people," as @realDonaldTrump described them. #Trump created this atmosphere of hatred toward media members who work hard to report truth. But it's clear "truth" is uncomfortable for lawbreakers.

@realDonaldTrump Really? Now you accuse Dems of going after the police, just because some disagree with how you are using ICE to forward your racist agenda? Its YOUR fault they are compared to the Gestapo, not theirs, and not the dems!
Sounds like you've got another President @realDonaldTrump in the making.

It ends when Swedistan votes to become Sweden once again. Then you can deport the scum, look at @realDonaldTrump in America, deporting MS-13 gang members and actually protecting the border, chosing who comes in. Italy is also doing well. Sweden can still be fixed in September.
@realDonaldTrump So A$$hole Why don't you get your people to march? So us that majority Oh, they're all white supremacists They can't come out in the open? I saw about 15 of your people today I saw over a million of my people today You continue to lose #SoMuchLosing

Thanks for sharing the interesting info from the United Nations. I am more likely to believe them than @realDonaldTrump and his team of liars!
Because @realDonaldTrump cannot impose sanctions on the U.S. Crippling the U.S. economy with tariffs is the next best thing for China and Russia. Also, China will seize market share of soybean industry and all it cost them was a few trademarks for Trump Organization.

@realDonaldTrump will go down in history as the finest American we've ever had. Unlike Obama who devided this country. I bet you don't want to have a conversation about that. He sent his henchmen Eric Holder to start as much trouble as possible in Fergussen. That's the problem!!
