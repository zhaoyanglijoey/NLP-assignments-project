It really is true. You have to sell your soul to align with or work for @realDonaldTrump . Once you do there is a permanent #taint you can never wash off. It's irreversible.
On this three year anniversary of @realDonaldTrump 's presidential campaign announcement, let's watch @seanhannity 's favorite video! https:// youtu.be/RE-uhXKO-nk
many child traffickers hate @realDonaldTrump 's policy of separating children from child traffickers.
Hmmmm, @NancyPelosi , pretty sure that it's your cesspool of a party trying to turn this into such a huge issue. You don't care about these kids, you only care about trying to smear @realDonaldTrump . #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide #KAG #KeepAmericaGreat
@realDonaldTrump Sound familiar??? pic.twitter.com/lzUyRXJH45
@realDonaldTrump is a total space cadet and should be the first shot into orbit!! "Space Force"
@realDonaldTrump shame! You should feel shame! People need to shame you until you understand to feel it! So shame! Shame on you! Pushing laws that separate families is shameful & inhuman, you should feel shame!
It's a shame we didn't have a Space Force back in my day. The lower gravity would have allowed those of us with bone spurs to actually serve our country. Thanks @realDonaldTrump ! #MAGA #VoteHankle
To the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP , how about getting your testicles out of @realDonaldTrump pocket!!! This is not Christian thing to do. Destroy families during the week and sit in pews on Sunday. Appeal to your humanity that is if you have any!! #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct

Maybe it's law's now being enforced. It'd be careless to turn the people loose that enter illegally with kids that can't be proven as their own. Stop child trafficking by enforcing border laws, that's what @realDonaldTrump & @ICEgov are doing. #ProudAmerican #MAGA #BuildThatWall

@realDonaldTrump You have the authority to stop the child abuse your administration is inflicting upon immigrant children. Do the right thing and pick up the phone and tell them to stop. #KeepFamilesTogether
In America, we take care of our children. People that hurt our children are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Why the hell isn't @realDonaldTrump being prosecuted by the child abuse caused by his hands only?!? Trump must be stopped. This is insanity. Sweet Jesus!
@realDonaldTrump FIRE EVERYONE! OR NOTHING WILL EVER GET DONE! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE NOW!

@realDonaldTrump stay strong the people responsible for kids being separated are their parents not you,not me and not Americans the parents who illegally dragged them to the border are to blame
So...if these children were actually the victims of human trafficking, we are responding by furthering their abuse by locking them up and making them sleep on cement floors? Thank goodness for @realDonaldTrump making America "great" again...
Absolutely! #ShinyObject #PresidentMoonbeam @realDonaldTrump This will Not distract Anyone from All Your Criminal Activites including holding Children as Hostages.
@realDonaldTrump here is the truth. there is no law to seperate children pic.twitter.com/4ufR6VIv5G

@grantgust now that @realDonaldTrump is fully invested in the space force do you think the speed force is next?

Yes he can if he builds a Dyson sphere.... to encompass the sun and all inner planets. It will keep illegal aliens the greens and the grays out . Trumps kind wont want them in our country...probably cost 100 trillion or so there goes the budget! @realDonaldTrump

Hey @realDonaldTrump We already have the National Aeronautics and SPACE Administration you ignorant dolt. Try funding it instead of creating more bureaucracy and big government. I thought you were against that, hypocrite.
@realdonaldtrump if we have a space force, will you tell us which species we are legitimately defending earth from and are you complicity saying for sure there is extraterrestrial life on or near earth as it stands today? What is the current threat level from those forces?
@realDonaldTrump and his equally fascist "senior adviser" Gestapo chief Stephen Miller blame child kidnapping on Dems b/c Dems won't give him border wall. In that case, I blame my boss not giving me a raise for my Web surfing, news reading and tweeting at least 4 hours out of 8.
Our Congressional delegation seems to rather hear children terrorized than get a nasty tweet from @realDonaldTrump .
Also @realDonaldTrump you realize creating a space force is illegal? Look into the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. @KellyannePolls you need to advise this #IdiotInChief before he speaks. #FUCKTRUMP #MoronInChief #Dotard

@theresa_may Dear Prime Minister, please cancel the visit to the United Kingdom by @realDonaldTrump . He is currently wrenching children from their parents and imprisoning both, whist withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council. He is not our friend.
@realDonaldTrump is an asshole.
I think it's funny that when supporters of family separation are trying to blame it on everyone else but @realDonaldTrump , it never occurs to them that the President should aspire to be better. NVM. It's not funny. Kids are suffering. #KeepFamilesTogether
very important fact, @realDonaldTrump has the support of millions of US voters. Did you hear speech given today to @NFIB , judging from clapping, @NFIB stands behind with "full" support.

We as a country should learn the lessons of history to not repeat the dark days of the mistakes made. But since @realDonaldTrump does not know history and is not willing to learn any lessons we are doomed to be shocked by him over and over again with cruel and abusive policies!

@realDonaldTrump . And then there's God's judgment concerning you, Donald. You're 72? You need serious help, and not from anyone afraid of you. You need tough, wise people of unassailable integrity, and you must *listen* to them! Step 1 is admitting you have a problem.
@realDonaldTrump NO AMNESTY whatsoever. It will only invite millions of others to cross our borders ILLEGALLY in the hopes that we will be STUPID ENOUGH to do this again. We did it in the 80s and now look at where we are.

Having watched that video that you put on twitter, obama did not agree with @realDonaldTrump on immigration. Obama said illegal immigrants would be deported. Under trump, illegal immigrants are treated like dogs in cages in an animal pound.
@realDonaldTrump if a person rode the top of the subway with their CHILDREN youth protection wpuld remove those kids. If I was homeless youth protection would remove my kids. Why does an illegal immigrant get better treatment? Now it will be FAMILY centers. So a guaranteed bed

MS13 was born in the USA. Why aren't you stalking them about their birth certificates like you have done for years with the Obama family&have never apologized or let up? @realDonaldTrump

Serious question, is there any chance @realDonaldTrump will go to jail once sanity returns to this country? All tyrants fall. There will come a day where all these people need to be held accountable.
Character limitation clarification, @realdonaldtrump is an entitled, ignorant bigot, but calculated in persona and ethos manipulation with his younger interviews, the apprentice bankruptcy recoveries (part luck), and understanding that any publicity is good publicity.
