@realDonaldTrump the judiciary Committee spent most of its time politicking. Many were there for decades. Re-election always dictates the vote. Term limits could eliminate much of that.
As @SenateGOP we should have surrounded @JeffFlake with our constituents after his decision. He was accosted with a disproportionate representation of the country. He folded. This is disgraceful. @realDonaldTrump @greggutfeld
We Americans hope @JustinTrudeau and our Canadian good friends and neighbors all realize that insecure obsolete old men like @RealDonaldTrump MUST be the party to "break up" first.....!
I bet @realDonaldTrump hates how everyone is paying so much attention to @BrettKavanaugh and not him right now. I just worry about what he's been up to while he's not being scandalous for a few hours
They are attempting a coup in all successful areas of America, legal system, constitution, culture, WH, etc. they are greedy treasonous people who have sold their souls to the devil. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
I hope this also will include a thorough background check on #FordIsALiar @realDonaldTrump @FBI @POTUS
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne @kany @RealCandaceO Twitter has now suspended @ThomasWictor This is unacceptable... please RT. Please stop this. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump i hope you have instructed the #fbi to investigate ford as well. As there are two sides . Seek to find out if payments have been made to ford , and to monitor her accounts for any future payments that may arise from her testimony.
@dbongino How long does a former President receive SS protection at our expense? Why should we pay for security when a former President goes overseas to speak? They received large payments. Why not have the event holders pay for security detail included? @realDonaldTrump

This is his way of sticking it to @realDonaldTrump whom he hates. I predict he votes No even after the FBI comes back and says I told you so nothing to investigate bc of no evidence plus the time that has passed! No Dimm will change their mind, in fact they'll say it was a sham!
@realDonaldTrump isn't it funny, well, not funny; however, your nomination for a supreme court judge has sexual misconduct in his past (potentially) So, what's the deal, are you people drawn to each other?

The #GOP does not represent me, they represent @realDonaldTrump who represents himself. I do believe the Dr Ford but after watching #Kavanagh yesterday he revealed that he is as unqualified to sit on the Supreme Court as Trump is to be president #VoteThemOut #TrumpResign

Well, I'm sure they've already run that by @senatemajldr McConnell... another RINO. He keeps telling @realDonaldTrump not to rock the boat BEFORE the Mid-terms. @POTUS will draw a line soon against the RINOs.
@realDonaldTrump @senjudiciary @GOP @SenateDems This American citizen requests an FBI Investigation into Dr. Ford. Starting with HS. We deserve to know everything about her past & patterns as well.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @ChuckGrassley @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC Imperative @FBI does background checks on both Ford also. Good for the goose. Also recommend demanding independent psychological profile on Ford. To determine lying pathology.
Imagine that, he caves in to their daft demands, and they reward him with this. Never yield and inch, if you do, they'll ask for a mile. This is why @realDonaldTrump won, the Republicans have lost their mojo.
Got an email today from @RepKevinBrady thanking me for his support, advising me to not respond to this email. Strange, since I asked him where he was in support of @realDonaldTrump . Not praising him at at all. Calling him out. Silent Just a Swamp Creature Tx8th deserves better.
@realDonaldTrump should announce 2 or 3 other possible nominees if Kavanaugh isn't confirmed so Democrats will be forced to divide their forces.
@realDonaldTrump thank you for looking out for us Americans, I waited a long time for a president like you.
i must congratulate the democrat party on their great victory today. not only have they defeated the Kavanaugh nomination , but now no one will accept a nomination or an appointment by @realDonaldTrump to any office requiring senate confirmation. @seanhannity
