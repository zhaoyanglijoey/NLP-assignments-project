The people of Iran are toppling the Government, now this is MAGA @realDonaldTrump
$7.25 federal #MinimumWage is a shame. Disgrace. Inhumane. I dare @realDonaldTrump or any politician who supports this to live one month taking $7.25 wage. Kudos to 18 states who are raising the number.
Just think if the Iranian People had GUNS to defend themselves against the dictatorship, it would soon be over. The Obama dictatorship couldn't get off the ground because of our weapons. Thank GOD for @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump not surprised that CNN supports legal pot.After all they seem to be wack jobs anyway.Maybe they are toooo busy smoking pot to fact they check their stories.The fake news problem could actually be a pot problem. Sometimes at night Don lemon looks stoned. lol
. @realDonaldTrump since you have become president, planes average taking off and landing 3 hours late. Wtf did you do and fix this fast or you're the worst president ever. (Lol jk you are the worst president ever and nothing will change that) #maga
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Why did the ERA fail? Why was it never resurrected? The country of Iceland just mandated that all employers employing 25 or more people must pay women the same as they pay men for doing the same job! Maybe it's time we followed their lead!
Dear Prince Harry-tell @realDonaldTrump to fuck off. Invite whoever you want. Obama's would bring a great gift too.

@realDonaldTrump Please stop all the gov/t handouts Elon Musk talked Obama out of. If his companies cannot thrive on their own, let them go out of business. Taxpayers are sick of this bullshit.

#MAGA Tickets Crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to get out & vote for @realDonaldTrump and kick it BIG TIME!
The only way to get results would be if @POTUS @realDonaldTrump appoints Special Counsel. IGs are powerless and Trump is the TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL. @TheJusticeDept @FBI are clearly obstructing justice and the buck stops with Trump. It's his administration! @WhiteHouse
If one looks at @realDonaldTrump as a CEO visiting and checking Trump company services for himself, one could regard him as very hard working indeed. If he didn't happen to have a whole other job as President of the United States, that is.
@realDonaldTrump is a small sad man
The Russian bots are deep in the twitter feed of @realDonaldTrump .

Does this mean all @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump brand companies will stop using slave labour? Oh right - I thought not.
@realDonaldTrump beside criticizing PAK on Twitter , You should practically utilize Atomic Bomb on the intelligence Agency (ISI) of Pakistan to protect the world from this Devil (PAK) & terrorism!!! PAK is striving to create hardships for the humanity, now u have to forbid them.
All you had to do was organize weekday general strikes in all economic centers and @realDonaldTrump would have had to resign right after inauguration.
They don't want @realDonaldTrump getting the credit. Their future is getting darker by the day. @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @JohnKerry @brhodes @Comey Get those ankle bracelets or room and board with three square meals a day.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sure, you're a genius and your dick is huge, and women love it when you assault them, and your tax returns prove your wealth. Fool your rube base, not the rest of us. #thenub secret service code name. #citruspuppet
There's only one way to confirm @realDonaldTrump is a #genius : #Jeopardy ... #POTUS v. Anyone.
What fkng triumphs? There are no triumphs to ignore. What's being ignore is your reporting on @realDonaldTrump s fkng mental state, his paranoia, his growing dementia, possible no-polar disease. Of course that's expected from #TrumpStateNews .
@realDonaldTrump NEWSFLASH you are a laughing stock around the world.
It would be helpful if @realDonaldTrump were arrested immediately, tried, convicted and put behind bars as soon as humanly possible.

Why should @realDonaldTrump show up to an event where you will disrespect and slander him? It is not his fault spoiled celebrities backed an unlikeable, corrupt candidate, touting failed policies and the American people rejected her.

@realDonaldTrump No it wouldn't be very helpful if the US had stronger libel laws.Only tyrants, despots, & authoritarians silence the written word. However it would be helpful for you to act with dignity. If you can't stand the heat in the oval office, get out of the White House.
@SenToomey in light of your legislative advocacy related to North Korea, do you have anything to say about @realDonaldTrump 's incendiary tweets and their effect on our nation's attempts to deal with a nuclear North Korea? Or will you maintain your habit of cowardly silence?

Couldn't agree more. Although @Oprah may be an infinitely better person than @realDonaldTrump , she still may have a lot of his shortcomings. Besides, is she ready to divest herself of her empire as Trump should have?
First of all...I'd like to thank @jaketapper for ending that joke of a presidential advisor, @StephenMillerAL . His job was to make @realDonaldTrump feel better about himself and attack CNN. Trump is a chickenshit and is running scared of the Mueller Investigation...get ready!

@realDonaldTrump NO DACA. Build the wall. No Amnesty. No lottery. No chain migration. Build the wall. Lying Dems will never keep their promises. They promised a wall to Reagan. They promised to fund a wall--700 miles--43 miles completed. They do not keep their promises.

@realDonaldTrump NO DACA Amnesty! NO compromise with Democrats! ENd the benefits illegals are receiving at the hands of hard working residents! KEEP YOUR PROMISES! NO DACA!! NO COMPROMISE!!!
@realDonaldTrump Wow! Russian women coming to USA just to have babies. AND get US citizen ship cause they are born here. Staying at TRUMP properties, paying of course. Nice way to make money on something you claim to be against. @SenWarren
The "see, I'm not crazy" meeting with members of Congress from both parties today (in which @realDonaldTrump presided over televised immigration discussions for nearly an hour) will only prove effective if the "very stable genius" ( #VSG ) lays off idiotic tweets and other nonsense
Counting on you @realDonaldTrump to #BuildTheWall stop chain migration, end lottery visa, need E-Verify and the Raise act, merit based immigration. THIS IS THE ONE CHANCE to get it done right. #MAGA
So @IvankaTrump , how about 'coming together' , nice choice of words by the way, and coughing up some $ to help all the women your dad, @realDonaldTrump grabbed by the pussy. Just a thought.
@realDonaldTrump I WOULDNT MAKE UP OR IMAGINE WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU THINK ABOUT IT WITH ALL MY EXPERIENCE AND WITH WHAT MY STEPFATHER PULLED WHY WOULD IT NOT BE THE WAY IT IS I MEAN SERIOUSLY

The Twitter trend is summarized as @realDonaldTrump "says he'd prefer immigrants from Norway instead of Haiti or Africa." That's NOT why it's newsworthy and trending. It's because he called the latter countries "shitholes". Poor Twitter, always worried about its bottom line.

Given the negative experience of @realDonaldTrump 's appointee ( Ambassador) in Norway and its journalists, #MoronInChief may need to reconsider his comments.

@realDonaldTrump says he wants immigrants from Norway, which is ironic considering they have a universal healthcare system that the @GOP hates so much.
"Kitchen table talk", "locker room talk", it's amazing how much of this talk @realDonaldTrump does considering that he's never in either position. Unfortunately this is not the normal "White House talk".

Amazing how many Americans wanted to cross those feelings to the north following election of @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump As a social science researcher, I have to agree with the need for accurate information. Too much research addressing lower SES & economic strife points to one minority group or another. This causes confusion & development of bad policies & programs. Voodoo scien.

You are being used. @realDonaldTrump thinks no more of you than he does about the Haitians and Africans that he so reflexively disparages. You claim he cares about Americans, yet he hires foreign workers, makes his products overseas, builds with Chinese steel, and cheats vendors.
Well, I'm counting the days. @realDonaldTrump seems to have ramped it up since you've been off air!
And yet, despite the possibility of it being any number of shithole countries, @realDonaldTrump hasn't yet authorized ANY kind of government cybersecurity initiative to protect us from this ACTUAL threat. I guess he thinks his wall would do that, too.
@realDonaldTrump America needs a President who does create division on a daily basis. The News Media is not creating drama you are.

I see why. @realDonaldTrump has shown how inept every other world leader is. In 1yr POTUS TRUMP has done more for the working middle-class families than Obama wanted to do in 8yrs.

During the campaign, @RealDonaldTrump lied to you (shocker) about the size of the U.S. trade deficit w/China. Said it was $500 billion. Even with it growing 10% during his first year as president, it's nowhere close to that /2

When the @WhiteHouse edits the words the @realDonaldTrump spews, YOU, nor anyone there has any right to complain about something POSSIBLY being misquoted. (we won't even get into the outright lies)
As the labor participation rate stagnates while unemployment rate falls to 17 year lows... how should we interpret this? Let's ask @realDonaldTrump and candidate Trump.
The MSM want so desperately for the slur to be true that it will matter little that the only one making the claim is someone who is a proven liar during virtually the same circumstances. At least @realDonaldTrump now knows that he can't trust Democrats to be honest abt anything.
Your time Madame Speaker would be better spent in trying to help your constituents and by constituents I mean Dreamers who will lose all hope unless you and your cronies start negotiating in good faith with @realDonaldTrump ...
How can Hawaii have this going on on the other 48 states are blissfully ignorant of what is going on? Why didn't military step in to kill it if false? Did we have an increase in security levels at SAC???? @realDonaldTrump @TulsiGabbard

Agreed. Melania also falsely claimed a college degree to bolster her immigration status. She lied. Under the law, she can be stripped of her citizenship & deported. #MAGA , right @realDonaldTrump ?
Well, thanks to @realDonaldTrump , Warren G. Harding will no longer be considered the worst president... Scraping the bottom of the barrel here, trying to come up with some upsides.
It isn't worth destroying your dignity, integrity & humanity to lie for @realDonaldTrump , @GOP senators. #UnfitToBePresident #ImpeachNow

No way this should be passed without knowledge of what @DevinNunes saw. What patriots will stand with you @tedcruz @TomCottonAR @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @GOP Seriously abuses during last election much bigger threat than Russia. Protect our rights or fail history
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should listen and take notes from President Reagan...
I do not believe @realDonaldTrump ever in intended to create a pathway to citizenship for DACA. He believes that there are only two types of immigrants; criminals and those that work for him. He has sabotaged solutions & forbidden the @GOP to find a solution.

@realDonaldTrump I do not want you to cave on a standalone DACA bill. That's what has happened for YEARS, Congress has had 4 months or longer to find a real solution and they simply refuse. CONGRESS as a whole must compromise and get a REAL bill.
@realDonaldTrump needs to deport them all so fast that MSM liars can't keep up!! Keep deporting them because we all know it is the only chance DEMS have to stay in power since American citizens do NOT support DEMS! #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump does not like hearing the truth about himself. @realDonaldTrump does not take any responsibility for his words or actions. @realDonaldTrump is never wrong and never admits to being wrong. Only others are wrong, never @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump I'm waiting for the fake media awards. If o stand corrected it was held off until today. Your letting me down... which isn't uncommon these days.. But hell it may be just about the only thing you've done I've looked forward too. What a let down
It's a "stormy" time for declaring success with this attempt at presidency, @realDonaldTrump .
Which ever reporter asked the military Doctor if Trump had false teeth deserves the FAKENEWS AWARD. What kind of inappropriate, stupid question was that? @realDonaldTrump @RealAlexJones

Serious question: Was this part of @realDonaldTrump 's much-ballyhooed Fake News Awards that he promised for Wednesday afternoon? Trump praises Bob Dole at Capitol Hill award ceremony @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2Dj2k1t
And THIS is why @realDonaldTrump should never have run for office - all his dirty little secrets are coming out for us to laugh at... he should've kept his scam secret.
@realDonaldTrump You're NOT helping. By all means, tho, do continue.

When asked once on TV what @realDonaldTrump and his daughter Ivanka had in common, he answered (to her bemused chagrin), "Sex." IMHO, she didn't seem as shocked by that answer for it being wrong and completely out of nowhere, as is she did for it possibly being secretly true. ijs

Still no arrests? @realDonaldTrump
If the government is to shut down, IMO, it is very selfish and politicians are not thinking about the constituents who voted them in to represent them. They are only thinking about themselves and their own agendas. Put your hate for @realDonaldTrump aside and think about the ppl.
@realDonaldTrump I viewing the Brett Baier show 2nite (1/18/2018), Napolitano stated that you should NEVER sit down to be interviewed by Mueller. I agree. He is looking for any opportunity to trap you. Why Talk to them...? ''No'' lawyer would allow you to jeapordize yourself..!

@realDonaldTrump people will be boycotting the SOTU address. Your ratings will be in the toilet right were they belong.
Is there anything more inept than a #GOP that can't get a full year budget passed 4 months into #FY2018 ? @realdonaldtrump @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @senateGOP
@realDonaldTrump Time to bring in professional People to create a real budget for our economy, many companies can handle this job, the time has come to let the pros take over the numbers
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump thought he was making great deals all his life and never even suspected that he's just been running a laundry .... Is he that stupid ?

So....does @realDonaldTrump have a subscription to #Forbes or does he only buy the ones with him on the cover?
@realDonaldTrump keeps citing the military when discussing possible shutdown, implying that the military will also be shut down. Fear mongering, plain & simple. Essential spending such as military is not affected by a shutdown.
#RT @realDonaldTrump : House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!
The #WhiteHouse led by @realDonaldTrump The @HouseGOP led by @SpeakerRyan The @SenateGOP led by @SenateMajLdr control ALL levers of gov't. Who's to blame for gov't shutdown? YES, BLAME the @GOP ! The OBSTRUCTIONIST @freedomcaucus
Wake up dude. It's easy to vote on principle when u know the outcome beforehand or know ur vote doesn't actually matter. This is the difference @realDonaldTrump has brought to the shithole chambers in DC. He isn't interested in passing problems on to the next prez. Get it done

@realDonaldTrump Wishing you a Happy 1st yr Anniversary of your Presidency. We are so grateful & thankful for all the sacrifices you have made to save America and @MAGA . You never let us down & kept all your promises. Thank you President Trump! God bless you & God bless America!
How ironic that not only did the US government shut down on the one year anniversary of the @realDonaldTrump presidency, but with a republican majority in the house.
Nice try, dumdum, but no one is buying it. YOU and @realDonaldTrump are responsible for this mess. What a maroon.... #MitchLIES

Absolutely true! Check out Judicial Watch's post about Obama-vintage program still run by operatives of DHS and HHS, who are seeding country with illegal aliens using commercial flights paid for by your tax dollars. Does Trump know? Doubtful, but he will now! @realDonaldTrump
I really believe @realDonaldTrump should instruct the DOJ to go after @davidbrockdc and @mmfa for money laundering. @Newsweek found out this week there is a new sheriff in town. #ReleaseTheMemo
@realDonaldTrump 365 days TOO long
@realDonaldTrump I don't care about the shutdown. I just looked through at least 100 photos, reliving last January 20th. Your inauguration was the day that America was saved. This is our anniversary, we love you, Mr. President. !!

@realDonaldTrump You were much better on the Apprentice.....why not try something else beside President...it just doesn't suit you!

Somebody please let @SpeakerRyan and @GOP know that a few years ago @realDonaldTrump said that when there is a government shutdown is all on the president. #TrumpShutdown
To be fair - this is from an email @rebecccaballhaus received, I don't think she is pushing it as 100% accurate. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump should just be ashamed though.
At least someone is working hard besides me... @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
First it is announced that we are going tonstay in Syria for years to come and Afghanistan is blowing up, so much for @realDonaldTrump being a non interventionist.

@realDonaldTrump congrats on the first complete government shutdown when one party controls everything in U.S. history. A big achievement of just how pathetic the party in power is at governing.
@realDonaldTrump So they just made FISA worse and stronger! You have been a victim of FISA! Why would you allow them to do this? Did they bother to ask us? This is our country! Congress doesn't represent us! They just represent their pockets! Hypocrites!
@realDonaldTrump Please ban and take away ownership of media companies from those who are not natural-born US citizens.
So how is it fair that y'all will still be getting your paychecks but the people who fight for our country probably won't due to this government shutdown. @realDonaldTrump
Right...... So that 190,000$ from @realDonaldTrump to @StormyDaniels was for what then?
Imagine if President Shit-for-Brains spent his time trying to come up with a budget that could get 60 votes instead of his dumbass fake news awards show? @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump if Congress can't reach an agreement by the deadlines given to them, then why are they getting paid? Everyone else in the real world is reprimanded or fired when their job deadlines are not met.
Ooooooo CNN reporting Russian bots want the memo released, too! and Wikileaks! @realDonaldTrump what are you waiting for??
Please declassify the 4-Page memo. Release it to the public. Read it aloud at the SOTU. @realDonaldTrump #gop @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan WE MUST NOT LET THIS SEDITION STAND. DO IT FOR THOSE OF US WHO WANT TO MAGA.

Oh Steph, @realDonaldTrump does it every day, but with foul language about US Citizens. When a secretary lies to the senate, this is nothing. Prison is also possible.

Your thoughts are rational, @realDonaldTrump is ignorant & self centered.
@realDonaldTrump Even if the Senate sells out the people, please stay strong on the wall, ending chain migration, e-verify. As one of your supporters, I don't want any amnesty because it just keeps happening over and over again.

Hey @realDonaldTrump People are calling him President Kelly because he seems to be in charge and you are easily led by the nose. Weak and sad!
The ONLY reason I say MAY HAVE is that there is so much evil in our government and our country...time will tell if it's not too late. If not for @realDonaldTrump we would be in very poor shape. Thank God for him and We The People that voted for him.

@realDonaldTrump wanna really blow the democrats' minds? Veto the CR and tell them to get a final deal on the wall or you won't sign it.
@realDonaldTrump We appreciate the sacrifices that you and your family are making to restore America to God. We know that a vocal few do not appreciate what you do; but what really matters is that you are doing what God wants you to do.
The best #immigration deal for the @TheDemocrats to accept is no deal at all. By not reaching a deal @realDonaldTrump doesn't get his wall, more funds for #BorderSecurity , and the elimination of #ChainMigration and the #VisaLottery .

@realDonaldTrump has been exposed, and what's under the wig isn't a pretty sight.
Stephen Miller has the speech writing skills of an angry third grader and knows @realDonaldTrump struggles to read speeches out loud in public. The result is policy based on a limited vocabulary with no grounding in scientific research or critical thought.

Never ever in this history of the presidency where so many top admin officials have been questioned or indicted. This is bad for u @realDonaldTrump ! Mueller seeks to question Trump about Flynn and Comey departures http:// wapo.st/2n5EOKD
@realDonaldTrump The good news is Mueller wanting to interview you indicates he is coming to the end of his Obstruction Investigation. The bad news is he is moving past the conspiracy as he already has what he needs and he will focus on your families bank fraud/money laundering!
@realDonaldTrump no questioning
Well, pressure is on @LovesTrump4ever , as this question is going to get harder and harder as Mueller tightens the noose. So, Jeanie, while Trumps indictment is still sealed, why don't you enlighten us as to why you love @realDonaldTrump so much?

@realDonaldTrump As you well know Mr. President DACA is a Democrat Invention, contrived to change the balance of power in the US. NO AMNESTY, the solution is to take the DACAns and go case by case, on their merit. For example, Those serving in the military should be welcomed.
We can all agree @realDonaldTrump is an complete racist idiot... So why do people keep expecting him to say something profound when tragedy strikes again that involves white people? "When you're white it's alright."- @chrisrock

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President Trump this new deal for the 1.8million is a ruse. It won't be just the 1.8million. This is nothing but a slow walk to amnesty! After you're gone the number is going to grow to 7 or 8 million. Don't trust that TRUST fund for the wall.
@FCC Please revoke @FoxNews channel license immediately. They are constantly promoting conspiracy news stories (their FAKENEWS), Our country will be better without them. Stop the lies! @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @seanhannity @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
Stormy Daniels friend breaks silence and affirms @realDonaldTrump did have a sexual relationship with Stormy and attempted to have her even join them. Well that is enough to prove it for me. #TrumpSexProbe #ImpeachTrump Guess Trump and his lawyer lied?
@realDonaldTrump On DACA, NOBODY should get in line for citizenship until wall is completed. This way democrats can't defund wall.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for representing us so well abroad! We are so proud of you! God bless you! We love you! #AmericaFirst
@realDonaldTrump Whoever is advising you on DACA giveaway should be fired.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President it is a huge mistake to give amnesty to 1.8 million illegal aliens. All you are really doing is legalizing illegal immigration and encouraging chain migration. In the end it will be their whole 30 family members as well More like 45 Million
Not my grandchildren. I am ashamed to even allow them to hear anything he says. @realDonaldTrump is the worst example for any one especially children. He is a cheater a liar a racist ... and and and. Not for my grandchildren!! @POTUS44 was a real example is dignity respect

Now I see what @StormyDaniels was doing. By implicating @realDonaldTrump , she could grow her membership to her all access site. Smart and stupid.

LOL. He had a single month at 3%, now the toilet. Which means Obama still had more 3% months than @realDonaldTrump . Still can't beat Obama.

@realDonaldTrump YOU promised o help the poor but you did not you are a liar
Not surprising anymore, but still amazing. @realDonaldTrump does not understand: - Fed officials serve Constitution/country & not him - Yes, fighting back is obstruction - His word is not law
Correct. @realDonaldTrump has pulled the trigger on @TheDemocrats & has fully exposed them as the hateful #AntiAmerican bigots #ChampagneSocialists they truly are.
You have to been living under a rock. Economy, jobs, consumer confidence, market growth, security and that just for starters. Btw Jeb Bush is where? #ReleaseTheMemo #ImNotABot @realDonaldTrump

@HillaryClinton since you knowingly laid in bed, plotting the coverup during the battle, in which soldiers died and a US ambassador burned to death, how are you not charged with/imprisoned for dereliction of duty? They used to call that #treason . @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump
Oh man, @realDonaldTrump , I think it's hilarious that you somehow think you're the one responsible for the current positive economic climate. If anything, growth is starting to stagnate and you're leaving the common man in the dust while ignoring and not undestanding science.
#JayZ is #CriminalTrash ! And definitely not worth @POTUS @realDonaldTrump time! His response to those questions were beyond STUPID! Only the #ExtremeIgnorant complain when things are getting better for their race! #BlackAndSaidThat

No doubt, If any memo in that room had an ounce of @realDonaldTrump impropriety in it, it would have been leaked to MSM weeks go. Classified or not.
That quote by Adam Schiff just might be the impetus for @realDonaldTrump to read that 4 page memo at the state of the union tomorrow night.
Trish, I never knew there was a rule that said you had to blindly support and walk in lock step with every proposed @realDonaldTrump policy or law. Your taking exception is an example of your independent thought processes which is why I enjoy watching you. Don't ever change.
It's hard to imagine what Putin could have on @realDonaldTrump that's any worse than what we already know about. I mean, what atrocities are left? Cannibalism? Necrophilia? Coprophagia? Or could it be... #incest ?
@NBCNews - I'll tell you what @realDonaldTrump is going to do to move "our country forward." Not a damn thing. He thrives on division.
I would love if @realDonaldTrump would change the law that you have to claim your parents income until your 24 in the state of Florida. Even if I pay everything on my own and live out all on my own, no financial aid. This is a problem Donald.

Funny how Dems are quick to oppose Govt. transparency when it undermines their entire phony narrative about @realDonaldTrump . And for those on the left trying to create a false equivalency: GOP putting the Schiff memo through the same process as the Nunes memo #ReleaseTheMemo
@realDonaldTrump is so worried about a wall, how about we fix Flint first. I think clean water is more important than a damn wall
@realDonaldTrump will the rule of law service in America? Are some people too rich and powerful to investigate? Laws for poor only?
@DevinNunes and his cuckoo's nest run amok in DC. Covering the treason and corruption of the @realDonaldTrump admin.
Yeah they voted to only release the @DevinNunes memo while voting down the Democrats rebuttal. If @realDonaldTrump were truly innocent, this isn't the way to prove it.
@washingtonpost the only time in history when chain migration existed was in the slave trade ugly days of our country and @realDonaldTrump is aware of it
Republicans threatened National Security. It's like Republicans in releasing that memo to moggy the water before the house committee investigation starts. It's like placing a malware and then turning the computer on it won't work @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Impose Russian sanctions @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP
The attacks on the FBI are very concerning. This is furthering the divide amongst us and showing greater weakness and chaos to the rest of the world. @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP need to stop these dangerous public attacks and investigate quietly if there is something to see.

Also, @POTUS has 22M followers and @realDonaldTrump 47.2M followers. Even combined, that is fewer followers than @BarackObama has. So, Donald Trump's tweets are less valid than Barack Obama's tweets by your logic. Huzzah!

@realDonaldTrump JUST FYI, Mueller has a right to talk 2 the press on findings, if he thought it had value. If Mueller is not allowed to complete his case one way, he'll complete it by providing all his findings to all media. If Congress isnt going to use it, he may as well.

"It's A Great Time To Be An American." That's A Line In @realDonaldTrump #SOTU Tonight. These Are The Americans He's Talking About. #StateOfTheUnion @MSNBC @CNN @ABC @CBS #FBR #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/7ODSxNr7io
@realDonaldTrump has been bragging about the economy and unemployment. Well the fact of the matter is he inherited the hard work from @POTUS44 . Just like he did from his father. Everything was given to Trump. I guess you can say Obama is Trumps Daddy in the White House!
@realDonaldTrump BFD we will watch you read from the teleprompter. #morondon

Can't wait for all the fake news during State of the Union address @realDonaldTrump . #sad #TrumpCrimeFamily
. @realDonaldTrump says he wants to give a unifying #SOTU . He couldn't unify a magnet and a piece of iron.
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton @Comey @realDonaldTrump #ObamaToThePitOfMisery #KillaryToThePitOfMisery #ComeyToThePitOfMisery . #DillyDilly
@realDonaldTrump 's #StateOfTheUnion will just be chock fulled of talking points and won't really mean a word he says regarding unity. He more than likely judging by his @PolitiFact file he will.probably lie in this speech quite a bit.
They should be remembered by the voter next election cycle along ofcourse with many others whom have shamed our President and continued the push for division and divide. If you do not put the People our Country and support our POTUS @realDonaldTrump , Washington is not for you.
i will not watch the filthy scum @realDonaldTrump tonight. #BoycottStateOfTheUnion #BoycottSOTU #
. @realDonaldTrump how much did it cost you?
EXCERPTS RELEASED: @realDonaldTrump to call for: "New American Moment for United States" & to say "I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties." @wkyc
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump doesn't have the balls to fire or try to prosecute(for bullshit reasons) Robert Mueller himself so he's gonna try to send his Stooge Jeff Sessions to do it for him. GROW A PAIR YOU RUSSIAN STOOGE.
@realDonaldTrump STAY STRONG,TRANSPARENT FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND YOU. WE BELIEVE IN A FIRM HAND SHAKE, OUR WORD, THAT THE WAY US YANKEE IN N.H. DO BUSINESS. GO AND GET THEM SWAMP RATS, IN WASHINGTON, DC
Donald Trump is a far greater threat than Nixon ever was #TrumpMustGo #PutinsPuppet #TrumpRussiaConspiracy @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @GOPLeader @GOP @DevinNunes
You can see the name of donors during the livestream of the #SOTU , essentially borrowing NASCAR's business model, proving that @realDonaldTrump is our most white trash President.
watch @FoxNews they support our @POTUS and love this country #AmericaFirst @realDonaldTrump #CBS #SOTU2018
So @realDonaldTrump is hoping for a terrorist attack
I doubt very much that @realDonaldTrump is aware of this, and he'll most likely support Paul Ryan anyway, but we need to alert others and make Trump aware as well. Paul Nehlen should know that all Donald Trump's grandchildren are Jewish.

Screw @realDonaldTrump 's #SOTU - deny the fascist infant his precious ratings. I'm gonna watch a marathon of Obama's back to back.
@realDonaldTrump how do you establish a *unifying* tone while searching for illegal aliens attempting to attend your SOTU speech? What kind of thought process creates that scenario? Confounded!
If it's the right thing to do, @realDonaldTrump will do the exact opposite every time.
There is no way the #StateOfTheUnion is #breakingnews on any network. You literally know it is coming at the exact time, every year. If @realDonaldTrump moved it to 6:30 PM ET and decided to hold it at Trump Tower with #Putin , that would be #BreakingNews . #Overused
@realDonaldTrump He probably will say most of the right things. Anyone can say the right things. The problem... his actions show differently time and time again. Trump is just not a good person. #trump #StateofOurUnion

Somewhere deep down ol @SenSchumer agrees with @realDonaldTrump . Admit it! @KGBr67 @lvbrmuda @PA4TRUMPD @Tamie90507439 @southern4MAGA @IQDerriere @RealJamesWoods pic.twitter.com/nFrOM0Afnv
Yikes, people say the Dems are drooling morons - I didn't expect Kennedy to prove it during his response speech. If @realDonaldTrump had drooled like that during SOTUS dems would have claimed he was mentally incomp. #DemDoubleStandard #NationTrumpNews
Wait a minute - @ICEgov is a FEDERAL AGENCY - Federal always has jurisdiction over state? That's the whole grey area issue with legalized marijuana? So #ICE should be able to supersede STATE laws in power of FEDERAL laws? @realDonaldTrump FIRE DE BLASIO!
Totally shocked the CBO has advised Congress to raise the debt ceiling early to account for the revenue loss brought upon by the GOP tax scam to provide 1.3 trillion dollars to America's billionaires... @realDonaldTrump
I'm not as estimable as, a #mercer (PARTICULARLY by his metrics), @realdonaldtrump . Where you are concerned, I likely don't even rate on par with a #NorwegianImmigrant . But this poor darkie from Inglewood thinks that #Mueller appears unconcerned by the #NunesTrumpMemo . #GUILTY
So.... how large was the crowd watching your SOTU speech Mr. @realDonaldTrump ? I heard it was about 8 million less than Obama's lowest number.... LOSER! pic.twitter.com/yLZop63Kay
@SpeakerRyan deserved the SAME FATE as this innocent Saudi student that was MURDERED by a RACIST WHITE @realDonaldTrump supporter. Sorry to hear you survived the #AmtrakCrash . God will take care of U. @AP @620wtmj @WGNRadio @AP @CNNI @NPR @GOP #NoBanNoWall http:// on.jsonl.in/2jExD8D
Political propaganda, what about the poor? You clearly left us out,. Supporting @realDonaldTrump is only feeding his ego
. @DevinNunes working with @WhiteHouse to put together the #Memo makes it worthless. Nunes should resign or get ready to face Mueller. @realDonaldTrump & COS Kelly are in this up their eyeballs.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #releasethememo #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump February is Black History Month. Please do not indulge us with your rhetoric. You are racist and have no right to speak on this subject nor hold celebrations. My guess is you will Executive Order the removal of this month from the calendar.

@realDonaldTrump 's Russian code name (and I have this from reliable sources) is "Agent Orange", which is perfect since he's laying waste to the @GOP and American democracy. #ShitholePresident
You and Jim Jordan need to be replaced. Especially Mr. Jordan who is trying to discredit the #FBI and #DOJ . That is more un American than kneeling during the national anthem. So why is @realDonaldTrump not telling the American people to fire you. That's the plan though.
Hey @realDonaldTrump glad to hear you and @mike_pence can visit #WVirginia one dead is tragedy. 20 people died in #Mudslides in #Montecito yet.... #nothing are you President of United States, or just States that voted for you?
Americans are Dreamers too. - President @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #SOTU #DACA #TRUMP

Thank U @realDonaldTrump 4 a Grand Slam home-run during the SOTU. U knocked that ball so far out of the park it was gone, gone, & gone! Looking forward 2 UR infrastructure plans & the WALL. Please don't forget about the WALL. Giuliana loves U & UR family. Thank U and God bless.

Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. McCabe and all the women and men of the FBI for working to keep our country safe. The coordinated attacks on law enforcement by Congressional Republicans & @realDonaldTrump are wrong and must stop. STOP THE TREASON!

The "new moment" for America will be when people vote out #FakePresident @realDonaldTrump and the Republican swamp people.
@mitchellvii Just watched your latest YouTube doc. Enjoyed it and you, like your energy. You're dead on with @realDonaldTrump . This is the most winning we have had in 30 years.
Oh Noony Noony, naughty naughty. Good thing Trump sold you the family size Vaseline. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
Read it and weep @realDonaldTrump Nobody loves you, everybody HATES you, go out on the south-lawn and eat some worms.
It's funny how @realDonaldTrump is taking all of the credit for improving the unemployment rate in America after being in office for only a year. pic.twitter.com/SjCHX174Zn
#ReleaseTheMemo @realDonaldTrump
And yet, @realDonaldTrump , the most corrupt "president" in history, ignores the Emoluments Clause.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/mWLZ3BQxaP
it's pretty obvious @realdonaldtrump is a criminal, if not a Russian agent, in the White @WhiteHouse
And @AppleNews publicity stunt @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump 8mil fewer viewers than Mr Obamas! Most everyone knows a FAKE POTUS when they see one! LOL Mueller is coming for your fat ass traitor!
I don't understand why Dem won't take @realDonaldTrump 's hand. It's no secret they've summoned Satan with... https:// fb.me/2on16RY0r
A great speach by a great president. Who cares about the dems, they can't stand to see @realDonaldTrump succeed. He is truly making America again.
It's all good. If @realDonaldTrump can do, it's okay

I don't understand why Dem won't take @realDonaldTrump 's hand. It's no secret they've summoned Satan with spiritual cooking. Now the Devil showed up on thier doorstep and they don't like what they see. What did Dem think? Satan would be Dems servant, and give Dem the power?
Title of the definitive book on @realDonaldTrump time in office - "Unnecessary and Uncivil"
@realDonaldTrump gives a voice & platform to forgotten men/women & Juan Williams says he exploited them. Beyond the pale. Trump successfully rescued others & they weren't there.
Republican @realDonaldTrump supporters have become as callous as their heartless leader. Congrats you are no longer the party of "family values". you have no righteous pulpit to speak from anymore.
Trump lies are always so dumb that it gets boring trying to correct them. The scary thing is @realDonaldTrump ... https:// fb.me/1sSGrZFby

Okay, I get it that @realDonaldTrump is a narcissist, so I get it that he applauded himself. But did he have to clap next to the damn mic?

excellent evening with @realDonaldTrump @POTUS speaking from his heart. Wants to reach out.
If there is such a thing as "beautiful clean coal" I propose we gather all the byproduct and dump it on the lawns of all the lawmakers that think so. @realDonaldTrump is a cancer on the environment. http:// wapo.st/2DQ6FJU

The FBI/DOJ like most agencies are run by career bureaucrats who's power comes from the size of their budget and the number of people in their agency this is why they spied for @HillaryClinton we need @realDonaldTrump to #draintheswamp
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @seanhannity @FoxNews @JudicialWatch @SebGorka @DLoesch @danbonginoknows @PressSec @SaraCarterDC @TomFitton @JudgeJeanine TONIGHT IS THE TIME TO RELEASE THE DAMN MEMO BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS WE CAN'T TRUST THE FBI/DOJ
@SpeakerRyan knows @DevinNunes has been colluding with @realDonaldTrump on #NunesFakeMemo and so does #Mueller and @FBI . #MuellerIsComing #ObstructionOfJustice #TraitorTrump #GOPTraitors
Did I miss your "good day for trump to release his taxes"? Must send this to him @realDonaldTrump
Soooo, I saw something at #SOTU Is this the reason why we're getting nowhere with the DOJ & FBI? @realDonaldTrump is against a team of professional obstructionists, after all. pic.twitter.com/gmSckIaJDj
They should have thought about that before they conspired against the President. #ReleaseTheMemo . We have a right to know. FBI and DOJ serve at the pleasure of the President and so does Mueller. @realDonaldTrump . The President need to fire him and get this shame over.
Hey @realDonaldTrump can you pass an executive order so that cops can kick in my door and sucker punch me while I sleep? Also if your house costs less than $1 mill you should have to eat glass
Reasonable? If any of its "Facts" (R) True U (R) in (D)oubt. If U(R) supposed 2(D)eal in Fact Based Investigations Then Why would We accept Any misconduct Of any kind? Ever. & How (D)are Any1 expect Otherwise. U Answer 2 U.S. @FBI @TheJusticeDept @DNC @GOP @realDonaldTrump
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes Please #ReleaseTheMemo #CorruptFBI #CorruptDOJ
It's amazing that no one points out that @SpeakerRyan could fix this mess with @DevinNunes and calling for a new vote on the #Intelligence Committee regarding #ReleaseTheMemo For some reason they are just putting it all on @realDonaldTrump
CNN--yes, I said CNN--is now calling @realDonaldTrump the adult in the room. Hell has finally frozen over. #SOTU #MAGA http:// ow.ly/OgPP30i7Pro
@realDonaldTrump It's not going to work buddy. Too many lies u can't keep track of, too many illegalities, too many enemies. You're in too deep.
@realDonaldTrump Once DACA is ironed out it NEEDS TO BE ENDED FOR GOOD instead of doing this ALL OVER AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN!!!! We'll be FOREVER giving AMNESTY TO ILLEGALS!...ENOUGH

Its in your hands now for transparency . #releasethememos @realDonaldTrump
Rosenstein Didn't @realDonaldTrump demand a loyalty pledge from his supporters at a few of his rallies?
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, on your excursion to the Greenbriar W.V. meeting please come down to McDowell W.V. for a symbolic visit to the most poverty stricken area in the United States, truly the forgotten men and women of U,S, In desperate need of infrastructure
@NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats Such a shame that you were unwilling to rejoice in all that our country accomplished in the past year during the #SOTU The message from @realDonaldTrump transcended all political affiliations. #YourActionsSpeakLouder
@realDonaldTrump serves Russia not Americans.
@JoeManchinWV just switch parties like your Gov. You will win and be on the positive and winning side of the American people. Why is your head in the sand on this? @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson
Weird how this happens... @realDonaldTrump #MAGA After Trump tariffs, Chinese solar company says it will build U.S. factory - CNNMoney http:// cnnmon.ie/2Ft7RiE
@realDonaldTrump release the memo! "Do not fear their faces, for I (God) am with you"
We now know that @FBI Director Chris Wray is obstructing @realDonaldTrump 's attempts to obstruct Mueller's investigation. You know what THAT means! pic.twitter.com/6QKl6WWkKg
No problem - Just do what @realDonaldTrump did - go bankrupt and sell out to Russia. #MuellerInvestigation #RussianCollusion #RussianSanctions #VoteBlue2018

@realDonaldTrump will do whatever it takes to mislead the country if it helps him. He is all about himself. If you benefit as a result of him, then goody for you. If you don't, he doesn't care about you. He will lie, cheat and steal to get what he wants. Trump=Mafia.
Mr President, #ReleaseTheMemo Let the People decide. @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @POTUS @RepMattGaetz
@realDonaldTrump is Putin's BITCH
@realDonaldTrump MR.PRESIDENT people are saying thx Obama.For this surge.SHUT THEM UP.release Iraqi Dinar value now.6 million holders of this currency will MAGA.BECAUSE OF YOU.
The American Public will never be able to trust the FBI again if that memo is not released. That is the bottom line. #ReleaseTheMemoNow @realDonaldTrump #NunesMemo

@realDonaldTrump WE THE PEOPLE will remember every lie, and we will find every nickel he has stolen. GOP is no longer tough on crime party.

So, @DevinNunes tossed out his Congressional immunity by colluding with the @WhiteHouse and @realDonaldTrump to obstruct justice in order to prevent #Mueller from investigating collusion between #Russia and the #TrumpCampaign .
@realDonaldTrump At SOTU, Trump tells us to unify. InTrump Speak, that means everyone must now agree with him despite the continuing stream of lies, deceit, deflection, hateful tweets, harassment and firings. Seig Heil Mein Fuhrer. MAWA Make America White Again.
What we love even more, are the clips that show you laughing at the idea of @realDonaldTrump becoming President. You continue to be out of touch with the average American. #MAGA
The FBI has grave concerns over the release of the fisa memo. Yeah they do. They have dug their own graves. @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews #MAGA @KellyannePolls
Please @realDonaldTrump get that memo released. We are growing tired of this. #ReleaseTheMemoNow
Kelly used to defend the part of the Constitution that talks about freedom of speech. Now that he works for #FakePresident @realDonaldTrump , not so much.
