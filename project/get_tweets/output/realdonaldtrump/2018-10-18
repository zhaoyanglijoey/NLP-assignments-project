the derangement of left has no bounds. Amazing! This fellow is having an effect on this culture war if folks like you have to poison the well with shit like this. This video helps @realDonaldTrump .. you just don't realize it because the delusion and derangement is so strong
If you want to watch @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Rally in it's entirety turn to @OANN they will always air @realDonaldTrump Rallies. Thank You @OANN appreciate my new channel, Fox is getting as bad as MSM bye @FoxNews @OAN is channel 347 on @DIRECTV
@realDonaldTrump Marvelous success with Mexican deal on border. You do hvy lifting while congress hides and makes excuses. GOP rino's part of problem also! Still need wall however-----more liberal tactics to come. Stay strong for us REAL AMERICANS! MAG Maj. G. ret.
@realDonaldTrump yet an actual crime is committed You more'n likely joke
I get it. Sometimes @realDonaldTrump says things that are pretty wild, but it's always exactly how he feels & exactly what he means. #AmericaFirst is working & every #GlobalistFascist POTUS before him clearly has been exposed for doing nothing to help #America .
@realDonaldTrump is illiterate. I hope someone reads it to him.
@realDonaldTrump bitch scared to travel to a battlefield
@realDonaldTrump please step down. Just leave, we will love you all for doing that.
@realDonaldTrump ple trump help me amount.quickly.i am die.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, the EU & Europe must choose between Iran or keeping NATO. Russian SAM are now protecting Iranian SSM in Syria. Iran is a clear and present danger to and have threatened our middle east deployments & bases. Move against Iran before they can act!
Science shows that people who generalize all the time have very very low IQs and have no friends @realDonaldTrump.

Delimma #2 immigration We have another rush at our border. Past Presidents did catch & Deport whereas @realDonaldTrump has created Prison Camps. The most cost effective was catch & deport. Trump's Zero Tolerance Policy is costing millions per month yet has not acknowledged it's
Unfortunately it's accepted by @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP . And the supporters that want to keep them in power either don't care, or simply don't show that they do. I'm going with they don't care.
Stop falling for the shiny objects. IQ45 is just distracting from Mueller and Russia. @realDonaldTrump knows what he did, and he knows Mueller knows, too. IQ45 will live long enough to die in jail, unless he makes a deal with Mueller.
@realDonaldTrump has #MMGA Made Mexico Great Again
There have been many attempts to remove #AssaadWarCriminal & #PutinWarCriminal from Power ! When will you understand what needs to be done @realDonaldTrump @POTUS !?
... asked @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP if she now wonders how many times when @POTUS @realDonaldTrump was inside her he was actually thinking about @Ivanka in light of @StormyDaniels ' comments ...
@cbsnews reporting that residents of another Trump building have voted to have his name removed. Hmmm...Trump name now a stigma, maybe? Love it! Now, if we could erase his name from the WH, all would be well again. @realDonaldTrump #LiarInChief
Yo fucko @realDonaldTrump , a real politian is speaking on CNN Town Hall. He's polite, well educated, even speaks in full sentences!! WOW. I think you'd really hate him, bigly. #townhall #BetoORourke

Stand with @realDonaldTrump and #DefeatTester VOTE for Republican @MattRosendale for US Senate
@realDonaldTrump should pressure Honduras and Mexico to stop large amounts of people from marching to our borders.
When the #ElectionResults start coming in on November 6, whose gonna click over to @CNN and watch all the "fake news media" cry and throw tantrums when they realize the @RedTsunami and @realDonaldTrump kicked their ass again? I can't wait!!!
@realDonaldTrump A President for the People
We can feel the sorrow in your tweet. It must be very difficult to correct another hit job on our President @realDonaldTrump
You know he is a racist liar and never pays his bills never mind a bet for charity! @GOP has to go in November and @realDonaldTrump in 2020, this is our country not theirs! Stand up America we are better than this
Yep. @realDonaldTrump @elizabethforma pic.twitter.com/nnZVo2asnD
Wouldn't work it would drain the generator cos everytime @realDonaldTrump opens it's mouth it sucks
Rosie is so disconnected with reality, she doesn't even know that the military loves President @realDonaldTrump . There is absolutely no way they would storm the White House and "get" Trump. She needs to be institutionalized!
. @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump @potus is right that California needs to get its act together because in that state, their ballot is not only in ENGLISH. pic.twitter.com/gu9XBwmtNI

@realDonaldTrump Capt. my Capt.= Saw selected WALL, sorry didn't like design. Should be taller with 3-razor wire cap. Stop illegals using National Guard. I voted today Republican.

@realDonaldTrump Hey fat boy: you aren't "too busy" to visit the troops. You simply don't give a damn about the troops, or anyone but yourself. You are lazy. And a thief. And a stain on America. #MAGA morons are morons. #Trump supporters are stupid.
@realDonaldTrump would love to hear the snake poem tonight ! WE LOVE YOU MR. PRESIDENT ! #REDWAVE #KAG2020 #WALKAWAY #IAMTHENRA #VoterID #HesMyPresident #BUILDTHATWALL3FTTHICKER10FTHIGHER #draintheswamp
@realDonaldTrump you see this dude using your business logo in his business advertisement without your consent?
He should be ashamed. The appointment was a political one and the "investigation" was a @realDonaldTrump sham. His people got to set the rules that is why Trump had no prob with it. Watch the Saudi investigation. Bet it was a "rogue actor" that murdered the reporter. More sham
When are you turning back into your real form @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/LdsDAPbeM3
@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr President...at your rally tonight when you're rightly calling out the fake news please mention Q2 for me , lynn walker (they know me i call them and cnn out daily) ! their reporters just kept speaking over our national anthem in missoula...please!
When is Congress going to produce a bill that protects "we, the people," from these assaults disguised as free speech? When are these members of Congress who incite these "free speech" assaults going to be censored. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Mr President what can we be doing as hard working, blue collar Americans, to restore the Republic?
The problem is @realDonaldTrump thinks blacks are as gullible as his cult. Nah slim we don't roll like that! pic.twitter.com/3wum5LjhYd
Life as we know it. Republicans must win the midterms! If they do not the blame falls on both @realDonaldTrump and Republicans themselves. Not repealing and replacing Obamacare and not building the wall could cost Republicans the midterms.
@realDonaldTrump really has Rosie between a rock and a hard place! pic.twitter.com/lIPua5r8R0
@realDonaldTrump call Me a Liar Pattison! Of course there are 3 Witnesses and one is deceased
Wow... I LOVE how PASSIONATE this Patriot is in defending @realDonaldTrump & our country!

@BetoORourke is having a really great town hall on national TV while Lyin Ted @tedcruz is AWOL (scared). Ted seems to be too scared to stand up to @realDonaldTrump and too scared to face his Dem opponent. Texas really knows how to pick em. @seanhannity

@SenWarren - are you NUTS???? A SITTING SENATOR PROMOTING A #RESISTANCE SCHOOL. THAT IS TREASON!!! YOUR INTENTIONALLY COMMITTING TREASON ON A SITTING PRESIDENT.. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
@realDonaldTrump any money that we send to Guatemala, Honduras and even Mexico should be terminated and used to finish the wall ASAP if caravan is not stopped before it reaches USA.
@realDonaldTrump has been very restrained imo. This has worked greatly to his favor as the unhinged have become more vocally and physically unhinged. Now we really know what it is we are dealing with.
Dear @Twitter and @jack , please investigate why @realDonaldTrump has gotten 300K followers in the past month. How many are fake accounts? And what kind of misinformation are they spreading? In other words, do your job.
BREAKING! You do not want to miss @thebestcloser show tomorrow on #CloserNation , very special high profile guest at 6:30 am EST!!! @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @JackPosobiec #letshivadebate
@realDonaldTrump Doesn't care about this country, only about how much money he can steal from it. #treason #GameOnTiny
Yes, @BarackObama was better speaker, but he was not so good as @POTUS . #NoDramaObama . @realDonaldTrump is not good speaker, but he is fantastic President. Best President since RR. Go #TrumpPence2020 #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump please reply to this message with any reply. Even a thumbs up would be good. Just trying to prove a point to @unisa that I will be able to get a response from you before getting some sort of response from them. Let's have a bit of fun #AfricaAtItsBest

If we got to get the truth out of @realDonaldTrump 's administration or Trump's FBI the truth will never prevail. Sad but true.
Rosie has lost whatever she had left. That is at the very least sedition and advocating a coop. MHO she s/b arrested and sent to GITMO for trial. @realdonaldtrump Enough of this stuff.
Department of Education needs to be destroyed and return Education back to the States and The AMERICAN Family's! @realDonaldTrump MORAL COURAGE
Link for Trump's coverage, tonight? please share. Ripping pissed off with the @WhiteHouse . They have been told to cover activities and keep the public in the know as is occurring. Thanks goodness @realDonaldTrump tweets current info. else fakemedia will give their fake versions

@realDonaldTrump your interests in Saudi Arabia are well known. Especially the money your family and you are making. Level with the American people and show your Taxes from 2017 & 2018. Are you a pussy? ComeOn Don. Your no pussy!
Awe, so sad...guess you want to dish it out but not take it? #asexpected The #Truth is on the side of those who have the integrity and intelligence to reject the immorality of @realDonaldTrump and his #Cult45 . Bye!

@SteveSchmidtSES said something today on @NicolleDWallace show that startled me. His thesis was that @realDonaldTrump is insigating a 2018 style civil war in our country. Makes sense, yes?
