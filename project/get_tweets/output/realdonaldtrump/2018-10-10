Who cares? Won't happen. Meanwhile @MichaelAvenatti keeps helping @realDonaldTrump every time Avenatti rolls out another line of garbage.
And yet @realDonaldTrump is campaigning for money! #notsurprised
@realDonaldTrump wants to be president for whomever agrees with him or cheers for his hate speech. He name calls and leads "lock her up" chants at every rally. Shut up @KellyannePolls

Oooooohhh!! Gotta love that @realDonaldTrump stock market!! Well done!!
What pisses me off most is the fact that POS @realDonaldTrump doesn't even try to listen, to compromise, or to engage with opposing views. His way or the highway to hell
Why his rallies on this poor people @realDonaldTrump in the middle of cat 5 Harricane just go home stop screaming go home pls show his silver home
@realDonaldTrump is a small, petty man. Some day soon more of his supporters will figure that out. maybe will be when they find out how much he's taken from them; maybe when they realize he chose a rally over a hurricane of epic power in FL; maybe it will be the $500M he stole.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @AnnCoulter @TruthFeedNews @foxandfriends this sucker now wants a "new world order" one world government! Then we will see his elite, you know the HRC, Be it! What is up with it??
Well done @CNN on some very good reporting today on the hurricane. You guys are always so dedicated. Hope all out in the field are safe. Also, you should avoid even talking about @realDonaldTrump today, it's gross he's doing a rally today of all days.

Campaigning for @realDonaldTrump & sharing Conservative ideas is inappropriate & censored, but threatening a child's life is acceptable, as long as your liberal, I guess? @RealJamesWoods got blocked for much less than this.
@realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn is this another one of your intelligence posse who wants to entrap me. You are fortunate I am kind. Why don't you share that with flynn, these guys can't recognize drug users & I will now keep your name like theirs for slander. Trump you allow slander.
@realdonaldtrump only an inept little man would constantly insult people who choose to vote for a party other than yours. You are a disgrace to this country and should retreat back into the dark lying hole you have always resided in. Pennsylvania

Sick about how much money your 401K lost today? Blame @realDonaldTrump & the Republicans. 1. Trade war 2. Selling more Treasury bonds to pay for the tax cut. 3. Rampant spending. Their economic plan is one more way they are ruining America.
Strange that @realDonaldTrump didn't do his usual boasting about the stock market today.
@realDonaldTrump The disgraced and former Attorney General, top cop in America, just told fellow Democrats that violence is an acceptable response to dialogue you don't like. Scary. Eric Holder: When Republicans Go Low, "We Kick Them"
@realDonaldTrump But Hillary Clinton won 3,000,000 more votes that you did. You won the Presidency through the Electoral College. Not by the majority votes of all American Citizens.

Bcuz @realDonaldTrump is paying them 2/ they want 2 keep themselves in his good graces
@realDonaldTrump I thank you for resolutely saying that no country will be exempted from the oil embargo. This was the message of the President of the United States and everyone should cut off their oil from Iran by November 4.
Yes @realDonaldTrump it is more important to feed your ego than to remain updated on the damage of hurricane Michael.

Yeah,because your paid attendees won't get their trump checks. Well, they probably won't anyway because you are known to stiff your contractors @realDonaldTrump
Other than the optics, he might as well do the rally. We're talking @realDonaldTrump here. He's not going to make a difference.
