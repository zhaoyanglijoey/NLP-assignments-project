It really is true. You have to sell your soul to align with or work for @realDonaldTrump . Once you do there is a permanent #taint you can never wash off. It's irreversible.
On this three year anniversary of @realDonaldTrump 's presidential campaign announcement, let's watch @seanhannity 's favorite video! https:// youtu.be/RE-uhXKO-nk
many child traffickers hate @realDonaldTrump 's policy of separating children from child traffickers.
Hmmmm, @NancyPelosi , pretty sure that it's your cesspool of a party trying to turn this into such a huge issue. You don't care about these kids, you only care about trying to smear @realDonaldTrump . #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide #KAG #KeepAmericaGreat
@realDonaldTrump Sound familiar??? pic.twitter.com/lzUyRXJH45
@realDonaldTrump is a total space cadet and should be the first shot into orbit!! "Space Force"
@realDonaldTrump shame! You should feel shame! People need to shame you until you understand to feel it! So shame! Shame on you! Pushing laws that separate families is shameful & inhuman, you should feel shame!
It's a shame we didn't have a Space Force back in my day. The lower gravity would have allowed those of us with bone spurs to actually serve our country. Thanks @realDonaldTrump ! #MAGA #VoteHankle
To the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP , how about getting your testicles out of @realDonaldTrump pocket!!! This is not Christian thing to do. Destroy families during the week and sit in pews on Sunday. Appeal to your humanity that is if you have any!! #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct

. @CBP @ICEgov separating families & putting humans in cages who are treated worse than dogs at a kennel will not be a deterrent if thats what @realDonaldTrump 's administration objective is here. Families face death in their own country, a cage might be better than a coffin.

Maybe it's law's now being enforced. It'd be careless to turn the people loose that enter illegally with kids that can't be proven as their own. Stop child trafficking by enforcing border laws, that's what @realDonaldTrump & @ICEgov are doing. #ProudAmerican #MAGA #BuildThatWall
. @realDonaldTrump Dear current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington D.C. It has been a longstanding policy of the United States that we do not negotiate with terrorists and we do not pay ransoms of any kind to free hostages. Even if the hostage taker is the President.

@realDonaldTrump You have the authority to stop the child abuse your administration is inflicting upon immigrant children. Do the right thing and pick up the phone and tell them to stop. #KeepFamilesTogether
In America, we take care of our children. People that hurt our children are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Why the hell isn't @realDonaldTrump being prosecuted by the child abuse caused by his hands only?!? Trump must be stopped. This is insanity. Sweet Jesus!
@realDonaldTrump FIRE EVERYONE! OR NOTHING WILL EVER GET DONE! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE NOW!

@realDonaldTrump stay strong the people responsible for kids being separated are their parents not you,not me and not Americans the parents who illegally dragged them to the border are to blame
So...if these children were actually the victims of human trafficking, we are responding by furthering their abuse by locking them up and making them sleep on cement floors? Thank goodness for @realDonaldTrump making America "great" again...
Absolutely! #ShinyObject #PresidentMoonbeam @realDonaldTrump This will Not distract Anyone from All Your Criminal Activites including holding Children as Hostages.
@realDonaldTrump here is the truth. there is no law to seperate children pic.twitter.com/4ufR6VIv5G
I will living it if @BobCorker voted in favor of a wall that @realDonaldTrump suckered Republican voters across the country saying Mexico was going to pay for knowing dam well they weren't and I don't blame them. A blatant lie to who would've not voted for him. Race bait for vote

I totally agree. In addition, @realDonaldTrump and any other perpetrators of these ATROCITIES should be arrested, prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of our anti-terrorism and/or anti-kidnapping laws.
@grantgust now that @realDonaldTrump is fully invested in the space force do you think the speed force is next?
@realDonaldTrump What have you done with the young girls you had kidnapped? I hope to God that they are safe from sexual predators, you DESPICABLE human being!
@realDonaldTrump PICK UP THE PHONE. This feckless stunt has gone too far. Children for your wall? You disgust me. I will celebrate when you are impeached. #muellertime
@realDonaldTrump I think when you've been compared to Nazis the jig is up. Can you just start killing people so you can be brought down like the insane madman you are? You can't make this shit up.
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Please provide evidence of the law giving you the right to separate families. I want the exact law. And homeland security administration you will apologize. Watch

Question about space force: How much of the money will be spent fixing infrastructure of Puerto Rico? How much on returning children to their asylum seeking parents? How much on health care for poor, elderly, those with pre-existed conditions? Should I go on? @realDonaldTrump
Yes he can if he builds a Dyson sphere.... to encompass the sun and all inner planets. It will keep illegal aliens the greens and the grays out . Trumps kind wont want them in our country...probably cost 100 trillion or so there goes the budget! @realDonaldTrump

Hey @realDonaldTrump We already have the National Aeronautics and SPACE Administration you ignorant dolt. Try funding it instead of creating more bureaucracy and big government. I thought you were against that, hypocrite.
@realdonaldtrump if we have a space force, will you tell us which species we are legitimately defending earth from and are you complicity saying for sure there is extraterrestrial life on or near earth as it stands today? What is the current threat level from those forces?
@realDonaldTrump and his equally fascist "senior adviser" Gestapo chief Stephen Miller blame child kidnapping on Dems b/c Dems won't give him border wall. In that case, I blame my boss not giving me a raise for my Web surfing, news reading and tweeting at least 4 hours out of 8.
Our Congressional delegation seems to rather hear children terrorized than get a nasty tweet from @realDonaldTrump .
Also @realDonaldTrump you realize creating a space force is illegal? Look into the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. @KellyannePolls you need to advise this #IdiotInChief before he speaks. #FUCKTRUMP #MoronInChief #Dotard
