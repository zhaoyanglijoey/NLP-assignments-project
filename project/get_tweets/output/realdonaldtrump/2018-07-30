@SandraSmithFox did I hear Kurtz defend the media for screaming, screeching, and shouting questions and insults at @realDonaldTrump esp when Trump has a foreign leader with him? Kurtz thinks its Okay?
@cia @realDonaldTrump
@rushlimbaugh @realDonaldTrump How about we demand that the drive by media (the 4th branch) recuse itself on all matters involving Trump. #No4thBranch Truth and nothing but the truth should be the news.
I give a damn to what your so called strategist says ! I believe meeting with Putin assures people that we have a wise person in WH and not a moron like Odumbya who was ridiculing Putin as boy in the back seat ! @realDonaldTrump has more support than u can think !

Because reporters love to only hear what they want to hear. I have heard @FoxNews do it time and again. Just like witch hunt. Hunting Russians is not a witch hunt. Hunting @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is a witch hunt. Mueller is hunting our President and his team. #WitchHunt FBI spied
@realDonaldTrump You dick!
You and @realDonaldTrump are responsible for enabling the people who did this. Without you and his consent they wouldn't have been so emboldened to publicly expouse their racism.

@nytimes , reporting on @POTUS & @stevenmnuchin1 's capital gains tax plan, tells us the Wharton School of Business says indexing capital gains to inflation reduces gov revenue $102 bn over 10 yrs, enriching the top 1%. But @Wharton 's probably full of it, right @realDonaldTrump ?
@realDonaldTrump promised it would be built by Mexico. Instead he cuts programs like CHIP, which provides health insurance for underprivileged children, to pay for a wall that will be torn down in celebration by the next generation...

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump With the number of minorities who've been fined, arrested, jailed, and harassed for cannabis use and possession, the US is continuing Anslinger's crusade. Millions of people have criminal records. And Sessions is the new Anslinger. #EndTheProhibition #MAGA
And they laugh all the way to the Bank. How much has Daddy had the Secret Service pay for golf cart rentals at his own golf course. Again, Daddy laughing all the way to the Bank. @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
Just to be clear, fat-ass @realDonaldTrump is proposing a 2nd tax cut for wealthy although already historic income inequality gap and wage growth of -1.8% vs prior year.
I love that @realDonaldTrump s lickspittles never argue that he did nothing wrong - merely that potential witnesses don't know anything about it
Yeah...Ok, I am not a #TomBrady fan but I do know he is a true #Christian &, undoubtedly, he knows @IvankaTrump is, by no means, a #GodlyWoman . Nor is any member or that family any kind of #Christian . @realDonaldTrump sold his soul to #Satan & Ivanka converted to Jew for Jared.

@realDonaldTrump Great idea. Hold a rally in Mexico City. You might convince them to fund your wall ... like you promised.
High money supply, high consumption, increasing inflation, increased build up of cold meats, goods (reciprical tariffs, less demand overseas) etc... the US is becoming overheated. To cool it... @realDonaldTrump might take a page out of Jackson. #Comingfreedom ?

@realDonaldTrump "witch-hunt, witch-hunt, witch-hunt". #KristenBell 'Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit". How many witch-hunts can a witch-hunt hunt before a witch-hunt finds a big ole #Orangeheaded lying treasonous phoney president and prosecutes him to the fullest extent of the law?
