So does @realDonaldTrump 's tough talk about bump stocks really represent a stand against gun lunacy? Nah. It''s the only gun legislation the NRA supports, & the anti-bump stock campaign is bs in an of itself, as this report by @RVAwonk made clear last year http:// bit.ly/2FiO6vg
@BretBaier Thanks for the update on Charles @krauthammer ! He is in my prayers and thoughts.I cannot wait to tweet him in disagreement, politely regarding @realDonaldTrump .
Please @realDonaldTrump , please join your supporters and start feuding with the kids down in Florida. You know you want to. It's a really good idea, trust me.
Record temps in the East, but in typical fashion @realDonaldTrump hasn't said anything about global warming. #confirmationbias
@realDonaldTrump - No federal gun law would've stopped this mass shooting and Democrats know that. #2A - "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!

You may just have to file this under "nunna dis matters" if @realDonaldTrump keeps pushing gun control and doesn't build the wall.
@realDonaldTrump is a hypocrite. He is also a suspect to be compromised . He is in the hip pocket of Putin. He has been described as treasonous. Five I's need to come toward him. Investigation, Interrogate him, Indict him and others, Impeach and Incarcerate him.
@realDonaldTrump I am stick & tired of liberals & ugly obama throwing white people under the bus. White people need to start sticking together because the blacks stand with blacks, muslims for muslims & Mexicans for Mexicans. Whites stand with your white self.

@NRA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS buying automatic weapons must have 30 day check with FBI and Police - no person can just walk in and buy automatic immediatly plus not to be sold to people under 25 years old. Not taking anyone's rights away just being more careful.
@SenatorCollins @leonpanetta wonders on CNN if @realDonaldTrump is keeping his oath of office. Is he just a party hack or a dedicated public servant and truth teller?

No. Arming teachers is a non-starter, @realDonaldTrump . We want solutions, not scams that funnel public education money to gun manufacturers.
@realDonaldTrump so if arming teachers is the solution to a school shooting, doesn't that mean that the solution to a school fire is for teachers to light another fire?
Only a total #trumphole would need to be reminded to hear people. Shallow agenda for a shallow man. #illegitimateDon @realDonaldTrump Trump's note card for Parkland shooting discussion: 'I hear you' @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2ETNT49
Horrible enough to put black children in classrooms with racist teachers, but giving those racists the right to show up armed and threaten those children is high up on the white supremacists wishlist. So of course @realDonaldTrump and @GOP are all for it.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Nicole Hockley from S-Hook was not practical. yes, they have done things BUT there are ppl not going to school, hooked on opiods,gangs etc. They could head toward the school to harm. Secure the schools-more than 1 guard. Retired Mid-age vets-employ them!!
@realdonaldtrump didn't lie this time. He literally did 'hear' them but we know he and the #GOP will wait out this news cycle and nothing will change. Thankfully, things are changing at many state levels & I welcome all those awesome teens to the Democratic party. #VoteBlue
Honestly, @realDonaldTrump is a complete idiot, who in their right mind would think that more guns is the solution. So teachers won't try to protect the children, instead children will try to dodge not only the bullets from the shooter, but bullets from the teachers guns as well.
Who the fuck needs "Cliff's Notes" to convey compassion, empathy, and decency??? Ahhhhh.... yes, @realDonaldTrump does. #CliffNotes #CribSheet #Dotard
The teenagers held their own without notes ... @realDonaldTrump needs to be coached
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I propose armed security at schools perhaps some retired vets or police. Every professional building in NYC has a guard who meets you when you enter. I would give Police the right to stop and frisk also.
And, I can recall several teachers I wouldn't want handling a sharp object!!! @realDonaldTrump negotiates a way with #GOP and #NRA to increase the revenue to offset Congress increasing the age from 18-21. Genius. #GunControlNow #NeverAgainMSD

@realDonaldTrump I would expect you to feel even more so about our own Country's children who are being gunned down at schools. Proper response would be: Ban AR's. These are weapons of war. No one needs them outside of the military.

@realDonaldTrump It is your obligation and duty to investigate and prosecute those behind the shootings . Florida shooter wanted to be a professional shooter and walked out with students not expecting to die. Who employed him?

@Potus @realDonaldTrump Your answer to school massacre is to arm teachers & put more guns in schools. What does that say about our country & society? Instead of progressing, are we regressing to the Wild West with assault weapons? Is that your vision? #Trump #guns #Florida #GOP
i wish i had a dick, so i could tell @realDonaldTrump to suck it
See, @realDonaldTrump says something so incredibly tactless and stupid that were all laughing at that instead of focusing on the fact that these mass shootings are happening at an astonishing rate and @NRA is paying politicians to not do a thing.
Your #ListeningSession made U look like a bigger IDIOT than U already R @realDonaldTrump Just go away. How much can Americans PAY for @POTUS Trump to RESIGN quietly & go to Russia in exile
@realDonaldTrump why don't you use the National Guard to Monitor and keep our school safe Instead of weekend warrior Duty
President @realDonaldTrump @VP Pence thank you for having the #ListeningSession today while my heart broke for the kids, parents and families it was nice to see diverse ideas actually be listened too!
@realDonaldTrump I started my life out of High school starting to work on a man's security ward of a mental institution 1976.. Vo-tech senior yr a plus. After institutions shut down, I worked in group homes. Public safer with institutions, group home waste too much money.. #maga
No. 6 (continued on back): DO NOT say to mass shooting survivors "I guns because I have a tiny penis and that's how I compensate for teeny weeny." @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/uVyBJcRFLi
@realDonaldTrump will promote it as "win" for manufacturing: 3,200,000 full time public school teachers x average of $325 for a Glock 22...not to mention the cost of ammo and holsters. (ABSURD!)
@realDonaldTrump needs a note card to remind him to offer sympathy to hurting students. #NeverAgain #TrumpReality #AlternateReality #HumanNoMore #RussianBotIsOurPresident #RobotInTheWhiteHouse #ReprogramTheRobot #SystemFailure #Reboot #BlueScreen #NoOperatingSystem #InstallLinux

@realDonaldTrump . The shootings are because of kids just like the ones th@are preaching gloom and doom now.When I went to school we had shotguns and rifles hanging from gun racks N the parking lot.Kids gang mentality's the problem not the gun Don't be the POTUS th@changed the2A

MSM Media has no credibility after being willing participants in Hillary Clinton's and DNC's sinister scheme to influence an election and undermine @realDonaldTrump Presidency Now they use children as props. #Shameful #ParklandStudentsSpeak #CrisisActors
Who is @realDonaldTrump trying to appease...the victims or NRA. This cannot be POTUS
I am disgusted at the "solutions" that @realDonaldTrump concocted in his "remember to say I Hear You" session today. Teachers are paid educators, not assassins or security guards. Parents should not have to choose schools by their "impressive arsenals." #ParklandStudentsSpeak pic.twitter.com/yW9lUlInKp
So, in other words, you want guns in the classroom, despite saying that you didn't last year. Good talk, @realDonaldTrump .
For those critics of @realDonaldTrump when did 44 sit down and listen and talk w the victims looking for solutions and how to move forward? Your Trump Derangement Syndrome is showing, again.
So @realDonaldTrump is afraid of @Emma4Change . What a cravenly little worm of a man. #ListeningSession #GunReformNow
Good lord @realDonaldTrump - you need a note (clearly not in your handwriting) to remind you to listen?! Bwaaa haa haa! You need reminders for empathy? You are the leader of our nation? Come on man! @johncusack , @HamillHimself - please say something! pic.twitter.com/tPUn9APZ0F
@realDonaldTrump Today, once again, you proved you are not a stable genius but are a clueless moron. These Parkland students outshine your scripted (probably by your NRA donors) interaction. You truly are a Dotard. Please resign before you irreparably damage our country.
More guns to the situation surly creates more confusion! Who will know who the real person(s) are!!! @realDonaldTrump #ByeFelicia #Novice
@realDonaldTrump GET GUN LAWS CHANGED OR GET THE HELL OUT OF THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.
@realDonaldTrump Today is another day of sooooo many I am proud you are my President!
@realDonaldTrump why not require all gun sellers to post a bond. If they do not follow sales rules hit them where is hurts. In their pockets

The greatest way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump question....did you hear them? Or did you need to look at your notes to remind yourself?
@realDonaldTrump I watched Andrew Pollack's powerful plea for a change to protect the kids at school & he was right to focus on practical protection. Armed guards for every school in the land, adequately armed to halt any such attack..? It costs, but lives have no price.
Man @realDonaldTrump is a literal fucking moron

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump How much should we raise teachers salaries to compensate them the new risk and duties they are taking on?
@RealDonaldTrump : The NRA has a huge membership and can get involved in protecting school children. NRA Members could be Checked Out and Certified to be an "NRA School Protection Force" member. This would also help the NRA gain support and popularity with Liberals. @VP @GOP
@realDonaldTrump The fact that the last "note" is I hear you??? You need to remind yourself to make sure to make someone feel heard??? Its the fact that it wont come naturally, that gets me, others wrote that, and they knew you werent getting it

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @JesseBWatters Put bulletproof shields (like riot gear) in all classrooms. Teacher could approach an assailant. Rolling or strategic built-in pullout shields in hallways. Just thinking.
agree 100% is was painful for me to watch i wanted to hear those ppl but kust got more angry at every @realDonaldTrump "nuance" of disinterest.
The fact that @realDonaldTrump even thinks that arming teachers is a good idea is absolutely insane, wtf goes through your head??
@realDonaldTrump Are people really that ignorant? If there is any HOPE, it might be in me, OR then again it might not? Sir, I'm not out to convince anyone, 4 Years I gave Visions and 88% right... I tried to HELP my America... @toneantone96

@realDonaldTrump while arming teachers sounds great, you will have issues with that. The CA muslims shot people at workplace. Put the retired & qualified vets to work.
Idiot @realDonaldTrump : If your answer to this Listening Session is to arm teachers and turn schools into prisons, children will just not be going to school.
So why was he and Emma Gonzalez not at the meeting today with the President if they are so passionate about the President making changes in Gun Laws and showing the public that they are real students at Parkland? @Potus @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump suggests arming teachers ! Has he even consulted with teachers unions ? I have never heard a more ludicrous idea to REDUCE gun violence. There could be gun fights in elementary schools. Around panicked kids and other adults. The man has a brain the size of a pea
@realDonaldTrump Sorry for the kids, but kids who have never read the Constitution, have never supported themselves, or lived on their own, along with didn't warn a single adult of what the shooter was capable of, are NOT capable of making Constitution changing decisions! #MAGA pic.twitter.com/Co8TzrWH8v

Teachers don't even get enough funding for school supplies and you now expect to get funding for arming teachers ?! How much money did the #NRA pay you to come up with that solution @realDonaldTrump ?
There need to be an stop to school shooting they're kids dropping dead because there some crazy peoole who is not aloud to have a gun that person can be mental. There should have police officer at school to protect those mother and father and staff @realDonaldTrump

#teachersagainstguns I will never have a firearm in my classroom, but I will always teach, care, learn and protect pupils from all violence. @realDonaldTrump do not arm teachers, disarm teenagers or step down in disgrace.
@realDonaldTrump ok, arm the teachers. In the future though, how many cases of teachers snapping and shooting their students will it take to remove guns from teachers? #NoMore #neveragainmovement #GunControlWorks @AriMelber @Morning_Joe
@realDonaldTrump is a dip shit
@realDonaldTrump Arming teachers is not the answer. More guns lead to more deaths. We already have 300 million guns in this country. We need to address the lax gun safety laws, a weak gun registration system, need for research, and mushrooming sales of military assault weapons.
@realDonaldTrump You have to be one of the stupidest bastards on earth. How the hell can you call for arming teaches and janitors. Are you not listening. These kids don't want guns in their fucking schoolos you piece of shit.

@realDonaldTrump
God forbid id Trump wasn't shielded from reality or possessed an ounce of empathy. Between his little javanka notes and his @NRA coaching, this whole meet-n-greet was a sham. @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @PressSec You guys are a joke.
Why 45 on his sleeve? Because it is all about @realDonaldTrump and his huge ego!
What? You want to arm our teachers with guns? Are they going to be Rambo Teacher with an assault rifle or a gun that shoots off a few rounds? Don't forget that the killer is armed with an assault rifle that shoots off 30+ rounds or 100 rounds. What's the point? @realDonaldTrump
It's shameful that @realDonaldTrump pushed #nralies that arming teachers would stop other attacks. He's so full of shit. Teachers would have their hands full just keeping students safe. There is ZERO proof that would have stopped this or any attack. And probably more people die.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump please put Bibles back in schools, this will help stop these murders, along with arming school personal. When the goodness of GOD was taken so was values of our people. Thank you for being a great president, you have the guts to get things done.
@FLOTUS dear @realDonaldTrump - I thought you might benefit from seeing what EMPATHY looks like. This is @POTUS44 with the siblings of students killed in Sandy Hook two days after the shooting.

A voice of "moderation" he would not be. A force to push the anti-American progressive, communist agenda he would be. He needs defeated. @realDonaldTrump fails us in his indorsement of @MittRomney as he fails is in not pursuing the prosecution of @HillaryClinton @cspanwj

Actually Bill Gates is one of the most generous billionaires there is. His wife Melinda and him donate millions. Try and find any donations in the millions that @realDonaldTrump actually donated to. Not promised and didn't follow through....but actually gave!!!!
@realDonaldTrump If schools are ever NOT considered gun free zones, there's going to be a massive jump in homeschooling. I'd rather have a child that may not be as educated, rather than a dead one.

@realDonaldTrump So take the $500M to fund Planned Parenthood and pay ready-trained veterans to protect the schools. Problem solved. But I get the impression Liberals, including this student mouthpiece, aren't looking for solutions.

@realDonaldTrump rather than supporting more guns, lets discuss all options privately..give the public a window of a plan.. day to day updates only adds confusion.. also lets think out of the box... an idea i have... simple quick and will support all sides...
A trained resource deputy wouldn't go in to try to save lives @realDonaldTrump but we should arm teachers.
@realDonaldTrump Presidents don't make history; they rise to the occasion when defining moments present themselves. This is your moment. You have the chance to go down in history as the president who made the country safe again by brokering common-sense gun laws. Don't f-up.
I doubt Obama has the significant number of bad hair days that @realDonaldTrump tries to hide with his stupid hats. Plus Obama didn't promote products he was buying from China for $.25 and reselling to suckers for $40.00.

@realDonaldTrump sadly we do have these drills.
@realDonaldTrump now supports some gun control. Why do news organizations fixate on the friction this will cause with the #NRA , and not acknowledge his willingness to evolve his position?
@realDonaldTrump More than 300 million guns in the U.S. An "assault weapon" ban would be useless and an all out gun confiscation like the left is leaning to would be a disaster.

@realDonaldTrump This is not an issue of age, guns, NRA, or military service. It is a failure of GOVERNMENT. A 2013 amendment to NICS Act failed (before the last presidential election) that would have closed gaps in the system, 48-52. Guess who voted against it. DEMOCRATS.
