. @realDonaldTrump No DACA amnesty for enforcement only! Before any amnesty for DACA recipients, Congress must end Chain Migration & the Visa Lottery and require all employers to use E-Verify for new hires.
@realDonaldTrump Oprah Winfrey is a blind fanatic for Obama and Michelle. She would be his puppet POTUS. Obama would end MAGA, MASA, jobs, reimpose regs, give Hillary and Bill pardons and jobs, flood sanctuary America with illegals rapists gangs, Islamist Jihadists like Europe.
@realDonaldTrump You and steve bannon are having a lovers quarrel , I can heal all problems and silence his books and no one else you know can do this
@realDonaldTrump you legalize marajuana in the U.S, you would make so many people happy
@realdonaldtrump congrats on being the least popular president ever! 54.297 = disaproval rate #LOSER
The media is silent on anything good done by @realDonaldTrump
And yet @realDonaldTrump doesn't give two shits what @JustinTrudeau thinks.
@realDonaldTrump Why are you betraying us?????
Idk how I feel about @Oprah for President, but anybody better than the fucking idiot we have now so she has my vote. Oh she wld so beat you @realDonaldTrump & it wouldn't even be close assuming you not in Jail by then..
. @realDonaldTrump Congress tried amnesty before enforcement in 1986 and it failed. No talk of DACA amnesty before ending Chain Migration and the Visa Lottery and mandating E-Verify. Most Americans agree!
@realDonaldTrump "I'd look at her right in that fat, ugly face of hers, I'd say 'Rosie, you're fired.'"
@realDonaldTrump I trusted you. You broke my heart today. No DACA - deport them. Build the wall. End chain migration and the lottery. Mandate e-verify.
? DId I get this right - Illegal immigration cost 183 billion per year - that is $ 560 per US citizen? @realDonaldTrump - my family would save over $ 2000.00 per year
@realDonaldTrump Thank you.

@realDonaldTrump I don't understand what the Democrats think is my incentive to want DACA - bankroll a bunch more illegals? Pad voter rolls w/Democrats? Push myself even closer to bankruptcy than I am now?

@realDonaldTrump Legalize DACA=Watch "TROY". I'm not against people who came here through a legal way, applied for the paper!. But if you crossed the border, bring your kids w/you, break the law, & expecting welfare&citizen later. Wrong!
Until mandatory @EVerify is implemented and enforced, the magnet of illegal immigration will never stop. Democrats want new voters and @GOP want to keep their masters at the @USChamber Commerce happy. @SenTomCotton @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump NO DACA. Build the wall. No Amnesty. No lottery. No chain migration. Build the wall. Lying Dems will never keep their promises. They promised a wall to Reagan. They promised to fund a wall--700 miles--43 miles completed. They do not keep their promises.
@realDonaldTrump is a pure genius. Letting the cameras roll while showing the pure partisanship of the democrats. The only thing the libshits kept saying was clean #Daca bill. Lmmfao you dumb ass liberals the American people see what your up to. #Amnesty for den voters. #NoDeal

I can't believe I just heard @realDonaldTrump make an appeal to bi-partisan cooperation,: "I'm appealing to everyone in the room to put the country before party." A far better idea would be for Trump worshipping Republicans to put the country before the "president."
