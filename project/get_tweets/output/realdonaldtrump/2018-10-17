@realDonaldTrump The head of forensic evidence in the Saudi general security department, Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, was among a 15-man squad who arrived in Turkey earlier that day by private jet.
Rise again in market does not serve the MSM narrative of that @realDonaldTrump is making the sky fall down somehow. Meanwhile, DJT is setting up FedRes as fall guy to take it out, zero out odious debt, and return control of currency to the Constitutional authority of Congress.

@realDonaldTrump you will likely need to do an executive order to change immigration laws! You may have to do that to get all the money for the wall! Disgusting ryan and mcconnell! What they have done is sedition against us! We voted 4 the damn wall, they stopped it!
@StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Now that is true.
You must mean million dollars of blood money from Mister Bone Saw to keep @realDonaldTrump defending the Saudis butchering of Khashoggi. The USA is for sale to the highest $ to #TrumpCrimeFamily Right @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump #TrumpGrifters

"Sources with knowledge". Any NY "News" agency is Fake News. The FBI ought to clean it's own filthy house before worrying about leaking stories to NY "newspapers." @realDonaldTrump
@washingtonpost says some "good" thing happened despite this other, unrelated thing that is "bad." Will they do this in reverse? For example, "We don't like @realDonaldTrump 's handling of X, but we have to admit the economy is doing great." Guessing no. Funny how that works.

@realDonaldTrump can cut off funding to a country. He cannot re-direct the money to build the wall. That idea is illegal, since only Congress has the power to fund the wall. It sounds good to say things like that on TV, but it is not practical. Sorry, I wish it were possible.
All the TRUMPS are DIMWITS! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
