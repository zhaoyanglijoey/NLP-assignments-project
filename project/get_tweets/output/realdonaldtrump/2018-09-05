And @FoxNews is reporting that @realDonaldTrump has told NYT if the Anonymous person is real....they need to turn them over to the White House immediately....and fast fade to Kaepernick ....of course
I wonder when the left will realize that we knew we were voting for a business man, not a politician? We've been getting screwed for many years. That why @realDonaldTrump won. To #DrainTheSwamp and call out the corrupt media. I guess some are too blind to see. #
If the book was full of lies and fabrications, there are legal routes @realDonaldTrump could take. The problem is, Bob is an impeccable journalist, and likely has recordings and witnesses to every conversation, and they would lose... every... single... time
Yeah, that's not how that works. But keep trying sparky. @realDonaldTrump is a spineless, guttless, destructive lumatic. 25th amendment now! Put country become party and remove this disastrous dictator. #25thAmendment #25thAmendmentNow #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump pic.twitter.com/jj3D9kJVzI

Hey @realDonaldTrump We found who the WH source is that contributed to the NYT article!!!! @cnn @msnbc @maddow @Lawrence @ErinBurnett pic.twitter.com/kc1EdILf5g
@realDonaldTrump has proven to be the worst, most incompetent, dangerous and petulant POTUS in history, period...FULL STOP! @GOP & @HouseGOP are complicit and totally worthless! I applaud this person for sounding the alarm! We're in danger!!
Now I know you don't know what you are talking about. They are not under investigation. @realDonaldTrump is. Why do you think he is under investigation? You are a traitor supporting a traitor. It's that simple.
@realdonaldtrump . Not that you'd understand but for your education. "To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker."Frederick Douglass. Remember learning a little about him? Last year? Yea. That was nice.

hard to tell whether @realDonaldTrump is stupid enough to believe, knows his supporters are stupid enough to believe it, or simple so insecure he has to put forward this absurd and transparent lie
@realDonaldTrump Isn't it a shame someone can buy a building, charge people tens of thousands of dollars to attend, call it a university, and teach them nothing?
Liddle Twit @realDonaldTrump lies now number more than 6,000 (confirmed) since the 2016 campaign, increasing every day. pic.twitter.com/RtdyRKVnf2
@realDonaldTrump HA,HA,HA,HA, YOU STUPID FUCKIN IDIOT! FINALLY, THE TRUTH, THAT WE ALL ALREADY KNEW IS COMING OUT........... #UNHINGED
@realDonaldTrump I leaked the op-ed to the @nytimes I forgot, you don't have any black Sr. staffers
Watching @realDonaldTrump go absolutely bananas insane crazy the past couple days is both very entertaining and horrifyingly sad for the long term outlook for the country./ So gross that, as a nation, we've been reduced to this. #NYTimes #Pence #KavanaughHearings #SCOTUS #25th
Commander Queeg @realDonaldTrump is at it again!
No @realDonaldTrump , the press, under the 1st Amendment to Our Constitution has the right to protect their sources. You really should try reading the United States Constitution or have someone read it to you. You just might learn something, or not! #SAD
As am I! And more so than ever now that @realDonaldTrump decided he would go off the cliff & announce he would like to make it illegal to #Protest . Making it official that he is willing to #TakeApartTheConstitution & #DenyAmericansRights afforded therein. Veterans defend rights.
The book is a lie. And the American people who stand for America know it. They're trying to isolate @realdonaldtrump . They can't isolate 63+m Americans from him MAGA VoteRed2018
@realDonaldTrump the Trump presidency is Unraveling like a cheap sweater Fun to watch!!!!
What @realDonaldTrump needs to immediately do is polygraph his immediate circle to see if anyone gave info to the @nytimes .
@realDonaldTrump the Senior Administrative Official has staged a coup and must invoke the 25th Amendment or prolong a Constitutional Crisis and cause a National Security Crisis. What are the Chinese and the Russians doing. How are our allies behaving now. What will the Markets do
So true !! Time to pass #HR392 #Passhr392now @RepKevinYoder @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump #baby , if you lash it out learn to take the truth like a man
@LouDobbs ..,REFRESH AMERICA ABOUT THE REPORT YOU DID ABOUT 20yrs AGO..,DEALING WITH THE NEW WORLD ORDER (NAFTA) THE DESOLATION OF AMERICA BORDERS....,THEN THE GENERATION OF SNOWFLAKES WILL UNDERSTAND WHY @realDonaldTrump is @POTUS . ..,EDUCATION IS REQUIRED..ASAP !! pic.twitter.com/qxwfz1KzX4
"This coward should do the right thing and resign." @PressSec has some harsh words for @realDonaldTrump . I think he should listen to her.
@realDonaldTrump For National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once! And what would you do to a person who maybe telling the truth? What other dictators do to their political enemies?
@realDonaldTrump hahahah dumb southerner. You're so stupid that you dont see the damage you're inflicting on your own party. Yea you are a complete dumb fuck. Once you're impeached I'll be happy to fuck your wife and daughter & kick your kids out
What a BS witch hunt and I am paying for this idiot!!!! It's sessions fault. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani @USAGSessions
@realDonaldTrump . This is also my response!! pic.twitter.com/dcyhdlOZhd
Calling it now, Putin is the senior advisor to @realDonaldTrump that the NYT sources.
@realDonaldTrump how do you now the coward behind NYT op-ed isn't ivanka, or sanders ... or even pence he might be after your job
Bet it is Pence. yRump you are going to flip your lid when you find out. Maybe we can be lucky and you have eaten just enough kFC to have the big one @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I bet Sessions is the culprit! What do you think?? Joe... DiGenova! Please hire him!
@realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @dbongino @RealCandaceO @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr @DevinNunes @SenTedCruz Y'all should ask @jack about these!
@realDonaldTrump - New SCOTUS justice confirmation next week. Done deal. Get your 3rd pick ready. Worst SCOTUS justice in history - Ginsberg - will be next replaced. The disgrace to the court can't even stay awake long enough to do her job, and ignores the Constitution when awake
@realDonaldTrump is an unruly child. Even though his turn is over he refuses to give up the @Nintendo controller. He will destroy the system so nobody else can enjoy it before he is forcefully removed and placed in time out. #timesup #TickTock
@realDonaldTrump - you cannot stop the leaking. You are an old 71 after all, getting older by the hour, even if your fake hair lies to you. #MuellerIsComingForYou
