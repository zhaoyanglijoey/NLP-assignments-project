Even if we forego the obvious jokes, I can't imagine what Stormy will be "handing out" at the border! I'm sure it was the brainchild of that "braintrust," @MichaelAvenatti He prostitutes himself so much, I forget who's in what business! @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @LouDobbs
I hate you @realDonaldTrump
Chicken or egg - did they become a @realDonaldTrump staffer because everyone hates them or does everyone hate them because they are a trump staffer. Mysteries of the Univeese
@realDonaldTrump Cynthia Nixon An actress running for Governor of New York Dem Actually showed her mentality and I sure hope no one votes for her Said that ICE is a terrorist organization! What the?? Is she mentally challenged? ICE is doing their job to protect US
Fixed it for you, your welcome. "Losing the House might help @realDonaldTrump be held accountable for his failures"
@realDonaldTrump please stop all financial sent to Mexico. @DonaldJTrumpJr
Their mutual pain over this is beyond heartbreaking. And, this was COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS
Have you NO shame? @realDonaldTrump
I like this much better @FLOTUS and @realDonaldTrump ! This has way more class! pic.twitter.com/5J78ZuvCQ4
Ha, good one! If @GOP loses the house, @realDonaldTrump gets impeached Big League. And #DonaldTrump will undoubtably 100% go to jail since there will be no one to protect him from his numerous obvious crimes.
Your #TrumpCamps @realDonaldTrump
I just hope @realDonaldTrump is keeping an eye on this #Criminal
It's not only compassion. There are smart ways of doing things and there are dumb ways of doing things. The way @realDonaldTrump has chosen is immoral, incredibly expensive, and has failed.
What part? Just asking- hey @TheJusticeDept @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump are there any other religious groups other then Catholics that you are allowing to help the children you have KID-napped? @IslamicRelief @TheJewishMuseum
#stopmandatorysentencing @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @common @RickRoss @SnoopDogg @LilKim @kanyewest @KimKardashian please be a voice help these men and women get a fair shake... Dont just stand by... please make some noise
Well, @SpeakerRyan is a traitor who kept it secret w his republican "family" that @realDonaldTrump is paid by putin. Sounds like a traitor to America.
So where was all the outrage during the previous administrations when they put those kids in cages? And trafficked them off? "Crickets".. So spare the fake "outrage" for someone who cares. The left is only mad because they can't puppet @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS .
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, why not punishing those countries who do nothing to protect their citizens? If you cannot passed legislation on immigration due to the Democratic obstructionism, then target those countries responsible for affecting our nation!
parliament in chaos over tommy robinson https:// youtu.be/503XLFQDuVU via @YouTube You will love this! #QANON #WWG1WGA @realDonaldTrump
Just saw that got the dude who shot Xxx .now lets see if @realDonaldTrump gives back kids locked in a cage
@realDonaldTrump why would you move these illegals from where they are in now. MOVING THEM TO BASES IN ALABAMA, ETC SIMPLY JUST GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO GET LOOSE AND DISAPPEAR. MOVE THEM BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. YOU ARE SUPPORTING OPEN BORDERS.
@realDonaldTrump There should've been a set income amount for those having to charge taxes on the internet sites such as ebay. Maybe , like those earning $20,000 or more. Many people sell used items, too. How many damn times can you keep taxing used items?
@realDonaldTrump "These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones...not for a day or 2 days, they are permanently separated," Those who lost family members to *crimes committed by Born And Raised US Citizens*, due to gun laws YOU refuse to change. pic.twitter.com/68QunEbGza
Would like to see a tracking of how many of this group contributed to the personal fortunes of @realDonaldTrump along the way. He recognizes more than anyone that there is a welcome place in America for the contributions of so many who don't have the choices the rest of us have.
@realDonaldTrump Please continue to serve the American people. No DACA, no amnesty. Pls do not cave to Ryan's bill. MAGA #NoRyanAmnestyBill #AmericaFirst

Man, fuck you, @realDonaldTrump . Piece of shit.
@realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter where you put the children. If you keep stealing the families are going to come for you, and everyone involved. And we won't be sitting idly by. You will not be allowed to turn America into Nazi Germany.
They're planning to protest Baron's school. See, they're HARRASSING children in order to END THE ABUSE OF CHILDREN. Make sense?

@realDonaldTrump I have a great idea Mr. President give Amnesty to all these illegals and make them sign a contract saying that they will register as Republicans and only vote Republican and if they vote anything else they go to prison
@realDonaldTrump @vp @PressSec @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @FoxNews @AP @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews Talk about the WHITE criminals on the TX Borders!!! Drug dealers servicing drug addicted Americans for decades!! Stop blaming people of color! Ignorant fools! pic.twitter.com/3Mfy6RMALh
All this behavior from democrats should be seen as domestic terrorism. They are trying to turn everyone against @realDonaldTrump Its treason. They should be in prison.
As Rush said so eloquently ..I enjoy envisioning the media elites when they think they have backed @realDonaldTrump into a corner and then their minds exploding as they realize that it is all coming back on them!
Immigration resolution: 1. Prove citizenship to work ( e-verify) 2. Prove citizenship to receive cash, food stamps, medical benefits 3. Make it illegal for non citizens to send money via wire transfer. 4. Prove citizenship to enrolled in schools @realDonaldTrump
I love our President @realDonaldTrump , but, he has made some serious errors in judgement in replacing the D.C. screw ups ... Way too trusting....
@realDonaldTrump It is sad whenever there is violence and criminals must be brought to justice whether they are immigrants or citizens. However that does not mean that they need to be persecuted as a collective and their kids separated from parents in such a inhuman manner.
TRUMP, critiquer pour la separation des enfants de leurs parents, Que sont ces parents qui imposent cela a leurs gosses ?? La dissuasion est a la hauteur des enjeux. En 2016 Obama a fait pareil, vous en avez entendu parler ? @TrumpFrance @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/iWJfv7iWPJ

Thank you for your time I would want to make you a business proposition. Specifically about investing in EXTIL ADIEL in developing a luxury automated vacation home condos, with retail stores for international fashion brands and a world class restaurant. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Do you really think that drugs are brought over by individuals crossing the border? No they are brought over by corrupt DEA agents who have been paid off by the Mexican cartels and they are brought over by the ton.
#BokoHaram and @realDonaldTrump are good at kidnapping girls it seems
Very sad. And @realDonaldTrump @GOP @VP are evil to use them for political means. What about the school shootings, church shootings, concert shootings, domestic violence all done by AMERICAN citizens? Where are the angel families. You all are disgusting. PERIOD
Imagine if @BarackObama did half the shit @realDonaldTrump does
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump I feel like we are going to get screwed with the reciprocal tariffs if NAFTA remains. For example, companies will simply ship to Mexico/Canada, and then into the US. They will still charge us to export though, and tip the scale doubly. NAFTA has to go.
TMW you finally see some of your #Republican friends start to acknowledge how awful @realDonaldTrump is. #AboutTime
Some days I imagine you will show up and defeat Vader I mean @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump PLEASE do not keep the illegal families until Nov. By then they will be in our country. Don't you see what the thugs in Wash are doing? always stalling. Trump supporters are demanding a halt to immigration now-not tomorrow-not next month-but now. Fine Mexico!
Lol...right? I just noticed my pool filter is made in Mexico. Now...really America cant make pool filters? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump you're meeting with families who have had relatives killed by immigrants? What about the black families who have had relatives killed by cops???
@realDonaldTrump
I've never heard @maddow show any outrage over American Children being murdered by illegals but she was outraged that @realdonaldtrump didn't hand over his Tax Returns. You should examine the soul and character of every source.
@realDonaldTrump Cramer's game plan: If you can't handle more combative Trump tweets, raise cash https:// cnb.cx/2MgaHuJ Again, well done, Cheeto. Guess it's true you didn't do well with those courses at Wharton.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Ahh yes, the pious one #JoeSellout . The one who was kissing @realDonaldTrump rear end to have him on your show until he talked bad about your then mistress turned girlfriend/wife Mika. Hypocrisy is the very root of your show.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President I would love to see the United States Of America build a new Battleship to the likes of the USS Missouri " Mighty Mo " And found a naming commission so we can properly name her
@realDonaldTrump spent the day exploiting and autographing portraits of citizens killed by the minority of people crossing the border. And you call this shameful? Trumps agenda to demonize an entire region of people (just like Hitler) is shameful.

Why Trump's Space Force is important: Both the Airforce and NASA use up big chunks of their budget doing "space force" stuff. Now, they both can be more effective by being more focused. Makes sense to me. #MAGA #KAG #SpaceForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @Potus
