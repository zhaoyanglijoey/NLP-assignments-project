1) It's not a foregone conclusion that Congress would've had the votes to override. Some whip counts say no such possibility. 2) Media beating @realDonaldTrump over the head w/it? So what? Instead we get 72 hours of Gun Control, followed by porn stars /1
Because @realDonaldTrump is a lazy, unintelligent, child who only knows what he sees on TV. How disgusting for America.
And this is not something any president especially @realDonaldTrump would want to shine a light on. #WeThePeople must trust President Trump. We elected him & dumped him in the middle of a long established evil corrupt swamp. Time is needed to #DrainTheSwamp #TrustThePlan
Bored sooooo....this happened. My view of @realDonaldTrump presidency depicted using emojis pic.twitter.com/beJab15zqS
@realDonaldTrump If they are cheating then don't sign it.
@realDonaldTrump of course you also kept planned parenthood funded how democratic of you .. You promised your fans you'd defund Planned parenthood yet you just funded them you're nothing but a liar meh I'm preaching to the choir saying that #resign #Notafan
Let's have accountability, shadow government, rogue CIA NOT USA MILITARY ATTACKING IN MID EAST. THEY ARE THE ONES CREATING WARS AND WE PAY THEM TO DO IT. RESEARCH. @realDonaldTrump @USDoDGov .What is SES?

So @realDonaldTrump had to do the walk of shame again up the backdoor of Airforce one
@realDonaldTrump , why you surround yourself with war hawks & liars?! SPECIAL REPORT: Bolton To The #WhiteHouse - Pre-Emptive #War On The Way? https:// youtu.be/h3mmyBFXUFw via @YouTube
@realDonaldTrump , in one fell swoop, you just broke every campaign promise for which I gave my vote.
@realDonaldTrump I am disappointed, but I will not turn my back on you.
@realDonaldTrump If you don't believe in something do something about it. Cut off all members of congress until they come together and submit a proper bill that isn't full of trade offs. Make them earn the money being given to them.
@realDonaldTrump I voted for a change in the way Washington works. You were supposed to change things. You let me down. I had and still have the first Trump sign in Southeast Louisiana. You should never have signed that monstrosity. Ryan and McConnel screwed you. Bad move.
@realDonaldTrump if you are going to ban #bumpstocks then you need to ban all belts and trigger fingers because you can achieve the same results with those as you can with the evil bump stock.
What gives Ann... I don't understand why someone as smart as you, believes our guy, President Trump has a magic wand or controls everything in DC. That way of thinking isn't so smart ...right? @realDonaldTrump can't do this alone - yet everyone expects him to. #MAGA ...breathe
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is so much smarter than any of you whiny spineless fake Trump supporters! Read this! And then We all expect an apology to @POTUS pic.twitter.com/iAMDfGVyl1

not voting in midterms now... who cares now? great job @realDonaldTrump you screwed it all up... irredeemably go dems #2018 !!!
I'm dead serious,it might take us a little longer,have to work a little harder,sacrifice a little more,but it would give myself purpose & maybe it would many others also,something I sure would be proud of participating in. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #Trump #Trump2020 #BuildThatWall
So this is odd... I was typing the phrase 'Reported them' while texting my cousin, and before I hit send I noticed my auto-correct changed it to 'Deported them'. Looks like our phones are finally synced up with the mind of @realDonaldTrump .
There comes a point where every single tweet from @realDonaldTrump & @PressSec - no matter how emphatic - must be viewed as suspect and future #FakeNews . #contradictions #FlipFlops
@realDonaldTrump Buckle Up The Left &Most Of The Right Want You To Lose The #Majority So They Can Resume Stealing From #WeThePeople We Will Do Our Part, But Heads Up Mr President, Watch Them All. Ryan & McConnell Just Gave The First Blow, A Big One.
@realDonaldTrump is it true liberal Gen Mattis one who you let set you up w McConnell and Ryan?
1.5trillion & @potus couldn't get $25b 4 the wall from these corrupt @GOP scumbags. Will cost them the interim elections. @realDonaldTrump

Trump easily had the political capital with me too . He has done a lot I thought I would never see . Remember how we always paid for border enforcement the POTUS decided how to use , not deportation . @realDonaldTrump still far from the danger zone of my trust , he's earned it.
Correction. When every state goes blue. Blame the fraud that is @realDonaldTrump for it.
YEP! When Liberals Said There Won't Be A Damned WALL, They Meant It!! @realDonaldTrump
Great thread. Thank you. My support for @realDonaldTrump will not waiver. I knew draining the swamp would not be easy. He has done so much for us already.
So @realDonaldTrump decisions that pertain to our lives r competing w/his vacation time at Mar-a-lago. Great we can't compete w/the golfing. We take second on that priority list. Good to know how we rate. @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP how much longer do we tolerate this abuse of office.
@GeorgeWill Your comment today on MSNBC lumping the youth of today with @realDonaldTrump is not only ridiculous, but should afford an apology from you to them.
@westpointwife I agree @realdonaldtrump has 2look these parents in the eye when their kids r dying 2x as much in training accidents due to obsolescence, harsh conditions, constant war, cannabalized parts, sand,+ Obama Sequestration. Neither Gen Mattis or our C-I-C can live w that
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @SaraCarterDC @POTUS is not taking into account when he said will never sign a bill like this again -that the DEMS & RHINOS dont plan on having him in the @WhiteHouse next year DEMS TAKE OVER @MIDTERM & IMPEACH HIM IF MUELLER DOES'T GET HIM 1st pic.twitter.com/EuxvO85nCm
@realDonaldTrump how is it I work all my life and I get fired cause I was sick I got my unemployment approved and after 6 months I get cut off unemployment and this state don't give one shit about me but will take care of other people in other countries
Take it easy @RealAlexJones . @realDonaldTrump has been the president for 14 months. The swamp has been the swamp for decades. He did this for the troops.
@Kindhearted2015 @DianeHelp4pets @mcicero10 @Iiwiis61 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan He is crashing the market , wtf..

I agree. I couldn't believe it. How can someone support @realDonaldTrump now? Rush said it best. Only Trump can separate his supporters from him. That happened today!

I hope both you & @SenToomey vote him down. Has he ever apologized for helping lead us into the disastrous, illegal Iraq War? I thought @realDonaldTrump opposed the Iraq War & now he's bringing in one of its prime cheerleaders? Michael Bolton - YES. John Bolton - NO!
Did any of those people who voted for #Trump actually think he was a faithful husband? #nonewshere #henno they all knew who they were voting for. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump every weekend your visiting your resorts and adding to your wealth.

. @realDonaldTrump Bro when you gonna talk about the sick stock market gains?
Because @realDonaldTrump tweeted, I just saved $[insert amount] for [insert your reason here]!

Face it donny @realDonaldTrump , u thought it was a good idea until the reality of the magnitude of this job kicks u in the mouth. Just quit.
@realDonaldTrump bill still funds Planned Parenthood! DEFUND PP! Why are we funding their criminal organization?
@realDonaldTrump I already realized that your CIA telepaths are here too. what prevents them from working to expel the telepaths iluminatis? always American abuse.
Congress made this bill. Trumps a threat to Leftist and THE GOP alike. @realDonaldTrump either signs it and pisses off the entire base OR veto and the following narrative is @realDonaldTrump Shutdown the Gov't and Hurt our Military. This was a loose loose for him.

Ok i'm over it now the bill .Iwon't let my support for POTUS waver but I could sure use some kind of victory maybe Hillary in jail would help @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Why didn't you stay in Washington for the march? Are you afraid of students?? You should be. They have more knowledge and class than you ever will!!
Is it safe to say that both Ryan and McConnell are traitors to the agenda of @realDonaldTrump ? Both of these a$$holes appear to be working diligently to thwart and oppose anything Trump is trying to do, especially immigration related.
I hope no one shows for this demented egomaniac. @realDonaldTrump has done damage that will take years to repair.

@realDonaldTrump You promised Mexico would pay for the wall. Mexico promised they would not. Mexico won this deal.
@realDonaldTrump you just lost me and the rest or your base! You lied about the wall and now you attack our #2A ! You will be impeached by the Dems now! @FoxNews @GOP
Not a good look for @realDonaldTrump all of his side chicks are going to the press and dropping a dime on him.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President. Now that u signed the worst budget bill in history. U need 2 make it uo to Americans. We now need 2 c Hillary and her gang indicted. U MUST DRAIN THE SWAMP. But with this Omnibus Bill, u paid 2 have more swamp creatures hired. WHY?
@realDonaldTrump You let us down today. We voted for you, put up with ridiculous tweets (ok, some were awesome), and stood our ground when the Dems and the R establishment attacked us... We deserve better than what you signed today.
Some of them were bots pretending to be giving up on POTUS. We stand with @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump is far better then anyone else. But it proves the crooks in DC will never allow Americans to win. We are their cash cows.
Ryan, Pelosi, Schumer, and McConnell - Obama All Rolled Into One! @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @MSNBC @nypost @nytimes @CNN @ABC @CBS @NPR
Instead of blaming @realDonaldTrump , why don't you have the two snakes, @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr , and have them explain why they only met with @SenSchumer and @NancyPelosi to write this?
@realDonaldTrump approves of this opinion. #WhiteMustache #Resist pic.twitter.com/x1xxsG2JfJ
unless you @realDonaldTrump can fix something before the fall, I think you killed the Nov elections, Sir. I also think you may have killed your re election. May wanna look into what happens when a president's impeached.
@realDonaldTrump is the best chance we have had in our lifetimes to set things right. Understand he works with Military Intelligence and knows far more than any of http:// us.How many times have we seen him burn the left with their own tricks? Have a little faith people!
Thanks to Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and @realDonaldTrump , we have great celebrations by Democrats today. With slimeball Chuck Schumer actually proclaiming "the past decade of austerity to be over." AUSTERITY?!!! This who they insist on working with? #OmnibusGOPbetrayal
