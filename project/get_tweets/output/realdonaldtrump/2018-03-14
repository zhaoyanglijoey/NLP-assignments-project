@hardball : The reason that @realDonaldTrump poll keep hovering low 30s to low 40s is you have @FoxNews & the other "conservatives media" which r consume by low info individuals which r feeding them propaganda 24/7. If they were getting proper news, he would be in low 20s/tens

It's past time for Sessions to go and get an AG not recused from the Russian collusion investigation. Stop looking at @realDonaldTrump and follow the evidence which leads to BHO, HRC and the DNC. Then move on to Uranium 1, IRS targeting and fast n' furious. This is unreal.

Since @realDonaldTrump isn't a real professional but plays one on TV I will give him some free advice. When you decide to let someone go you put aside time to sit with them and provide them the professional courtesy of looking them in the eyes and letting them know and why.
What a coward...he can't even say the words himself. @realDonaldTrump is no leader. Weak.
