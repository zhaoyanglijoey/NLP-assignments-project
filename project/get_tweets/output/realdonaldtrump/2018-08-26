@realDonaldTrump is a giant douche bag.
@realDonaldTrump any comments on Jacksonville, Mr Soon to be ex-45?
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump will officially order flags to half mast for @SenJohnMcCain (like he did for Billy Graham) ... I won't hold my breath.
I made a tweet back when #Mueller arrested the first person tied to @realDonaldTrump and basically said all he was going to do was flip guys till he made it to the very top. Aka Police Work 101 and it got deleted. #heavy people till you get what you want #MuellerInvestigation
Attn @realDonaldTrump
What else would you expect from the little, petty, tantrum throwing baby who is the @realDonaldTrump ?
More Gun Violence in USA, @realDonaldTrump is not a real president becuase he has no balls, no will, to ban all guns and all types of guns in every single suburb, state, and entire country of USA. #Jacksonville
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Fox News has turned into a liberal news station. Im sick of seeing liberals running their mouths.I think our POTUS should start giving his interviews to One American News.Time for me to say goodbye to Fox.I will watch Laura, Sean, Tucker, Levin only
@realDonaldTrump you total wanker you can't even release a competent statement marking the death of McCain...just do the whole world a favour and resign you utter shitheap
@realDonaldTrump another mass shooting wish the POTUS had balls but he'd rather suck the utter of his Cash cow

Actually, I think @realDonaldTrump handled Mr.McCain with class, he had a lot he could have told the public about Mr. McCain past, but he didn't!
@realDonaldTrump Just saw a pic of McCain and other men Standing in front of a Sign "No Nukes for America" So maybe this is what he voted against with other Republicans?
#JohnMcCain is the only republican I have ever voted for. A true hero. Thanks for your service and for standing up against our current monster of a president @realDonaldTrump
Is @realDonaldTrump at all concerned about his offspring..

And the shooter was a white American....what do you think about that @realDonaldTrump ?? Moron in chief!!
David @shestokas went to President Trump's Rally in Elkhart, IN. His story from that event is about Elkhart Police Sgt. D. L. Jones. http:// dld.bz/gNYWX #MAGA #KAG #LNYHBT #TCOT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @tmmillican @PhilpottDon @pastorkenrp @Ginlefebvre @OTgame7
@realDonaldTrump SIGNED and Publicly Declared the "PRESIDENTIAL ORDER OF ENFORCEMENT", get? Operation "008"..Zero Depravity, Zero Malfunction [Debt Production], Forever? Just pretended-authority "shouldn't be there" til then...top to bottom..guaranteed..
Whoever it is keep leaking! @realDonaldTrump is the most putrid person of our times.
@realDonaldTrump is going to be tweeting up a storm on that day. Watch out.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @foxnewsalert #MAGA #KAGA Breaking: Pope Francis my be resigning due to moving child pedophile priest around the US and covered up molestation charges!
@realDonaldTrump Watch some news today. This is how we honor an actual American hero (McCain). But someday at Private Bonespur's funeral, people will be pissing on that grave for decades.
after a week in which @realDonaldTrump saw his lawyer plead guilty, implicating him felonies, his campaign manager found guilty of felonies, his CFO and his BFF at AMI testifying with immunity, a bellman alleging he fathered a child, his approval rating jumped w/GOP jumped to 90%
the @realDonaldTrump side only appears to be working for the Russians and the top 1%. Do the math, you are worse off than you think. pic.twitter.com/0sdeWFg56m
@BarackObama is nothing but coward that has done nothing but try to tear this country apart. He started in Chicago and look at it today. He FAILED and he knows it lol!!! Taking this country back one election at a time @realDonaldTrump keep winning Sir! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump very disappointed that the White House did not do more regarding the passing of an American hero even if I fo not agree with a lost of his philosophies
@realDonaldTrump You are such a jerk and making us the laughing stock of the world, take your law breaking in-laws and deport the lot of you.
@TheJuanWilliams Your Bad behavior is more problematic, than President Trump's; that panel was the worst panel on @FoxNewsSunday ! None of you have a clue what President @realDonaldTrump means, when he says things. SAD
Wtf man how can I go help her??? @realDonaldTrump
#DeclassifyitAll @realDonaldTrump Sir, please. We deserve to see the truth and judge for ourselves. #GreatAwakening #QAnon #Spygate #MAGA
Equally fair is blaming @realDonaldTrump for creating the atmosphere that allowed US citizen and White supremacist Dylann Storm Roof to murder nine people, not one, in Charleston. @POTUS is disgusting.
#AnotherFLShooting and yet we can be assured that the #Republican Congress @GOP and Administration @realDonaldTrump will do nothing yet again because their actions have been bought by @NRA . All we can do is #VoteThemAllOut #VOTE2018 #VoteSaveAmerica #WhenWeAllVote #VoteBlue
It'd be nice if we could put a Million of us in DC some weekend soon and say in one voice.. Back off Dems! We support American, so therefore we support @realDonaldTrump as out @POTUS
@SteveSchmidtSES said something today that's really worth thinking about. He said, "nobody wants their child to grow up and be @realDonaldTrump , but lots would be proud if they were like John McCain. Impossible to argue that point.
@realDonaldTrump When Trump Dies His remains will be put in a Port-A-Potty in front of Trump Tower to be used as a public urinal After all he is America's PP-President
Sociopaths do not feel empathy or sympathy. @realDonaldTrump and his spawn were born without the ability to feel empathy, sympathy or compassion.
I have some thoughts and prayers today as a Canadian. How about the law makers grow some fucking balls and stop what you allow every week. @realDonaldTrump ... you should all be ashamed of the stays quo. THIS is the damage of your laws. How fucking dare you do nothing.
@realDonaldTrump this has never happened to any other U.S. president. This is what you call #MAGA ? pic.twitter.com/FtreFGS5hm
@realDonaldTrump No one wants a low-life at a funeral!
#Fns can someone please tell Juan that Hillary was not investigated since we are just learning wtf was going on @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump Please help us protect our Southern/Confederate Heritage from hooligans. Thanks. Mary Stevens

And how many @realDonaldTrump and Trump Organization tax returns have they been able to look at so far? I sense a lot of fear from Donald and his cronies in the Trump family.
Obama reversed the process of our government. The DOJ has become confused & now believe they are in place to approve or deny actions of @POTUS Did @jeffsessions forget he is a POLITICAL appointee? His job is to implement EXACTLY what his boss @realDonaldTrump says or RESIGN!
Trump Is Super Sad That No One Cared About His Rally This Week @realDonaldTrump https:// youtu.be/WHXahH42xjk via @YouTube
Great group today to protest @realDonaldTrump golfing again! #traitor #fakepresident #LongMaySheWave pic.twitter.com/iKNTVaAHwG
@realDonaldTrump Anything on Jacksonville?
Where was the outrage when Mollie Tibbetts was killed by an illegal alien? Where were all of the Hollywood brainwashed libs? MSM put her story on the bottom of the pile. Zero outrage from the left because their policies were responsible. @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WyazzKjjhY
Tell @realDonaldTrump to stop complaining about sports then....
@realDonaldTrump creating jobs for Holmes and shelter with sleeping quarters and food medical. CONVERSATION CORP . CHECK FDR .PUT PEOPLE WORK. WITH PAY SELF WORTH.
If it wasn't for @SenJohnMcCain 's sacrifices the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump Fake 45 would not have the opportunity to be such a corrupt party.
@realDonaldTrump is a small, insecure, petty man.
@realDonaldTrump @GOP
Further evidence @realDonaldTrump is a petty little man.

McCain hated @realDonaldTrump more than he loved his fellow Arizonians.
Correct . But @realDonaldTrump did set a Record today . This is the 234th Mass Shooting this year , An All -Time Record . Congrats @POTUS !
@realDonaldTrump is low rent. He wouldn't make a pimple on @SenJohnMcCain 's or @BarackObama 's ass . #IllegitimatePresident #PutinsPuppet #LockHimUp

What kind word did McCain ever say about him? What how do you people rationalize someone hating someone and trying to set @realDonaldTrump up, saying terrible things, and he dies, Trump should worship? Or be fake?
LOL gotta love @realDonaldTrump
@RepBrianMast supports @realDonaldTrump who has denigrated @SenJohnMcCain . A fraud. VOTE HIM OUT, Please,
@realDonaldTrump is a real class act!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump
Time Congress, particularly @GOP who are trying to take credit for @realDonaldTrump 's hard work, to actually do something for Americans instead of themselves. Our Founding Fathers believe free speech so important, it was the FIRST Amendment. Is that meaning over your heads?
@FBI TRYING TO TRY THE QUEEN IN THE QUEEN COURT!!! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you are such a child
Yes, he is correct to not lie to appease the #FakeNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump so glad you are not saying anything, don't fake what is real, I too am not speaking, or lying,
So what??? Enjoy Mr. President. @realDonaldTrump
