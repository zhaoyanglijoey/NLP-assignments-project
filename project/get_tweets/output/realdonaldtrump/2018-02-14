@realDonaldTrump @SenatorDurbin Hope you both would be ok with words of condolences when one of yours would be killed and those in charge say now is not the time to discuss. See my next tweet for a proposal or give me yours.:
Glad @realDonaldTrump is hard at work while our country is mourning. He is useless
VOTE OUT ANY MEMBER FROM CONGRESS IN THE @GOP OR @DNC WHO IS SUPPORTED BY @NRA THIS NOVEMBER!! #EnoughIsEnough @HouseGOP @SenateGOP DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS #schoolshooting !! #NRA #Trump #GUNCONTROL NOW!! @realDonaldTrump #ValentinesDayMassacre
So he was triggered by the black hats to create this mess. Bad ppl in Trump admin must go to jail now. Tired of waiting while corrupt CIA screws this country. ENOUGH! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Clearly @god is not listening to your "thoughts and prayers" ... so how about some action to keep students safe? Or do you prefer to answer for your lack of action in the next world? #GunControlNow

@realDonaldTrump and #Republicans in Congress are complicit in the now routine mass shootings in the US. They have been paid to allow it to happen. pic.twitter.com/4gdBzOr0Yz
We've been hit by 18 school shootings so far in 2018. EIGHTEEN! This is ridiculous! Somehow, @realDonaldTrump and the US Government and us the people will have to find a way to limit these shootings! #ParklandSchoolShooting
Brian, I just read the story online. And I agree with U 100%! Maybe if @realDonaldTrump wud do a #GunControl bill, this STOPS!

Every morning, teachers and children wonder if today will be the day they will die. This is not ok. @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SpeakerRyan
@realDonaldTrump has tech to input thoughts, words, directly into mind. Google, scientists showing possible with rudimentary items. U should
@realDonaldTrump You have the nerve to refer to other countries as shitholes. At least shit can be washed off. Can't say that for #bulletholes like at #Parkland and the many other #schoolshootings can you? #BrowardCounty #FloridaSchoolShooting
The @NRA is a terrorist organization. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan you allowed this to happen. #stonemandouglasshooting
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @NRA @FoxNews How many lives have to be lost before you admit too many guns is the problem in this country? Do you find it amusing? Can you imagine these victims being your kids? Shame on you!
I guess we need to wait and see how the shooter got the gun and all the clips and ammunition, but we don't have to wait for stricter gun laws! Screw @realDonaldTrump and his fuck buddy @waynelapierrejr
@realDonaldTrump The worst fuckin president ever! Just openly & blatantly racist, prejudice& naive
Mr @realDonaldTrump Will you continue to allow the sale of weapons in your country?
Fuck @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump hi mr president i am proud of the job you are doing to revive the economic system

Hey @realDonaldTrump , how exactly are you making America safe again?
So @NRA @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Is it still too early to talk about THE GODDAMN GUN PROBLEM yet? #americanpussies #gungasmassholes
time to take down the treasonous 9th circut court. all within @realDonaldTrump power.
Seems like $130k in hush money is overkill. @realDonaldTrump admits that women are nothing more than genital grabbing playthings and his adoring base didn't seem to give a damn about that! Curious to see what she was being hushed about. Can't just be about a roll in the hay!
Florida Well....at least @realDonaldTrump has gone on record against school shootings and that no child should be afraid at school. Still no word from him opposing domestic violence or suggesting that no woman should be afraid in her own home.
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/KFDQSQvvJn
Still think your gun laws are up to the job? How many more times is this going to happen. Very very sad. @realDonaldTrump
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenateGOP CAN WE TALK ABOUT #GunControlNow NOW? #MAGA #FloridaShooting pic.twitter.com/2i5Hb0kwmk
18 school shootings in 2018. That's 18 too many. Fix it @realDonaldTrump I'm tired of your words and tweets!
@realDonaldTrump @PRyan is now still not the time to talk about gun control you fucking idiots :((
Every parent in America, except @realDonaldTrump , just hugged their kids. Trump went golfing.
It's just not a good PHOTO OP day for @realDonaldTrump Blood on his hands looks bad on camera
@realDonaldTrump TE INFORMO MADURO IS A PEOPLE, DO NOT FOLLOW US SILVER TO TREAT JENERAL A WAR IN VENEZUELA THESE RODIADO OF RATS AND ARE ENRIQUECIENDO WITH YOU, HELP DETROY CALIFORNIA COLORADO FLORIDA PUERTO RICO THEY NEED YOU COPETON
@realDonaldTrump ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING UNDER YOUR WATCH AND U AND THE REPS. ARE DOING NOTHING ABOUT THEM BUT SIT ON YOUR THUMBS!
@SenShelby @SenDougJones As English is a requirement for Citizenship we need to pass H.R. 997 and keep election ballots in English only! @USRepGaryPalmer @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You are NOT hiring the best people and keep in mind that U.S. citizens are your boss! @IvankaTrump and her husband, @PressSec and for real Gen Kelly have to go! You and your crew are on thin ice!
@realDonaldTrump After the Las Vegas mass shooting, you did nothing (besides LIE to get your #TAXSCAM passed). After numerous school shootings in 2018, you DID NOTHING! The deaths today are due PRIMARILY TO YOUR #NEGLIGENCE !!!! #RESIGN45andVP #NRAsponsoredTERRORISM
45 days into 2018 and already 7 school shootings. 20 killed, dozens injured. This cannot be tolerated anymore. When will our government pick the safety of our children over money from the NRA? @realDonaldTrump enough with your prayers. The time for gun control is now.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @NRA @GOP , let me guess, today isn't the day to talk about gun control. You are all complicit cowards. #DouglasHighSchool
@realDonaldTrump why was the shooter taken to the hospital? Did he shoot hisself or something?
@realDonaldTrump I hate you with every ounce of me
Listen up @realDonaldTrump and @gop if you think We the People are going to let the 33% that favor you control us YOU ARE WRONG!!!! pic.twitter.com/bxVVI4AiVA
There have been 83 mass shootings under the Presidency of @realDonaldTrump and yet, every time it's just "thoughts and prayers". THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS WON'T BRING THOSE KIDS BACK YOU MORON. Nor will they stop people doing the same in future. #Parkland
@GOP @NRA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 17 dead kids! You all must be so proud!!!! You are all complicit.
Wake Up @realDonaldTrump we need #GunControlNow
Summary from @realDonaldTrump - see , stock market is up pic.twitter.com/wXuCzWoTzV
@realDonaldTrump this is the 29th mass shooting of 2018 & it's only 45 days into year. 17 dead. NO MORE! Not 1 more death frm guns! When will you publicly say anything about guns? Still too early? Vegas shooting was months ago, yet so quiet about this issue which is non partisan.
One thing we all know is true: @realDonaldTrump is owned by @NRA to the tune of 35 million $$ and Russia for some unknown amount. HE WILL DO NOTHING!
@realDonaldTrump ... Liar-in-Chief. Complicit. Fact.
@realDonaldTrump how many children are going to have to die due to school shootings before you actually do something?? Asking for a friend
@realDonaldTrump Not much point in being sorry for the shooting, Orange Boy. Innocent American kids have to bear the consequences of being gun mad and this idiot having access to them.
@realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott @joenegronfl
@realDonaldTrump 17 DEAD! #StonemamDouglasHigh #BrowardCountyFL #schoolshooting #dosomething #guncontrol
@realDonaldTrump wants to blame all deaths by illegal immigrants on Dems. Does that mean we should blame all gun deaths on @GOP and @NRA
@realDonaldTrump Thank You Mr President, we all feel the same. Does this mean we can finally expect Gun Control??? I know Guns Don't Shoot People, but I also know, Guns dont shoot themselves.
@realDonaldTrump Guns in hands of mentally sick & ill intended people needs to end! Human life is much bigger & important than NRA!

Isnt gun control the best maverick issue where @realDonaldTrump could actually make America great again and drain a swamp?

@realDonaldTrump correction; Nancy Pelosi, what a disgrace while people are grieving. My prayers and condolences go out to the families, students, parents, teachers, staff, and the state of Florida.
Remember that @realDonaldTrump has filed for bankruptcy as often has he filed for military deferments. He's a con man and a coward. He has no idea how to effectively run a business. Why would he expect him to understand running a country or balancing its budget?
Happy Valentine's Day @realDonaldTrump . Care for a late night swim?
@realDonaldTrump Remember the feeling you felt just a couple of days ago when your daughter-in-law was assaulted with corn starch? Imagine how the moms and dads of those 17 dead kids in Florida are feeling tonight. You can do something but I'll bet that again you will do nothing.
This is the environment Obama and his democratic acolytes have fostered! Our Manchurian candidate has done more damage to normal society in 8 short years than ever expected! #RulesForRadicals @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @PRyan @TheJusticeDept @FBI
Meanwhile the entire world is unsafe because of @realDonaldTrump
Shady Shulkin on CBS News trying to lie his way out his European trip. BUSTED! by the IG. Roman bath's, altering emails? Hell, he wouldn't answer my 3 emails about Charlotte VA corruption in mental health. FIRE SHADY SHULKIN! @RepMikeCoffman , @realDonaldTrump , @SenThomTillis
Good luck with the rural supporters, @realDonaldTrump
Your words and tweets are meaningless @realDonaldTrump Take action!
AMERICA WE NEED YOU TO VOTE AND RETWEET SO WE CAN SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO @realDonaldTrump WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
@realDonaldTrump is he a illegal immigrant who shot 17 innocent people? Why you allow weapon to the civilian? Who is to be blamed for such acts?
@WhiteHouse @NRA @VP @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @BillOReilly @SpeakerRyan @AnnCoulter @Cabinet @HouseGOP @LPNational , you are aware that thoughts and prayers have no impact whatsoever on people who are killed, injured or victimized by gun violence, right? How dare you
Hillary would not have even thought of being with a PORN STAR....that's ONE of TRUMPS SEXUAL FORTE! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
How many more children need to die at school before you fix the problem? #EndGunViolence @realDonaldTrump
Time for our Congress to ACT. No more posturing on this. The hell with the NRA. This is very personal, not Political. However, we expect our Government to protect it's Citizens and yet, NOTHING. @realDonaldTrump wants a wall to protect what???
@realdonaldtrump At your inauguration, you said "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now." 17(so far) people died today. What are you doing to stop "this American carnage"? How would you feel if your son or grandchild was a student at that school?
@realDonaldTrump and his republican minions want to replace food stamps with Blue Apron like boxes of food. Maybe they could use Soylent Green instead. Ship a few chips of Soylent Green at a low postage rate and problem solved.
@realDonaldTrump I implore you to talk with congress and get them to introduce a new bill that allows families to involuntarily institutionalize family who are mentally ill . We need those people off our streets and out of our schools !
Watching the clock and waiting for . @realdonaldtrump and . @FoxNews to blame the heritage of the shooter in #ParklandShooting . Countdown to either of them to mention #Latino . #Florida #schoolshooting
Where's the next school shooting gonna happen in America tomorrow? Fuck you @realDonaldTrump Fuck you @NRA #Terrorist #Florida
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The Florida school shooting ought to mean enough is enough. I'm an advocate of having guns available for hunting and self protection. But nobody needs an Automatic rifle for either of these. A handgun for protection and a shotgun for hunting is enough.
RT ... if you are as tired of school shootings as I am! @realDonaldTrump #NotOneMore #WHY
When's a good time to talk about #guncontrol @realDonaldTrump ? Let us know.
@realDonaldTrump NO PARADE ...the coast guard needs 15million to fix its only heavy ice breaker and a down payment for a new one that costs 750million .... its all in the priorities .... NO 30 million dollar PARADE for #Trump adulation
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Let's stop the bull shit and call it like it is. The NRA lines your pockets so you support them at all costs. You're against @Kaepernick7 kneeling but you'll kneel for @waynelapierrejr & NRA ... GOP = #GunsOverPeople
@TGowdySC is a F*cking Joke. Everyone knows when you retire or resign from Congress, all power and influence disappears. This investigation into #RobPorter is just a chivalrous act for @realDonaldTrump to change the news cycle. #FACTS
Sorry to hear your news http:// America.RIP to those victims. Please though.. let this be the case that prioritises sorting your gun laws out. Why on earth do you want them? #FloridaSchoolShooting @realDonaldTrump make this your first sensible decision
@realDonaldTrump HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE TO GUN VIOLENCE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING? WHERE IS YOUR LIMIT? THESE ARE INNOCENT YOUNG PEOPLE LOSING THEIR LIVES. I SUPPOSE YOULL CONTINUE TO HOPE AND PRAY.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Child murderers, all of you. Your despicable allegiance to @NRA while children continue to die without the necessary political remedy of gun control is inhumane. You are complicit in every mass shooting.
You jokers always want facts, where are ANY to support that?? @AJW1020 @BAudible @SamW55 @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump hi yeah we clearly need gun control so if you could get the fuck on it that would be great:)
@realDonaldTrump Again, the shooter was stopped by people with firearms. Schools need armed security and volunteer staff members with CCW.
@realDonaldTrump should have to pay @StormyDaniels double the fee for admitting she saw his little Cheeto Bandito.
@realDonaldTrump I SEE SOMETHING: COMPLICIT GOP & NRA - GOP: SAY SOMETHING!! What's wrong with you people??? pic.twitter.com/ujBjOknuqq
It seem like the whole world been getting worse since @realDonaldTrump bitch ass been elected
@realDonaldTrump
And @realDonaldTrump won't lift a finger to pull the teeth of the NRA or tighten our pitifully weak gun laws. Every day I am terrified to drop my kids off at school.
Let's be clear. @SpeakerRyan is a serial murderer. @SenateMajLdr is a serial murderer. @mike_pence is a serial murderer. @realDonaldTrump is a serial murderer. The whole @GOP is predicated on serial murder.
@realDonaldTrump . 30 Billion for your Wall and not one cent for research on #GunSense .You've done nothing to make us Safe. Nothing! @NRA
I, Donald J. Trump, am calling for a total and complete shut down on gun sales in the United States ... "Until we can figure out WHAT THE HELL is going on." Yeah. Sure. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/LvLSlkrNJw
@realDonaldTrump , now tell us all, exactly HOW are kids, teachers, parents supposed to feel safe in schools?
Well, to be accurate, @realDonaldTrump and his ilk don't "buy" or "pay for" anything, in any sense of those words. None of their kids or grandkids are ever among the dead. The NRA buys Trump et al and the kids, parents, teachers pay.
#GunControlNow #GunControlNow #GunControlNow #GunControlNow #GunControlNow #GunControlNow @realDonaldTrump THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE NOT WORKING! WE NEED #GunControlNow @uscongress00 17 CHILDREN DEAD- SEVERAL MORE INJURED. DO SOMETHING NOW!!!
Do something about IR @realDonaldTrump ! You have the power... you are the president. Not just a man in power to pad your ego and profit from promoting your scam businesses. DO SOMETHING TO STOP SENSELESS GUN MURDERS. PLEASE.
Well @realDonaldTrump , @SpeakerRyan ... are you on your knees praying? Or are you calling up Wayne and asking for more money? #guncontrol
@realDonaldTrump will find a solution. The man always does. #StableGenius
spineless. heartless. soulless. ALL of them. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec ...for starters.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump We need your help. We The People, demand you order the FBI to do their job, and conduct a proper investigation into the Corruption Michael Gill and State of Corruption have been fighting for 10 years now. #InvestigateTheFBI #StateofCorruption

@realDonaldTrump FUCKING FIX GUN CONTROL YOU DIPSHIT
I'm ready to see y'alls bitch-assed president get on here and talk that shit about the Parkland shooter like he does when the perpetrator is of color. Anything to say, @realDonaldTrump ?
Will pay .25$ more on every gallon of gas as soon as two things happen 1: @realDonaldTrump shows us all his tax returns for the last say 10 years 2:The over trillion dollars in corporate welfare that just went out the treasury comes back in to help pay the 1%ers share of the plan
Since @realDonaldTrump will never do it, happy #valantinesday . I assume even though you sold your soul for money you still have a heart. Assume that is. #sad #ChainMigration #getonboard pic.twitter.com/v50EOrzPMU
hey @realDonaldTrump and the entire @GOP : to hell with your prayers and condolences and start protecting the children. stop bending over for the @NRA , you morally corrupt assholes.
@realDonaldTrump @jameswoods Well said and should be followed by federal and state not rhetoric but pass laws and create crime analytics for such people
@realDonaldTrump demand everyone hand in their firearms ar a local police office ! #GunControlNow #guncontrol
@realDonaldTrump why would you resolve gun problems with more guns. If you see what happened at the school in Florida you should know not to solve this with guns but with gun control! All my prayers go out to everyone affected by this #stonemanshooting #Florida
Another sad day in America. I can't see it becoming great again whilst kids can kill kids & kids get massacred in school. My heart goes out to all those affected by this horrible tragedy. No doubt; 1) @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will claim "fake news" 2) @NRA will want more guns
Wow. So inexpensive? Thought acting like a third world dictatorship would cost more. And only puts a relatively little more in debt. Wow. @GOP @realDonaldTrump
The US Military spends over $1B in advertising each year. Spending $10-30M for a National Parade would bring a far greater ROI for recruitment and national pride. @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs
Dear @realDonaldTrump It's 8 months & 3 weeks until the #BlueWave . Enjoy your hateful agenda Relish the pain & misery your sadistic ego likes to inflict on the poor & the weak Because what you have to look forward to is your impeachment & imprisonment when the Dems take control.
