Coming to you live from the #ASEAN Finance Ministers meeting here in #Singapore soon on @BloombergTV as @realDonaldTrump steps up the fight in the tit for tat trade spat #trade #china pic.twitter.com/R5cQL8Yb70
@realDonaldTrump has managed to make the Chinese the good guys on the subject of trade
@realDonaldTrump has no idea for our country. As proven in the past and present he's only on it for his "brand". Albeit his $ h !t+y brand.
So how can @realDonaldTrump sue @StormyDaniels for releasing information on a contract he didn't sign for an affair he didn't have for the payment he never made?
I've heard from a few people that they wish @realDonaldTrump dead. I think it would be a bad idea to make him a martyr. A life spent in suffering & loneliness in a prison is far more justified than him feeling nothing at all. #DumpTrump
@QveenJoan @realDonaldTrump What the hell do you think? I disapprove!

Trade wars topped out in the years between WW1 & WW2.

Does @realDonaldTrump know how anything works in the government?
Another blow to small business from the fake potus Dolt45/ @realDonaldTrump 100 billion more in tariffs which will be countered by China to the tune of 100 billion. Nobody loses but small business in this so called trade war. Getting harder to believe he's for the little guy.
. @realDonaldTrump God damn, liar. "Not a conspiracy theory, folks," President Donald Trump said in West Virginia on Thursday. "Millions and millions of people."
@realDonaldTrump I'm 68 and have never voted Democratic in my life. Much more of this trade war and I'll help give you a Democratic Congress to deal with after the mid-terms.
