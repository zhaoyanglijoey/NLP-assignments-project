@realDonaldTrump Screw 'em all, Mr. President! Do your thing! They mess with you, we mess with them! Jail the traitors!!!!!
I think $50 million is too much for @realDonaldTrump 's #MilitaryParade but I do like the idea of having a parade like that. I just think we could use $50 million for a lot better things.

@FoxNews @kilmeade @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Any chance those "good" friends at FBI sat on this information on Porter on purpose like they have sabotaged other endeavors?
So @realDonaldTrump 's plan for #DreamActNow is forced conscription, do I have that right? http:// politi.co/2EPlhq6 Because that worked great for the roman empire. Almost as good as military parades. When do these folks quit and start the first order?
Remember @ChrisMurphyCT you are a politician and @realDonaldTrump is the successful businessman, so sit down and shut up!
@realDonaldTrump / you should have a press conference explaining the visa lottery, chain migration, the end of the DACA program & why they are so problematic for the nation's welfare, and why a wall is so important to the nation's overall economy & sovereignty.
So where or what were you doing whole year why do nothing then try to shut down. Shows real actions of senate. Do nothing. @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @VP a very sad example of democracy. More banana republic.
. @realDonaldTrump Hey asshole! My 401k lost 19+%. My husband lost 12+%. Not a single word from you. You own this. This is your fault. I hope you lose everything you have. Fuck you.
Four indictments. How many indictments does Hillary have? Obama? Why hasn't @realDonaldTrump enacted the #RussianSanctions ? Why hasn't he addressed the cyber security threat Russia represents? Why is he obstructing the #MuellerInvestigation ? Innocent people don't act like this.
@realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch @SpeakerRyan @VP please read my message above, I need an answer. I graduated already, I need to get involved/be heard in every single issue/harmed happened to me by Hispanic, I ask why the court destroyed me?Where are my rights
In light of fake news often, @GenJohnKelly should be forgiven for his support of Porter at first! Mistakes happen and again, in light of lies and FAKE News John Kelly should be given a pass!! @realDonaldTrump
He is completely delusional if @realDonaldTrump thinks this will make the American people happy or overlook his inability to govern. #ImpeachTrump
I blame @realDonaldTrump for this because he appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions who has encouraged cops to be or remain criminals by refusing to enforce #ConsentDecrees against police depts in which civil rights violations have been rampant. #Baltimore

@realDonaldTrump ,7 days ago you were bragging and taking credit for what Obama did with economy his second term,now a downturn and your saggy ass jowls have become sentinent and silent. Douchebag !( not rooting against economy,just you,did I say Douchebag,yup.)

So this is her 4th time fired from a reality show, brought to us by @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump You once said that you hire the best people. Really? Steve Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, racists. Omarosa, bitch. Porter, abuser. That's just for starters.
@realDonaldTrump once again a stupid comment from our Republican President, feeling the need to implement religion into politics (separation of church and state)
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for the extra money in my check!!!

Please note that @realDonaldTrump hasn't shut up about how the stock market keeps going up & patting himself on the back, over the past year. However, this week alone, the market has lost ALL of that gain. And only one tweet-- which he deflects blame.
I agree. Love that @realDonaldTrump is our president but please sir get our spending under control.
@realDonaldTrump YOUR FBI & DOJ Leaders are CORRUPT! FIRE SESSIONS, WRAY, STRZOK, MCCABE, ROSENSTEIN & ALL OTHER CRIMINALS! APPOINT ONE OF YOUR TRUSTED US ATTORNEYS AS ACTING AG. APPOINT NEW SPECIAL PROSECUTORS FOR ALL OBAMA ADMIN & DEEP STATE CRIMES! https:// youtu.be/PUTQQSxLpEU
