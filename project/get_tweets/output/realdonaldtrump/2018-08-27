Keep tarrying in the place of Prayer! pic.twitter.com/djvuFotP3k
We also noticed that @realDonaldTrump didn't answer reporters' questions about McCain.
Ask to @realDonaldTrump
So someone convinced @realDonaldTrump that his behavior would hurt the 2018 election for Republicans? There's no other reason that this stubborn SOB would do the right thing by a WAR HERO! #MAGA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/KXsljxnASy
@realDonaldTrump Trump's incompetence on full display as he invited the press to cover his call to Mexico's president
People in America simply do not know proper airport ettiequte. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
Yep, that's the idea . @HillaryClinton And if the POTUS were a Democrat, the court would potentially shift Left for decades. It's how our Republic works and it's . @realDonaldTrump 's turn to govern. #ShipofFools
@realDonaldTrump Hi President Trump, I hope are doing okay. I hate that Senator McCain has passed. So much respect for him. Could you look at my FB page (Margie Lee Green). How many have I left out? How much more could I do if I could? A question I saw online.
Pleased? How was this ever a question? Also, was @realDonaldTrump nickname for you Sleepy? I forget.
Bueno y con el ciego hp de @JSantrich_FARC que va a pasar? que lo extraditen ya mismo ese criminal. @USEmbassyBogota @IvanDuque @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @FiscaliaCol

That would imply that there is no room to negotiate with @realDonaldTrump .It's always take or leave it.
Did he get you the Birth Certificate that you and @realDonaldTrump have been trying to find for years??
Love My President! God Thank You For Spending Us @realDonaldTrump
Just say he shines as a beacon against @realDonaldTrump , which he was, without even speaking his name.
@Twitter saying this tweet has been deleted but here it is on your homepage! Sorry about your ordeal...Justice is coming with @realDonaldTrump
Yet no one cares about this list when you mention @realDonaldTrump . The hypocrisy.
@realDonaldTrump really G is that true? Or fake news so you say lmao
That's ok, I'm sure @realDonaldTrump has never seen either of them coming either.
@realDonaldTrump This is a serious stretch but I am going for it. Please check out my page. I am truly reaching for help right now.
Can we agree that @realDonaldTrump has ties to America's mafia? Can we also agree that Trump has ties 2 the Russian mafia? Can we agree that the American mafia & the Russian mafia have been laundering billions of dollars through Trump's real estate business? #CultureOfCorruption
It says so much that John McCain asked the two men who defeated him in his presidential runs to give eulogies, while @realDonaldTrump had to be literally forced to make a small statement, like a petulant spoiled child being made to say thank you.
@realDonaldTrump has no soul! #ObliterateTheGOP in November!

Went back on @realDonaldTrump time line, starting around Aug 15, all his tweets that I liked don't show it anymore! Went through & liked AGAIN! @Jack
@realDonaldTrump How do you decided on anything? You make a decision and then soon after change it after criticism. A president should deeply think before every decision but it seems you make decisions on a whim with no thought at all.
Evil & foolish is a bad look @realDonaldTrump #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
@realDonaldTrump Shut up pic.twitter.com/hI4bvX8AE8

@realDonaldTrump is by far the worst person on Earth. Actually, he's not even a person. He's a circus peanut that's been chewed up and spit out by a toddler that's never had one before and is crying because it was the worst thing he's ever tried.

True! And remember when @BarackObama said, 'those jobs are NOT coming back.' Remember when Obama did the Mike Drop and said @realDonaldTrump will NEVER be @POTUS
@cindymccain Please for God's Sake don't make a farce of the US Senate. America need the MOST QUALIFIED PERSON in the Senate and Lady THAT AIN'T YOU! @RealJamesWoods @greggutfeld @VP @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump WTF? You are not about kneeling during the anthem for change but you are ok with not lowering that same Flag for the death of a sitting US Senator. Words can't express the shamefullness of your actions. I am a veteran and a conservative. You are neither.
So, Poe Dameron was crank calling him? @GOP @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you show your true colors always, never changes, always a Disgrace
Deflated democrats stilltrying to take focus from keeping America Great with stupid Russian investigation and ridiculous Mueller team milking the Americans for millions of $$. @realDonaldTrump
@JustinTrudeau can you please ask @realDonaldTrump to free @JulianAssange A great injustice is being done to a man who has served humanity greatly. If we can point out human rights violations in KSA, why don't we do it when it's US? This man deserves medals, not confinement.
Agreed tRump @realDonaldTrump is a insecure big baby and a disgrace to the world to be so spiteful and will be remembered as just that. As the world weeps for the loss of a honest true patriot senator John McCain.
@realDonaldTrump What I believe is that whatever you put out to the universe comes back to you just like the ripples in a pond when you throw a stone, they come back to shore at your feet. You are a cowardly, spoiled, petulant fuck of flesh..but you know this.2/2 pic.twitter.com/madYXMbcQS
@realDonaldTrump P.O.S.
@realDonaldTrump When I fall asleep thinking of something I might not have said: Is possible to for Students who DON'T speak ENGLISH, go 1st N2 an Alien/immigration center to learn English/USA History B4 entering W/Citizens. This will keep Aliens from Lowering USA Students!
@realDonaldTrump is a disgusting pig
Brit. . . please get off it. If the truth is allowed to come out on McCain, you would be appalled and feel like a big fool. Do some research. He was an evil man involved in the AZ drug/sex/human/CHILD trafficking syndicate. Wake up!!!!!!!! @realdonaldtrump is being kind.

@realDonaldTrump you handled the John McCain flag issue just fine. He was a good war hero and OK Senator

MUCH MORE likely @realDonaldTrump is driving Libs & Dems toward even further LW insanity. Consider how many liberals have moved LEFT toward progressive & now FURTHER left toward Socialism. Midterms 2B a litmus 2indicate whether they need 2move back toward the middle for 2020.
@lisamurkowski I hope you aren't foolish enough to vote for Kavanaugh. The ONLY reason @realDonaldTrump wants him on SCOTUS is to save his own ass.
When twice barred from the funeral of an American political icon it's time for Trump to look in the mirror. @realDonaldTrump is the most petty, vindictive, small minded person ever to hold the office of POTUS
@realDonaldTrump would have been a 5 star general if not for them painful bone spurs. Arggghhhhg
Even in death, @SenJohnMcCain is a better man than @realDonaldTrump could ever dream of being.
@luv69 @CHUCKWOOLERY @markyoungtruth @realDonaldTrump The children without vaccinations in TX, are they neglected baby ring 's born into DCF, CPS custody!? What happened to the laws I was reared, no vaccinations, no school!?
Don't tell @funder but I heard from some people that conspiring to commit treason by advertising that you "helped" with a phony Trump/Russia story was punishable by death but please don't tell his asshat friends that #MAGA @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr

@TigerWoods comments about @realDonaldTrump and the office of the President of the United States is how EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN SHOULD FEEL!! I have the utmost respect for Tiger Woods.
@realDonaldTrump the best deal maker? NO -A senior administration official acknowledged that the changes could make certain products, such as automobiles, more expensive for American buyers because the costs that go into production were expected to increase.
Cut back or raise prices on electricity & water sent to the USA. IMMEDIATELY tax or stop shipping US dirty coal through BC ports. Its so dirty it cant be shipped from USA ports. It would kill mining & a pile of @realDonaldTrump supporter jobs. Of course we wont really do anything

@realDonaldTrump you're such a piece of stool. People ask you about Sen. McCain's passing and you are so cowardly that you dont even respond. Shame on you.

Oh, so @realDonaldTrump is in cleanup mode after his disgraceful, disgusting actions toward the honorable, admired @SenJohnMcCain . His actions only shows what a weak vindictive man he is. Trump will never measure up!
@realDonaldTrump A silver star; 3 bronze stars; purple hearts, many more medals, McCain was a true hero. You, your daddy paid doctors to say you had "bone spurs". A true hero vs you!
@realDonaldTrump you make my dogs crap smell good, you are a worthless excuse for a president, and you hold no compassion to a true American Hero, John McCain.
@realDonaldTrump Save your thoughts & prayers for your associates who will be indicted.
Americans rank Barack Obama as best president of their lifetimes: Poll - ABC News - via @ABC @realDonaldTrump https:// abcn.ws/2uqE8mP
Bwa ha ha ha ha @GOP . The longes streak of job growth (94 months) was 78 months under @BarackObama and 16 months under @realDonaldTrump - are you seriously trying to take credit for something that Obama started and sustained for 62 months longer than Trump?
I have to confess . I was working 7days a week 12 hr days . I did not vote . If I had ! @realDonaldTrump Was my vote ! So ! that means even 1 more vote but he did not need it .
What's worse, the Power Panel on @PnPCBC took @realDonaldTrump at his word. We all know that Trump never tells the truth, so why would anyone base any analysis on what he says?
Complaining about nepotism whilst supporting Trump is next level hypocrisy @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump seems a little prickly the last few days. I wonder if those heel spurs are acting up.
@realDonaldTrump roger Stone gonna flip on you!
