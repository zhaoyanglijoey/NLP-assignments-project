@realDonaldTrump rally is more like the old fat white clowns on stage preforming for the highly uneducated, gullible audience
While you're at it @realDonaldTrump how about an #ExecutiveOrder to repeal the Freedom Act?

If @realDonaldTrump told his base to eat dog they would!
Minnesota Love @realDonaldTrump rallies
@CNN @MSNBC and network 'news' outlets ............ and the rest of the menagerie have all been bitching since @realDonaldTrump was elected Nov 8..........nonstop panties all in a wad pic.twitter.com/gyznB7Br45
@realDonaldTrump the fact that you signed this executive order does absolve you from having allowed these children to be separated from their families and put into cages. You are an evil, despicable man with no soul and there is going to be a very special place in hell for you. pic.twitter.com/DuwCbJyAhJ
@realDonaldTrump This is delusional. The entire world is laughing at us.
When was @realDonaldTrump EVER shown the least bit of #morality @NobelPrize
What exactly is hilarious about children who remain separated from their parents with no plan from @realDonaldTrump to reunite them?
@realDonaldTrump Hey Trump! You are the most loathed man in the USA. (Forgot you are not smart-that means hated in baby-hand talk). #TheResistance #FBR #BlueWave2018 #ResignNow #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain #WeDoNotBelieveYou
@realDonaldTrump this was on Canadian news, fox studio buying Disney is this true
As parody, this @CNN @CNNSitRoom headline would be moderately funny. @nbc @nbcsnl @SNLUpdate @ComedyCentral @TheDailyShow Unfortunately, this is real and it's accurate. That's not funny, it's tragic. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/aKgfFCrzpO
Nothing like a #MAGA party!!! We you back @realDonaldTrump !!!
This is so pathetic. Babies - BABIES! are being separated from their mothers, and still some @realDonaldTrump supporters choose to turn a blind eye.
@realDonaldTrump . Unbelievable!!! VOTE BLUE, for BIDEN/KENNEDY ticket, hopefully!!! pic.twitter.com/tnGsLFRW2l
@hughhewitt @RealJamesWoods @brithume @ByronYork @KimStrassel @MZHemingway @jack @realDonaldTrump @DennisPrager @PRyan @WSJ @jaketapper WAKE Up people, this is going in a VERY dangerous direction! Stop the bickering and the vitriol or someone is gonna get hurt from this BS.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #ReuniteFamiliesNow I want EVERY family put back together you horrific pig and released NOW @PressSec we will not stop until families are back together
So @realDonaldTrump spends the whole time blaming the Dems and saying his hands are tied and he can't do anything only to sign an exec order. And now we're supposed to be like OH YAY HE'S THE BEST WOW. TF out of my face with that shit, nah. #Done #ChangethePresident #Bye
. @realDonaldTrump said Stauber wasn't supposed to speak at rally. Stauber is reading from prepared, printed remarks.
@realDonaldTrump do Minnesota a favor and get out. #dflbluewave
Te voy a decir lo que nadie se quiere decir. @realDonaldTrump solo desea terminar con el libertinaje.

#TrumpDuluth Wow. That's a diverse crowd surrounding @realDonaldTrump ...one of the white guys is missing his politician hair
No thank you @realDonaldTrump disgusts me
At the end of the day, the road will end with a @realDonaldTrump shell company
@realDonaldTrump He will LIE about Anything! He Lies about EVERYTHING!
@realDonaldTrump Your EO is a complete fraud. It does nothing to bring together kids already separated from their parents. Second, a court must rule on all future separations. You are still going to Hell. #KeepFamliesTogether
You should all be charged with crimes against humanity. Trumps policy of separating children from parents at border was his idea, his implementation, his policy. @realDonaldTrump lies, distorts, and is the destruction of America, the land I love. #impeach
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for correcting course and pledging to keep immigrant families together. The more you lead with compassion, the more opportunities there will be to do great things.
#EvenAtMyLowestOfLows , I had more compassion than @realDonaldTrump
People followed what @realDonaldTrump ordered with no one questioning it. That should terrify every American. #TrumpIsAMonster #TrumpsAmerica #TrumpConcentrationCamps
Did you know that @realDonaldTrump totally Transformed the facilities that Obama left Stark,to colorful dormstyle rooms w posters, video games,beautiful clean beds and bedspreads etc..makes a Huge difference 4 a child going thru such trauma fr smugglers!
That's what he thinks. @realDonaldTrump thinks we've made noise up to now, just wait until word about this gets out.
God bless you for any influence you wielded upon @realDonaldTrump to bring to pass the EO signing today. Please follow up with him to ensure families already separated can be reunited.
So, @realDonaldTrump 's #tariffs are going to save American jobs eh? American #SolarEnergy company Suniva just filed for bankruptcy citing the tariffs as a direct cause. 100's lose their jobs. Oh, and China just told their farmers to increase soybean farming. Great job #MAGA
. @realDonaldTrump you and your goon squad have essentially kidnapped 2300 children. This is insane, you are single handedly destroying this country. You disgust me.
BOOM!!! @realDonaldTrump 'In two years I think I'll win MN EASY!!! #TrumpDuluth
@realDonaldTrump come to Pine City, MN!!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President.
Another #FeralAnimal folks...... @SecretService @DHSgov @FBI @realDonaldTrump
Our President @realDonaldTrump ROCKS!
@realDonaldTrump The correct way to use the word "infest" is this way. The Trump administration and cabinet are infested with liars and crooks.
@realDonaldTrump Blah. Blah. Blah
"We've got all night don't we! We're not going anywhere!" We aren't either @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ! We're going to watch in this house until you are finished! #MAGA Love you #PresidentTrump
@PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump thank you Mr. President for listening to the children! And Pastor D Scott for being a voice and trying to make a difference everywhere you go!
@realDonaldTrump in your case you can't fix stupid.I do mean you because you are not a smart man .
I bet @realDonaldTrump still owes you tooth fairy money. #TrumpCrimeFamily
So we no longer have "Zero Tolerance Policy"? AMERICA BREAKS IT'S OWN LAWS?! WOW! WHAT A HEADLINE! @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity WHO WINS? I'M BETTING ON MELANIA. MAMA BEAR PROTECTING HER CUB. AND SHE IS RIGHT TO.
@realDonaldTrump Trump: I've caused this huge, inhumane nightmare. The Dems are obstructing the "fix" which would appease me and cause more harm to the US. Blame them! Public outrage? Okay, I'll undo what I did and take credit for fixing it. Repeat.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence #Patriotism !
The longer @realDonaldTrump is in charge, the less of a country you will have! His replacement will be able to truly #MAGA .

@realDonaldTrump In the annals of history, you will forever be known as the man who separated children from their parents....just like Hitler....and you can't change it, you can't like about, it's a fact. #fecklessmoron
@realDonaldTrump your message of hate and fear has no place here in Minnesota. #ResistTrump #Resistance
Who are the mainstream media trying to fool with their statistical sleights of hand and delusional claims that Germany is a people's utopia of unlocked doors? The situation there is a mess, and they weren't shy about reporting it before @realDonaldTrump spoke out. pic.twitter.com/ulJ4Yti8Iw
So the executive order does not put the separated families back together? @realDonaldTrump is still being inhumane & unapologetic! The detained kids are traumatized forever. It is up to their parents to find them! Not #BeBest
I'm getting tired of social media. Tired of reading how all white people are garbage, actors saying @realDonaldTrump 's son should be raped, cops are monsters and criminals are victims. What is happening to our world?
This could be a huge turning point for us and #Mueller . Since he's at the heart of #MonsterInChief @realDonaldTrump 's crimes including his #TrumpRussia scandal, #MichaelCohen could have a lot of #TrumpTreason dirt that we need to know, like NOW! #CohenWillFlip #ItsMuellerTime

@realDonaldTrump Put the foot down on Mexico to FORCE them to stem the tide. And Asylum seekers are supposed to go to the FIRST country without conflict not pick and choose!
@realDonaldTrump I am so thankful for what you have done to MAGA but I would love to see more help for families w/ children on the Autism spectrum. My insurance won't cover social skills groups & many with much more needed assistance financially.
So do your job. Stopping illegal immigration will stop this situation. Obama administration was sued for doing the same thing @realDonaldTrump signed today. You people are using kids as political fodder.
Wish I was there!!! @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Let the Mueller investigaton reach its conclusion first. Not a good look for you Trump. I'm a supporter, but this is downright stupid. You haven't been exonerated of collusion yet. Put this one off if you have any brains.
I bet they are @realDonaldTrump has 52.9 million followers and at least half of them re tweeted it by know, most of the people eligible to vote in November saw it. On top of that he played them by creating the EO they tough he will never do. #QAnon #WWG1WGA

Perhaps @realDonaldTrump needs to focus on the campaign he won and the country he is screwing up before worrying about his next step. Oh wait, I believe declaring yourself as a candidate means you can receive campaign money years in advance. #followthemoney
Are you actually criticizing Emperor @realDonaldTrump ? I am shocked.
@CBSNLive this @realDonaldTrump rally is so inappropriate so I have to do myself a favor and change the channel.

We as a country should learn the lessons of history to not repeat the dark days of the mistakes made. But since @realDonaldTrump does not know history and is not willing to learn any lessons we are doomed to be shocked by him over and over again with cruel and abusive policies!
@realDonaldTrump Mr president I need your help. Blue Cross Blue shield has a God complex and needs to be brought to account. They blow off the surgery that would allow me to be a functioning member of society, deny me the non narcotic pain patch to reduce my pain and narcotics

Do we have any idea what @realDonaldTrump 's shenanigans have cost us -- i.e., expenses of administering the separations at border, housing, transporting people around, specialized child care centers for kids in Ny, etc.?

@realDonaldTrump My message to your racist ass for the day F you forever. Never ever my president. NEVER
@realDonaldTrump Declare a one mile strip along the southern border a national security issue and implement Marshall Law. Put 20,000 armed troops with the authorization to use deadly force if confronted (i.e. drug cartels and smugglers). Will be removed when the wall is built.
Did you call out @realDonaldTrump for his horrible policy move? NO
@realDonaldTrump you know what.....never mind #Lordhelp pic.twitter.com/wCQ2zs72jy
@realDonaldTrump America is better than your messed up ego. #WakeUpAmerica The executive order only stops the bleeding but does not stop the blood on your hands
@realDonaldTrump . And then there's God's judgment concerning you, Donald. You're 72? You need serious help, and not from anyone afraid of you. You need tough, wise people of unassailable integrity, and you must *listen* to them! Step 1 is admitting you have a problem.
@realDonaldTrump NO AMNESTY whatsoever. It will only invite millions of others to cross our borders ILLEGALLY in the hopes that we will be STUPID ENOUGH to do this again. We did it in the 80s and now look at where we are.
@ErinBurnett and @HardballChris are LOSERS. The ratings are once again with @FoxNews , which is showing the Minnesota @realDonaldTrump rally while @CNN and @MSNBC wallow in their collective mud with PIGS. Losers!

People frustrated often express such ideas in an attempt to get the other into a place of understanding. Meant to be illuminating not literal. @realDonaldTrump bullies for the apology & triples down on the lies. We are disadvantaged in that game.
Having watched that video that you put on twitter, obama did not agree with @realDonaldTrump on immigration. Obama said illegal immigrants would be deported. Under trump, illegal immigrants are treated like dogs in cages in an animal pound.
@realDonaldTrump if a person rode the top of the subway with their CHILDREN youth protection wpuld remove those kids. If I was homeless youth protection would remove my kids. Why does an illegal immigrant get better treatment? Now it will be FAMILY centers. So a guaranteed bed
If she sees @realDonaldTrump as any sort of competent businessman, I would question her competence
