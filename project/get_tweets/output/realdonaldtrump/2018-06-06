@realDonaldTrump Those are your grandchildren he wants to deport. Do you think maybe this bigotry and divisiveness has gone too freaking far NOW, Mr. President?? @IvankaTrump pic.twitter.com/etm9G4iBCT
What a WEAK person... Have some balls & show up like @KimKardashian did and have an intelligent discussion with @realDonaldTrump . Your too weak though....takes a strong woman like Kim & she held her head high after all the tolerant dems & liberals tried to destroy her.
Wrong, @realDonaldTrump . That was the British, NOT the Canadians. History about your own country during the War of 1812 is NOT exactly your strongest point, is it? What a way to greet a neighbouring foreign leader as well. Zero out of ten for tact. Wow... #TrumpFail
@realDonaldTrump I don't know if you believe me mr. President but other people have wrote the president I know mr. Bush NASA is clearly hiding things there is artificial stuff all over mars and I'm not talkin about pareidolia I'm talking about buildings statues writing on and on
Dear @realDonaldTrump , I'm just out of twitmo, where I was locked up thanks to your wonderful cult followers, so I'll be very careful with my wording: You're a fudging feces stain faced mommy hugger and I'd like you to get gently massaged from behind with a soft pool noodle.

You are a coward for disparaging @StormyDaniels stormy for her chosen profession. No matter what a parent still has to love there child despite the profession they choose. Not sure how any family or friends of your could be proud you are prostituted daily for @realDonaldTrump

The biggest irony of @realdonaldtrump commuting the life sentence of #AliceMarieJohnson is that the 1st person he pardoned as @POTUS was a sheriff who was indicted because he refused to stop racial profiling as ordered by a federal court. #MAGA #HeDoesntCare #MassIncarceration
Mr. President @realDonaldTrump make #Venezuela great again, please!
I am so glad you are against pedophilia and love all people. Me too. That is why I am for @realDonaldTrump He is not who the MSM says he is and it might be very important for you to do some research on who he really is. Things might make more sense. Try @zachhaller for facts

I'm still waiting for nutritionalists and research doctors come out with the news that not only were they wrong about a having bunch small meals a day and that you should actually eat 1 gigantic meal of all the foods they say are bad for us. Make it happen @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Anyone who supports vaccine mandates knowing Black children are injured 3 times more than all other races, and suffer regressive Autism 2:1 over all other races is a RACIST. Check yourself. If you attacked or mocked vax injury parents, you're despicable racist.

@realDonaldTrump why is it so hard to get a bed at the VA hospital in Charleston SC.. there is a 40 plus person wait there alone.. That is crazy !!! My dad cannot get care unless it is done at the VA.. He is stuck in Manning hospital because he cannot be released or transferred.

@BarackObama could care less about the men and women in Blue. Go back and review all of his racist sentiments, they are out there plain as day... @realDonaldTrump just pushing for Americanism by honoring the the RED,WHITE and BLUE. Sad that one can kneel, but state they care...
. @realDonaldTrump - for someone whose party has coopted patriotism - one would think you might try to get your historical facts sorted out-
@realDonaldTrump doesn't get it that most people were truly concerned about her well-being, especially after learning she'd been hospitalized. That was a long time for a first lady to be not seen. @POTUS should be thanking the public for their concern about @FLOTUS .
@CNN @Acosta @ChrisCuomo @realDonaldTrump @Scaramucci
It is sad to see @ErinBurnett and @KirstenPowers hold #StormyDaniels up as a good role model and calling her detractors misogynous, but what else do you expect from @CNN ? They hate @realDonaldTrump so much they expect us to believe Daniels is a mainstream "businesswoman".
American people will be handing out pink slips to all Democrat congressmen Their newest strategies are trying to take over Governor and State Attorney General Seats to file all kind of nonsense lawsuits against @realDonaldTrump administration
@realDonaldTrump Former NYC mayor is now a BORe (box of rocks), or in layman's language: dumber than dog dirt.

June 26 NYC Primary....it is ALL ABOUT MAKING BELIEVE HER TRASH " She cares" @realDonaldTrump
I'm really happy for her and her family. I hope that at some point @realDonaldTrump has an opportunity 2 enact prison reforms at the federal level. As an example to the states. Violent criminals lock them up. But we need many nonviolent criminals to be productive members of their
@HowardStern is a turncoat to everyone who made him famous and supported his show in it's heyday, including our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump . Trump needs no input from Howard and I'm sure has erased him from his speed dial. Thanks but not thanks.
@realDonaldTrump @Flotus When Trump & Melania hold hands or show any sign of compassion between them it looks staged. They might be sincere but it looks 100% Fake.
Only here's the thing, he didn't do this for Alice. He did it for Kim and a big photo op with Kim. Celebrity: one of the very few things @realDonaldTrump actually understands, or appreciates.

One good thing about @realDonaldTrump on twitter is, the world can see he is a narcissistic sociopath & an unstable moron. He publicly broadcasts it in his multiple tweets. He clearly has no conscience, nor feels embarrassment & continues to embarrass himself & America.

Ok which celebrity is going to the White House to ask @realDonaldTrump to pardon Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey?
As a Cavaliers fan, I still say bravo to Steve Kerr who has a greater understanding of patriotism and leadership than @realDonaldTrump .
He did. He "uninvited" only, because the whole team didn't accept the "invite"...only 10 were said (by manager/coach) to be attending. With @realDonaldTrump being all about the #numbers , you know he couldn't take that. He had to save face and make it seem like he dissed them.

So, if @realDonaldTrump seriously thinks it was us Canadians who burned down the White House in 1812, I think he needs to go back and take a History lesson. Canada was not even a country until 1867. Some may have been future Canadians, but thats about it.
Here's the thing @realDonaldTrump . You exhibit all the classic signs of an abuser, and I'm not going to be bullied into not caring if your wife disappears again. You're fucking crazy and I don't trust you. You hear?
@realDonaldTrump Barron probably could've told you that. Damn.
Perhaps North Korea will cancel the summit again. With such an insult, I would tell @realDonaldTrump to go f**k himself.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump from 'yo 81 year old Granny: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
@realDonaldTrump I just want to know: are you really as uninformed as your tweets make you out to be? Did you even go to school or did you just pay someone to go for you?
So why did @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Diss Mr. and Mrs. Khan? And why the shade against Sen McCaine for being captured.
@realDonaldTrump in what year did Canada gain independence? Hint it was after 1812
Thank you @KimKardashian but unfortunately #aliceJohnson is just another pawn in the Trump game. Strategy to win the Black vote. @realDonaldTrump will never change his disdain for Black and Brown people. #ByAnyMeansNecessaryToWin #dontTrustHim

@realDonaldTrump Here is a perfect opportunity to show your humanity and to silence your critics! The pizza delivery guy who just got detained by ICE ! Intervene on his behalf, you will be a hero and show them that you are not trying to break up families, only deport creeps!
If @NancyPelosi supports MS-13 then I guess @realDonaldTrump supports drug trafficking!
Why would Rudy say such a thing this close to the summit, @realDonaldTrump ? Very doubtful, and NO country would want to see such a statement. Sad.
@realDonaldTrump please take Kim Jong Un a Big Mac.
Thank you Eric! I appreciate your compliment and think its great that you support @realDonaldTrump as a Democrat! Facts all the way!

@realDonaldTrump would be wise to bone up on history before accusing Canada of being responsible for burning down the White House during the war of 1812! We know he won't but DJT needs to apologize to all of Canada!!!

Hey @realDonaldTrump : You want to commute the sentences of everyone serving life for non-violent drug offenses? Or are you just going to do it for the one @KimKardashian told you about?
