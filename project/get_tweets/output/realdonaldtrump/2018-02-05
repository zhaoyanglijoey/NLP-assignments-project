Can't wait to see @realDonaldTrump excuse for not releasing it.
@POTUS Delusional Little world is falling apart Next to #Impeaching @realDonaldTrump and sending him to #MS13 #FederalPrison #Collusion @Rusiia Investigation #Hacking @DNC @HillaryClinton Emails with @VladimirPutin @wikileaks #Rigging2016Elections - CIA Warns #2018RigElections
@realdonaldtrump President Trump, please do not declassify dimms memo because I am sure it's filled with lies and obstruction!!! They like to lie obstruct and destruct!!!!
#ReleaseTheFISAApplication what's so secret about this application? @realDonaldTrump @TGowdySC @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @marthamaccallum @IngrahamAngle
@realDonaldTrump Things you don't get to decide: if not clapping is treasonous, if saying 'no collusion' hundreds of times means there was no collusion, when the investigation into your obstruction of justice and your conspiracy with the Russians is complete.
Hey, @realDonaldTrump , largest Dow point drop in American History, you taking credit for that too or nah?
The corrupt traitorous @realDonaldTrump administration is against states rights. And white supremacists who want to keep using a weed to beat down people who are non white The biggest gateway drug out there is alcohol The worsts drug epidemic was sold to America by big pharma pic.twitter.com/d4kwKn3CkD
What's wrong with you guys? You knew this would make national news. I have an nine year old child who I'll have to explain this to before someone else brings it up in front of her. This isn't about freedom of speech anymore, and it's not a 'phobia.' It's hate. @realDonaldTrump
Retweeted Nancy Pelosi ( @NancyPelosi ): Every American should be alarmed by how @realDonaldTrump is working to... https:// fb.me/6czAEQw5V
Stock market plummets over 1,000 points. Most ever in a day. So would this be @realDonaldTrump doing? #StockMarketCrash
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr. Big Business Man - how do you explain this one you lying sack of shit?!? #resign #NotMyPresident #dow pic.twitter.com/OwQIWOQaHu

So, can't let it go huh Nancy? I wouldn't show you my tax return either. As far as Paul's tweet, yeah it was stupid but I'm already seeing a benefit. How about joining @tedcruz and make them permanent? The Dow is up thousand(s) since he took office. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I'll get your cannon.
Hey, @realDonaldTrump , thanks for tanking the Dow more than 1,800 points in two days. That's history making! I used to think the market wasn't driven up or down by just one person. But, you've convinced me that everything that's happened in the economy since 11/16 is due to you.
I totally agree @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/ftd5GS4HiD
@RepAdamSchiff you ARE NOTHING except a #LIAR . You have no credibility with the American people & in 2018, the #Democrats will find out how much we the people despise you & your party. U r a liar, LEAKER & the @DNC is BUSTED. cuffs r coming #MAGA #Trump2020 @realDonaldTrump
Any comment on your amazing influence on the Stockmarket @realDonaldTrump ?

@realDonaldTrump @PressSec ....God too, I expect!
The Market Meltdown matches @realDonaldTrump 's Meltdown. That's why it's not a good idea to brag & accept ALL responsibility for the success of the stock market. What can go up can always come back down.

Hey, @realDonaldTrump , how about that stock market today, huh?
Government judging their own people doesn't work let the real courts decide @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Any thoughts on the #FalconHeavy launch scheduled for tomorrow at THE Kennedy Space Center? #GYATM
Still waiting to see who @realDonaldTrump blames for the recent stock market volatility - maybe @BarackObama or even @HillaryClinton - we know he only takes credit for all time highs
@realDonaldTrump Such a disgrace and cheater to wives and cheater to hard working Americans, Bankrupt King!

It just be Obama's fault because there is no way @realDonaldTrump and his #StableGenius running of our country has anything to do with it. #TrumpCrash
Why is @realDonaldTrump so quiet? I hear he called Tom Brady's wife and asked her what it was like to be married to a Loser. She replied: Ask Melania. #FBR #FBResistance #MAGA
He needs to look in the mirror and at his sons about that. Not liking your policies or your face doesn't make someone treasonous. @realDonaldTrump Grow up
@realDonaldTrump I don't pay taxes to be called treasonous, Mr. President. Seems like you need a civics class on how democracy and dissent work.
Chris Wallace waltzes w/ Leon Panetta to co-opt the moral high ground on FISA memo [pretending to advocate for law & order] while casting aspersions on @realDonaldTrump . This is how leftists fool the uninformed. Would love to see @ThomasWictor break it down. @FoxNewsSunday
So, can anyone find a pic of @realDonaldTrump rally in Ohio today? Interested in attendance.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, keep doing a great job. much appreciated

I think @RepMimiWalters takes after @realDonaldTrump - doesn't read much. She'll do whatever he does and won't bat an eye that her constituents disagree.
@realDonaldTrump , @RepDLamborn , @SenCoryGardner release the democratic memo. Grow a spine and seek justice vs going and kissing trumps ass
@realDonaldTrump The alternative is people dieing on the streets if nothing is done.
@realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes T is for treason, R is for retarded, U is for under-whelming, M is for miscreant and P is for the Pussy you are. #FuckTrump #FuckNunes #CurrentTraitorsFutureCriminals

You forgot the @realDonaldTrump
I think our country would be much better served if @realDonaldTrump and the rest of the government would focus on the important issues instead of childish disagreements and pointless investigations. Focus on the budget and running the country.
@realDonaldTrump buddy - as a proud but very nonwhite Brit - let me tell you are so bloody wrong mate. Get yer facts in order. Stop watching Fox TV!
@realDonaldTrump , are you able to go 1 day without belittling, bullying or name calling people who disagree with your policies? You ARE a disgrace, how can anyone respect You??!
@realDonaldTrump , @SpeakerRyan , @SenateMajLdr and many of Congressional GOP are ALL TRAITORS and Putin loyalist! GO TO HELL! pic.twitter.com/1jjitVaTJg
The best way to explain how @realDonaldTrump got elected is to look at America during obummer's time. Barry is the reason @realDonaldTrump is now our President!!
@realDonaldTrump hey, tinyhandstrump, the Dow has experienced a historic 2-day drop. What did you do?
@realDonaldTrump Something that TrumpTits can really claim. He has presided over the largest one-day fall in the Dow's 122 year old history. I am sure this will give him lots to shout about... "real news"
Hey @realDonaldTrump , at what time today did you delete this little gem? #loadthecannon pic.twitter.com/K7sWymOAX1

@realDonaldTrump Hey, Fake President, the stock market has been tumbling, and it is ALL your fault. Traitor!
I'll take one of the eagles place! @realDonaldTrump
I'm pretty sure @realDonaldTrump will be taking responsibility for the Dow Jones drop. Probably working on a tweet right now.... Hey, has anybody seen my meds?
@cnnbrk @realDonaldTrump - DOW DROPS NEARLY 1,200 POINTS - TRUMP IS A #LOSER - #BIGLY !
So Nancy, if @realDonaldTrump refuses to approve the Democrat Memo, will you be thanking him profusely for dutifully exercising his constitutional responsibilities? If not, why not?
. @realDonaldTrump Any DACA deal needs to help American workers, but the White House proposal delays the relief for at least 15 years. Please support H.R. 4760 instead!! #KeepYourPromise

Obviously @BarackObama snuck back into the @WhiteHouse today and pulled down on the lever that @realdonaldtrump uses to make the stock market go so bigly.
While @realDonaldTrump flings the dead cat on the table, accusing the #Democrats of treason because they did not clap during his #StateOfTheUnion speech, do have a look at the stock markets and Dow Jones. #Trump #TrumpStockCrash
. @realDonaldTrump we're waiting. And the way you're throwing around 'treasonous' to describe the Democrats because they didn't clap for you--censure is coming and soon, prison.

@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Hey you treasonous bastards. Where are your tweets about the stock drop while on your watch? Awefully quiet comrades. Haha. That sure shit up the mutant dipshits. Losers one and all. Jail will be perfect for you losers.
Ok @realDonaldTrump Dems and Libs will give you credit for the historic Dow Jones industrial average plunge- biggest one day drop in its history! #StockMarketCrash
So it's @realDonaldTrump in the astronaut's suit that will be in @elonmusk #FalconHeavy rocket which is launching tomorrow! @SpaceX pic.twitter.com/oYsIvFjwH8
I willing to bet that @realDonaldTrump says he will not release it "because it contains too much classified information that could hurt America."
If @realDonaldTrump gets credit for rise in #StockMarket then he gets blame for single biggest drop in history. This is one time when he can claim the biggest, the most historic--failure. But he only attacks DOJ & FBI, insults hard working & bipartisan members of Congress.
Running away from serving your country in a time of need sounds like a bigger case of treason Or how about if you colluded with a foreign government to manipulate an election? #BoneSpurs #TrumpRussia #Trump @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/UjlUMc3f5N

And, just an FYI, @realDonaldTrump was never under surveillance. Carter Page was under surveillance and that started before he even joined @realDonaldTrump 's campaign, and that was because he had contact with 2 known Russian spies that had been under surveillance first.
@realDonaldTrump So mkt is down for the 2nd day. What do you have to say now? Oh right, you're on to burying our FBI. We're sitting ducks w/o them & the CIA. You like starting fires & walk away. #pathetic #sad #embarrasment
