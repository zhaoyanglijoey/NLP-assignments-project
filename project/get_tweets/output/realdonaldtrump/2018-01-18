@realDonaldTrump No DACA No Deal shut it down a** holes!!
Fuck @realDonaldTrump yo
The American people are calling bullshit. Obama made sure the military was paid when you tried shutting the government down then. @realDonaldTrump could do the same thing but the @GOP is holding kids and the military as political hostages. BAD LEADERSHIP.
American people are not stupid Mr. McConnell. @realDonaldTrump , @SpeakerRyan and you have total control of Washington DC. Blaming anybody but yourselves is laughable. @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @MSNBC @CNN @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @SteveRattner @jaketapper @Eugene_Robinson @WillieGeist
Why is it @POTUS @realDonaldTrump that in a Gov't shutdown that Congress & Senate still get paid Where Our Military , those who fight for Our Freedoms .. their pay is delayed ? This needs to be changed immediately !
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS
This is the easiest choice ever...the ULTIMATE King of Fake News is YOU, @realDonaldTrump and the organization that pushed the MOST FAKE NEWS last year is the White House under your administration. Have a nice day! #Fakies #FakePresident pic.twitter.com/0s0AbU321R

@realDonaldTrump Accosta is now doing fake news to compensate for CNN winning your 'Media Awards'- he needs to know that just because someone calls him a monkey he doesn't need to join the Monkey's Union. Why did the media cover your award ceremony? Too funny
Because women are intelligent enough to know that using a social media platform to risk all life on Earth into nuclear war, as an excuse to threaten everyone to adhere to @RealDonaldTrump 's political agenda, is unwise and dangerous. #WomenDeliver
Love how you keep church and state matters separate. How many abortions do you think @realDonaldTrump has forced his mistresses to get in the past 50 years?
@realDonaldTrump You can't even #MakeADeal with you @GOP @freedomcaucus @HouseGOP allies!! You are a fraud in EVERY sense of the term you #ShitHolePresident pic.twitter.com/6nRvm7ZoHb
Anyone over the age of 40 already knew @realDonaldTrump from his decades of sex and business scandals. #MAGA is a myth; the @GOP is playing a new generation for fools. #DoubleStandard - Obama or Clinton would've been out of office by now. #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/qMMAkEK3ak
That @realDonaldTrump likes to be spanked is way, way, way too much information. I feel like I need to step away from the table.

Sitting on the train when the woman next to me glances over at my phone and sees me scowling at @realDonaldTrump 's Twitter account: Her: "What a fucking asshole." Me: "Word." Then we had a fist bump.

@realDonaldTrump Our disgrace of a London Mayor, your friend Sadiq Khan is planning to visit the USA.. He has some interesting friends. I suggest you investigate him before letting him through Passport Control.

@realDonaldTrump @ABC do NOT blame Democrats for GOVT shutdown. This is ALL ON YOU! Republicans control it all and they SUCK.
@jeffsessions PLEASE Do NOT let @realDonaldTrump answer Mueller's questions, it's clearly a trap from EVERY angle

Hey Dumbass @realDonaldTrump where is the letter from Mueller Exonerating you?

@realDonaldTrump Your not fat, knocked up by Putin maybe but not fat. Your still a ass.
Looks like balancing the Budget would be easy if our illustrious Congress would discontinue all the BS we payout....then there would be money to go around! @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/vfZx2SwE9D
. @realDonaldTrump @GOP Nothing will happen to the Military in a shut down. They carry on. But the @GOP will do it to interrupt smooth receipt of social security checks....
. @Judgenap : You are transparently obvious in ur enmity for . @realDonaldTrump - giving any credence to #FusionGPS testimony + phony #TrumpDossier is to spread Democrat Propoganda. Go have dinner with #MorningJoe and his doxy, Mika. Done with you! #FoxNews #SpecialReport
THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump for MAGA! Got our taxes done. Will be getting back more than we EVER have. Will definately help when we buy our home. Thank you for sticking up for the deplorables!!
There have been racist presidents in the past; and corrupt ones, and stupid ones; but never all at the same time. And at least, those presidents actually cared about the country. @realDonaldTrump is a miserable failure that only cares about itself.

Wish you were more like #Napoleon ! Lets get $ hit done!!!! @realDonaldTrump . But I LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
Mr. President @realDonaldTrump please I implore you do not allow yourself to be interviewed by Robert Mueller, it's a trap! It will not serve you well to do that, they will use your words to try to destroy you. You're doing a fantastic job and may God Bless You and protect you!
@realDonaldTrump your ratings are worse than @wolfblitzer
Spanked with a rolled up copy of Forbes - to borrow one of the president's favorite phrases - "like a dog"? Upon further reflection that $130K is starting to look like a bargain, @realDonaldTrump
Still no arrests? @realDonaldTrump
If the government is to shut down, IMO, it is very selfish and politicians are not thinking about the constituents who voted them in to represent them. They are only thinking about themselves and their own agendas. Put your hate for @realDonaldTrump aside and think about the ppl.
@realDonaldTrump I viewing the Brett Baier show 2nite (1/18/2018), Napolitano stated that you should NEVER sit down to be interviewed by Mueller. I agree. He is looking for any opportunity to trap you. Why Talk to them...? ''No'' lawyer would allow you to jeapordize yourself..!

Thanks @realDonaldTrump
About that @BretBaier interview with (Gen.) Chief of staff Kelly, Wow. To me if all this was reported in Context, this shows that our @POTUS is Strategically More Adept than even the great Gen. Kelly! (I had a similar concern or thought B4 @realDonaldTrump response.) #media
Republicans control both sides of Congress & the Executive branch. Failure to act sits squarely on their shoulders. @GOP , pass a clean DACA bill & 10 year extension of CHIP @realDonaldTrump is an albatross around your necks, put country over party to prevent #Republicanshutdown

@realDonaldTrump You need General Kelly much more than he needs you. Your comment about him makes you look small. Disappointed!
Aww, come on JAKE......you made because you didn't get a award for @realDonaldTrump ?

@jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump The California AG needs to be arrested NOW and prosecuted for sedition. Sedition is overt conduct, such as speech and organization, that tends toward insurrection against the established order. SET AN EXAMPLE
Our people should never vote for a Democrap ever again. They are bad animals. @realDonaldTrump
That's not really fair and you have to give @realDonaldTrump his due...he's the fakest douche in THE WORLD.

Is there anything more inept than a #GOP that can't get a full year budget passed 4 months into #FY2018 ? @realdonaldtrump @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @senateGOP
@realDonaldTrump Time to bring in professional People to create a real budget for our economy, many companies can handle this job, the time has come to let the pros take over the numbers
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump thought he was making great deals all his life and never even suspected that he's just been running a laundry .... Is he that stupid ?
Please take to the floor disclosing documents from DOJ and end this narrative against our @realDonaldTrump and our constitution...this has to stop now..counting on all of you to make it right.. @TGowdySC please assist them.. we the people need to know truth..enought

So....does @realDonaldTrump have a subscription to #Forbes or does he only buy the ones with him on the cover?
@realDonaldTrump keeps citing the military when discussing possible shutdown, implying that the military will also be shut down. Fear mongering, plain & simple. Essential spending such as military is not affected by a shutdown.
#RT @realDonaldTrump : House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!
The #WhiteHouse led by @realDonaldTrump The @HouseGOP led by @SpeakerRyan The @SenateGOP led by @SenateMajLdr control ALL levers of gov't. Who's to blame for gov't shutdown? YES, BLAME the @GOP ! The OBSTRUCTIONIST @freedomcaucus
Wake up dude. It's easy to vote on principle when u know the outcome beforehand or know ur vote doesn't actually matter. This is the difference @realDonaldTrump has brought to the shithole chambers in DC. He isn't interested in passing problems on to the next prez. Get it done
Now the SOB wants to regulate something? @realDonaldTrump will get us all killed, one way or another.
