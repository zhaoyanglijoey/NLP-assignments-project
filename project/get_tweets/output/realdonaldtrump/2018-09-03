@realDonaldTrump You should look in the mirror, or at a video of yourself. Your mouth looks EXACTLY like an ass hole. Very fitting!!!!
Trump blasts Sessions over GOP congressmen indictments @CNNPolitics https:// cnn.it/2Q4Ak4L UNDER @realDonaldTrump , 13 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud and making false statements are OK. ALSO using campaign funds for personal use, falsifying records are OK.
Amen. And thank God for @realDonaldTrump
True. Do you think @realdonaldtrump is trying to change people's opinions of him (persuasion) or simply appealing to his base?
@realDonaldTrump you need to hire Alan Dershowitz
@realDonaldTrump the pussy grabber thinks the answer to older men taking advantage of girls is to force pregnancy and get parental rights over that baby girl #prochoice and talk about how to hold the man responsible and not need #welfare

Man don't nobody take this clown @realDonaldTrump serious. Probability is they (Putin) are working together any damn way!
Think Colen Kaepernick and his kneeling. Even the Director was for leaving the flag out of the information. Knowing where Damien Chazelle (the director) is from helps understanding he's a mad DemocRAT, a chop at @realDonaldTrump using the picture.
@realDonaldTrump proving he's no stable genius.
@realDonaldTrump I feel like some American States are bleeding financially by a thousand Corrupt Politicians cuts. Draining our Financial blood! (STATE/ &Fed taxes if they can get it!! ) Fed Workers Also, Like Hud @SecretaryCarson 'Found' $500 Billion a Stash a while back?
@realDonaldTrump can you just strip the NFL of THIER non profit tax exempt status? It's b.s. anyway

11. An intelligent man speaks when he has to say something. A wise man speaks when he has something to say. 12. An intelligent man sees everything as relative. A wise man sees everything as related. @realDonaldTrump @ananavarro @billmaher @MMFlint
How can several in @realDonaldTrumps company be indicted, charged criminally etc... Yet Donald knows NOTHING Come on when was the last time all your friends got in trouble and you knew nothing, think about it folks!! I call bullshit on you @realDonaldTrump
Tweeter locked me out. SAD! The stuff @realDonaldTrump says everyday and nothing. me they lock my account.
So. Stop. Him, @JeffFlake !Start by halting the man nominated to the Supreme Court specifically because he does not believe in holding sitting presidents accountable for crimes. If you will not take action against @realDonaldTrump then you are part of the criminally complicit @GOP
@jeneps you keep liking @realDonaldTrump 's tweets. You are now unfollowed.
True! It's like the Nazi of the House @SpeakerRyan said "we dont care!". It's now RNP-RUSSIAN NAZI PARTY former GOP! RNP is lawless,morally bankrupt & in Putin's pocket,traitors to our country!

@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President. I'm a rarity. A Republican Comedian who is willing to devote 100% of my time to help you win mid term and 2020 elections. I pray for you and will do whatever I can to help.
No one in that family served thus country, @SenJohnMcCain has two sons on active duty! The coward @realDonaldTrump took deferrments so other could serve and die in this country's name! Trump showed nothing but utter contempt and disrespect while he was alive and passed. pic.twitter.com/9E4wUjfyrI

@Nike #JustDoIt boycott the hell out of #nike for supporting this #racist anti-law enforcement malcontent. Unbelievable that Nike would support #Kapernick . Never ever will I purchase another #nike product #shutdowntheswoosh #justdontdoit @realDonaldTrump please call out NIKE pic.twitter.com/u5RGJ5eACd
I'm loving watching you unravel, @realDonaldTrump . Not as much as I will love watching you get ousted by vote or arrest, but it's still hilarious to watch a loser fall apart as the walls close in.
#Trump says the things the idiots in this country are thinking. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Nike sucks
Because @realDonaldTrump tweeted, I just saved $2 to donate to @RAICESTEXAS to help fight family separation at the border!
Ron Paul 2020 no more terrorist supporting Neocons. I can't believe I fell for the Neocon @realDonaldTrump

The three most painful things a human can experience: 1. Being burned alive 2. Giving birth 3. Realizing Donald Trump is indeed President. Feel free to change the order based on personal experiences. @realDonaldTrump #Trump #MAGA #ImpeachTrump
After trumps tweets today attacking our rule of law and constitution, he doesn't even deserve to nominate someone t the highest court in our rule of law based DEMOCRACY.. @realDonaldTrump @#-
@realDonaldTrump Never Nike!
No matter your politics, Sessions is executing his duties. TFB for @realDonaldTrump The more Sessions keeps doing his job, the harder it becomes for Trump to dump him - especially since he has no self control and can't help but tweeting.
@realDonaldTrump You should totally call Putin and ask him what to do
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations! pic.twitter.com/OFFJhQ0CvO
America is paying the price with Your deal with Iran and all that money they got! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Seriously @tedcruz it IS &@$%ed up. The whole Republican Party is &@$%ed up. If @realDonaldTrump had said about me what he said about Heidi, my real man husband would have throat punched him, btw.
Well, @realDonaldTrump enjoys causing pain, suffering and misery. Letting people die in hurricanes, caging children, cutting wages and deregulating overtime, etc. are pluses in his book.

It's only a matter of time b4 the lft start siding w the 911 terrorist's stating tht @realDonaldTrump is causing a new rash of discrimination against Muslim's... Therefore causing radical Islamic's 2 defend their honor.. We ALL know it's comin.
They don't know what @realDonaldTrump did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so correct!
There is an ongoing federal investigation that @realDonaldTrump may be implicated in. No one he recommends to a court that would decide the fate of his verdict should be confirmed until after the investigation. This is basic logic. cc: @SenateDems @SenateGOP @SenSchumer #StepItUp

Keep it up w/ boycotts & bans, #Liberals . It's bullying & intellectually weak overreactions that got #Trump elected in first place. Half the country tired of liberals labeling every person & viewpoint they don't like as racist/sexist/homophobic/xenophobic. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump how much $$$ did Deutsche Bank give you? How about Bank of Cypress? @SecretaryRoss knows all about that! Crooks!!!

9. An intelligent man freely gives unsolicited advice. A wise man keeps his counsel until all options are considered. 10. An intelligent man understands what is being said. A wise man understands what is left unsaid. @realDonaldTrump @ananavarro @MMFlint @billmaher
No. Will you ever learn about @realDonaldTrump and who he is?
@realDonaldTrump - you should BUILD A WALL to save $$$ NYC and its surrounding BIGLY populated region at sea level from the #climatechange rising ocean. You'd be BIGLIER than the Great Wall of Gina!! You'd be famous for CENTURIES! A Hadrian - not a Nero pic.twitter.com/DPchuJewnk
@realDonaldTrump Why aren't YOU (Mr Prez) TAKING AWAY any exemption that N.F.L. owners have over them letting players kneel for our National Anthem? They're slapping ALL veterans, current soldiers and ALL police and firemen in the FACE!!!

Don't buy @Nike and for sure won't now. The kiss of @realDonaldTrump coming their way...
We know @realDonaldTrump is evil, bigoted, uncaring/unkind/heartless, under-educated and just plain stupid so could it be possible that his original logo was supposed to be: ACME America Great Again and he just mucked that up too?
If @realdonaldtrump simply stopped tweeting & speaking about what he considers to be personal attacks and witchhunts against him, would the public view him...
Hey @realDonaldTrump ....yes you will be kissing my fat ass 2nite! My new brand of toilet paper. pic.twitter.com/Es9VK3pT0i
Oh David, haven't U heard. @realDonaldTrump is helping put food on the table & paying a living wage $15hr to minorities, even if it is only for 2 hrs. This is what @POTUS pays stand-ins for his Indoctrination Rallies. Hey #MAGA are U getting Ur $15 bucks? pic.twitter.com/H911TtpfmC
He is absolutely a threat and he will bring all of these upper echelon criminals to their knees. He is just what America needs! #ilovemypresident @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump The reality challenged politicians in South Africa need to leave the farmers who grow their food alone. If the farmers lands are stolen, the SA economy will implode. Those getting the lands will lack farm skills & investments will disappear.
@realDonaldTrump you gon throw away your Nike arm sleeves too??
@realDonaldTrump @Google look at this. Which side do you find yourself on? #LaborDay #MAGA #WWG1WGA @jack @Breaking911 Watch https:// youtu.be/fqq4_9aGr6U
@realDonaldTrump Don't start a war with #Syria . Support #Assad because he's fighting ISIS and Islamists while the US and its neocons are supporting terrorists. Don't let the neocons destroy your presidency and ruin all the good you are doing.
Two days after @MeghanMcCain gave a eulogy for her father that was also a stunning and well deserved rebuke to @realDonaldTrump , @Nike and @Kaepernick7 handed another stellar rebuke to Cadet Bonespurs when they unveiled their 30th anniversary #justdoit campaign featuring.
How old are you like 12, if my original tweet was they are only going to pick 3 now and it would be Bryson, Tiger and Phil. When they pick the 4th it is likely Tony. Tony will not be one of the 3 picked tomorrow. BTW, I am a conservative. Go @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump is so dumb that he has no clue what obstruction of justice is and to top things off does not even know what is in the constitution.
Change both your account name and your @name in settings to become little more anonymous. Disable your location. And report and block any who threaten you. Also include @realDonaldTrump in your tweets. Good luck. We are rooting for you
Sure Donnie, what it takes to let you sleep in the office, you just go ahead and Tweet it out. All hail @realDonaldTrump
The Canadians attacking @JustinTrudeau over #NAFTA negotiations are undermining our position & playing into @realDonaldTrump 's hands. #Strictlybusiness .

Truth. When will the @GOP stop worrying about getting support from @realDonaldTrump and his intellectual black hole of a base and start trying to fix the damage he is doing to the country? You all need to do what's right and stop being complacent.
