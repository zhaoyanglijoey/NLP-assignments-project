#hatetrump @cnn @realDonaldTrump @TrumpHaters Mr Trump, it's shameful that you brought all your baggage with you to the office of the President.

@realDonaldTrump IS a racist. his words and actions say so over and over again. The POTUS is held up to the highest standards and @realDonaldTrump has failed over and over again to achieve any semblance of decorum. He is completely unfit for office and in essence, so are you.
@realDonaldTrump says he wants immigrants from Norway, which is ironic considering they have a universal healthcare system that the @GOP hates so much.
"Kitchen table talk", "locker room talk", it's amazing how much of this talk @realDonaldTrump does considering that he's never in either position. Unfortunately this is not the normal "White House talk".

Sad when you got a democrat like @SenatorDurbin who lied what @realDonaldTrump said;he is just another lier and one of the swamp idiots that needs to be forced out of senate by the voters;total jerk.

Hey @realDonaldTrump Russian hackers are now attempting to get into the US Senate email servers. Are you going to continue to ignore this invasion by a foreign government on our country? Or do they, perhaps, have your blessing?
Once again, @SpeakerRyan demonstrates that he had no balls! What @realDonaldTrump said needs to be condemned unconditionally. Unfortunately, it seems as if GOP leadership agrees with the crass and vulgar things Trump said. Trump is a racist & Ryan continues to protect/enable him.
