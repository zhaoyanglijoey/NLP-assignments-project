Huge crowd outside @realDonaldTrump rally in Houston. Think Antifa wants to start shit in Texas tonight? Antifa scumbags don't know squat about strength in numbers. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Donald dont take and wait too long, send the military apaches and tanks for shock and awe. this is an invasion and act of war I feel. we trust you. but we have your back and are there if you need us. The Americans voting red. we will not let the Dems win.
Watching our Great President @realDonaldTrump in Houston! What an enthusiastic crowd. Hey Betco @RepBetoORourke you can't come close to this! Adios!
Now if you are watching the Texas rally and see Ted Cruz and now Our President Trump enter the stage you will have chill bumps and goosebumps and pride in the United States of America! I love USA. I love our president. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump is our hero watching the #houstonRally
Ted Cruz surprised me. He was willing to let the past be the past and move forward to support @realDonaldTrump . He thought of what he could do to benefit his state and the American people rather than letting words from the past affect Americas future. Smart.
Did you see that they almost kissed #BeautifulTed and @realDonaldTrump
I have such happy tears as I watch the people of Texas all smiles as they welcome our GREAT President @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Question. Are we seeing enemy combatants among this stream of immigrants who are going to try to enter our country? If not, we definitely may see criminals breaking our sovereignty, laws, and how about international law? Just wondering.
Sounds like @realDonaldTrump is making it up as he goes, again.

In debate, really shitty FL GOP Gov candidate was asked if @realDonaldTrump was a good role model for children - so naturally, he answered by blathering about the US Embassy in Israel.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President. I know you don't have time to read all your tweets. But, I know this much. This so called "Caravan" is nothing more the an "Invasion" and it's test of your resolve and I back you 100% on what ever you do. pic.twitter.com/XnkGiDX9iM

As a senator / congress member it is your job to adhere to the U.S. Constitution & base your work upon the words our founding fathers painstakingly laid out for us! #mollietibbetts @ScrewedHumans @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump @marklutchman pic.twitter.com/QNq3nUU2zf
@realDonaldTrump The liar, there have no riots in Californa since 1992. Trump is a DAMN LIAR, Fraud, con artist, mob supporter, conspirator, mentally challenge and likely a Fricking Traitor. I pity people vote for his interest. #WeThePeople #TheResistance
uh oh @realDonaldTrump called himself a "Nationalist". That's the last straw, I mean we ALL know that he just meant to say he's proud of the U.S. but what if he really was "signaling" the imagined and fake underground racists that rule every liberal city?
That's it @realDonaldTrump , I've had pic.twitter.com/rEwrnhwyG5
I grew up not knowing my father, i grew up being molested and Gay, idk how to be a man cause no one was there to show me, A woman can't teach a boy to be a man. So to imagine these kids separated from their parents is breaking @realDonaldTrump Don't care
I'm shocked, shocked to find out @realDonaldTrump lied
Here's the Obama rally in Las Vegas I promised I'd send you. I went to yours and his both. Your messages offer respectively, one of hate and one of hope. That is why I will do everything in my power to the #BlueWave vote against you. @realDonaldTrump https:// youtu.be/gseeust-v4I
@realDonaldTrump is the President of the United States, and he's doing a very good job. pic.twitter.com/DOUCGOoviT
Surely you are not comparing this statement by Obama to the frothy mouthed rants about a caravan full of brown criminals and middle easterners coming to get us that @realDonaldTrump is using to scare people into voting for lying @tedcruz ? #BetoForTexas
Watching the news and reporters calling him out @realDonaldTrump on many things he has said and no answers was a thing of beauty.
I hope @realDonaldTrump wins the lottery!
And there might be lions and tigers and bears... Oh my. But there isn't. But it is full of @realDonaldTrump lies. The whole world is full of @realDonaldTrump lies.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz pic.twitter.com/j4eKRgXp2T
And now @realDonaldTrump just sent out a fundraising notice that he'll match EVERY DONATION, DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, which ANYONE with 1/8 of a brain knows is a LIE. He's OPENLY LYING TO HIS OWN SUPPORTERS.
That doesn't seem to agree with anything that @realDonaldTrump has said in the last few weeks. But I guess honesty is no longer a virtue that the right aspires to? Good job at selling yourself out.
Nationalist is not the same as White Nationalist. A nationalist (small "n") is someone who puts the interests of their country first. I am one. #Trump @realDonaldTrump #GOP #DontAcceptTheLiberalMediasNarrative

I hope and pray that @realDonaldTrump sent the CIA and FBI to infiltrate the migrant mob to find the sources of this attack on America!

I'll be shocked and disappointed if President Trump stops criticizing Dems. His criticisms are valid, and our nation cannot afford to let their scare tactics work. Criticize them all you want, @realDonaldTrump ! I support you!
You think the "bombs" were sent by a Corey Booker supporter? He is being stupid by trying to stoop to @realDonaldTrump 's level. He is not very good at it. Watch your boy at his "rally" and listen to his words. He will step in it again.
It is impossible to divorce @realDonaldTrump from the fact that Trump has targeted each of the Democrats targeted by bombs today. Donald Trump's rhetorical hateful words have preceded the actions that intended to kill Democrats. Trump is responsible for the scorched Earth attack!
We need you in Florida @realDonaldTrump for @RonDeSantisFL . Please help!

My prediction is that @realDonaldTrump will say the EXACT same type of anti-press, anti-Democratic inflammatory rhetoric at his rally tonight that he has at every rally. Nothing will change.
Tune in to @WBAY online at http:// WBAY.com now, where @realDonaldTrump is speaking live.

@FoxNews is as desperate as @realDonaldTrump
And they have a possible 210,000,000 more seconds until Jan 2025 of HATE TRUMP @potus @realDonaldTrump ahead of them. I truly feel sorry for them.
@realDonaldTrump Had any of those bombs killed people, their blood would have been on your hands. Normally I wouldn't attribute blame in that way, but you incite, incite, incite violence and hate at every opportunity, so this one is yours.
Replying to @realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker and @LeahVukmir . Save America. Vote red
@realDonaldTrump wonder where someone would get the idea to use violence against the opposition? Maybe because you praise those who do. #WordsMatter Trump praises Gianforte for body slamming reporter https:// youtu.be/QwiaCUUScqc via @YouTube
. @MSNBC . @cnn . @realDonaldTrump #trumps MO is reverse psychology. Trump & his base have the same mentality & same IQ. He spews out irrational ideas at his rallies. Trump doesn't know any facts, which is why his rallies don't have substance & his base doesn't know any better!
Vote @realDonaldTrump 's CORRUPT @GOP out of power!
Very busy day in America. @kroger had a mass shooting, pipe bombs were sent to @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @CNN @RepMaxineWaters . Is this the "winning" you spoke of @realDonaldTrump and @GOP ? #FUMAGA
@realDonaldTrump choose right words for a change would be great
So, @realDonaldTrump basically just told the country DO AS I SAY NOT AS I DO, eh? His slogan should have been "Got violence?" for f*ck sake
@axlrose @Slash @gunsnroses News footage from another Trump rally tngt had G&R'"November Rain"playing in the background pre-rally. As an avid 31yr G&R fan,I implore you to please restrict @realDonaldTrump from playing your awesome tunes at his hateful, ego stroking rallies. #basta

Chinese and Russian spies are listening in to President @realDonaldTrump 's iPhone calls: NYP reports
A real president would call up Hillary and the rest of the targets of these deadly bombs to offer support. A real president would cancel a partisan political rally and firmly condemn ALL violence. Instead, @realDonaldTrump has called NONE of the targets & will hold his rally.
This is not a both sides issue this is a @realDonaldTrump Fake 45, @GOP , and @FoxNews issue. They are the ones screaming like lunatics that @TheDemocrats are a mob they want to replace you with brown people. Scare tactics are the only thing they know because they can't beat us.
We get what we deserve. If we can't win the House back in November, and if we can't vote @realDonaldTrump out of office in 2020, then we deserve the douchebag.
@Scaramucci why don't u quit talking 4 @realDonaldTrump , you don't know what he means or doesn't mean.. your an idiot what is wrong with saying your a nationalist which means he advocates 4 political independence so just shut up & go away..
Trump called for unity because of the bombs sent to President Obama, Hillary Clinton and CNN. I laughed. A man who devotes most of his time to dividing the country wants us to come together as one. You're the problem @realDonaldTrump #ShitholePresident #Traitor #Fraud #Liar

@realDonaldTrump should have cancelled the rally; he knows the people he's whipped into a hate filled frenzy will be cheering these attempted murders.
Has anyone ever been to a @realDonaldTrump rally? I have and I can attest that the women there are some of the most gorgeous ones I have ever seen.
All the democrat politicians left their voters standing at the alter to go fight @realDonaldTrump in fear of losing their Washington gravy train
@CNN thankyou for covering this, but it's clear @realDonaldTrump promoted this terrorism and he is complicit in creating a militia who is committing acts of war on American soil. Trump has promoted terrorism, he failed to condemn it, and now it's happening. He caused it.
@realDonaldTrump no back to that Trojan Horse coming to our southern border!
@realDonaldTrump is the leader of a terrorist group. Inciting violence against his own country. TRAITOR

U need to talk to your boss @realDonaldTrump who incites violence at every rally
@realDonaldTrump Lack of leadership and humanity. Earlier he said we need to.unify the country, so much for that. Two faced liar.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for reaching across the aisle and condemning this, even though it was only targeted at Dems

The thing that would calm the political divide would be the media & the dems reassuring the public that the 2016 election was fairly won by @realDonaldTrump & stop all the conspiracies & lies about him. That is what spills over to all the rest of the resist nonsense & violence.
America is gradually becoming one big dumb down society, thanks to @realDonaldTrump #MAGABomber
My exact thoughts. I would put nothing past the evil dems, look at the underhanded rigged scene they tried to pull with Kavanaugh. They are THAT desperate! Speaking of, Ford disappeared just as quick as she came! #RedWaveRising2018 #DemocratsAreDangerous @realDonaldTrump

How does @FLOTUS feel about that? @realDonaldTrump must remember she is one!
If Kemp wins it's by blatant cheating. criminal charges should be filed as well as a lawsuit. here's your #voterfraud @realDonaldTrump . Many red states and red districts are actually perpetrating it. Including @KrisKobach1787
If Fake News' Fake polls have @realDonaldTrump at "47%", that means Trump's REAL approval rating is more like 67%-70% WINNING!
Not one bit. T and his entire administration are like an incendiary device. Honest Americans never know when T will inspire a wing-nut to take us all out. @realDonaldTrump

You, your party and Especially @realDonaldTrump fueled his hate! You lied, called democrat women names, mocked Clinton, Obama. Bashed the media and bullied. He praised violence at his hateful, inciteful kkk rallies! You people are a disgrace and a stain in American history!

Amazing @FoxNews moment Shep blames @realDonaldTrump and Chris Wallace calls him on it and Shep denies he said it. Shows how much hatred Shep has for DJT.
@nytimes Why aren't you running article after article about @realDonaldTrump 's phone. THIS IS A MAJOR STORY. REPORT ON IT LIKE YOU DID ON HILLARY'S EMAILS
I'm sure there'd be people saying that about @HillaryClinton if she had won in 2016. She isn't exactly great. @realDonaldTrump is WAY more worth the vote than Hillary "I told Bill Clinton's accuser to shut up " Clinton.

@realDonaldTrump only reason the media is to blame is they broadcast your pathetic rants & craziness. You want to see the culprit that started the fire look in the mirror ..
@realDonaldTrump President Trump , if you need more soldiers to go to the borders ,please call on our veterans. I am ready to serve my country again . thank you
No @realDonaldTrump is referring to himself.
Our #media must accept responsibility for its #BadReputation , which is not due to @realDonaldTrump but to the media's #scapegoatism & obnoxious, #disrespectful behavior. Like spoiled #brats , they whine & blame the President when THEY are at fault, starting w/ @CNN . pic.twitter.com/Eq77WRTVtU

Would like to hear you @RickSantorum stand up and say that the targets the bomber chose aren't common threaded by @realDonaldTrump rhetoric.
@realDonaldTrump you can't unify people if you can't admit your part in tearing the unity apart. You have to be a big enough man to admit that and YOUR NOT!
Yes, definitely. It's time. I'll go step further. @realDonaldTrump 's unfit to be President of the United States of America. Trump's blaming media again tonight at rally in NC. Still hasn't reached out to intended victims of #MAGAbomber . No concept of job of POTUS. Independent
Dear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump could you please come to Albuquerque for a rally. I will be in attendance if you do with my Trump hat on.
Islam doesn't radicalize people, individuals do. You can support Islam and not support the individuals that misinterpret it. @realDonaldTrump directly radicalizes people through his words and actions. You cannot support him and his power with the same absolution.
@realDonaldTrump STOP BEING A COWARD AND SISSY. WE ARE TIRED OF YOUR SHIT. YOU ARE ASKING FOR TROUBLE YOU FUCKIN BASTARD. SOMEONE NEEDS TO ACT AGAINST THIS HITLER. VOTE DEMOCRAT!!!

@realDonaldTrump No, media has no role to play with your vile and vicious rhetoric, it is all you so shut the hell up about the mainstream media. Go tell it to fake Fox News you damn whiner.
You know the theory that @realDonaldTrump is actually a genius politician because he has so many scandals and moments of incompetence that we lose focus on all of them? Seems like @MattForMontana , @GregForMontana , Corey Stapleton are trying it out in Montana this week. #mtpol
Te he he. I got #RealNews for them. They've been exposed & they's no turning back no matter how big the hissyfits they throw get. I'm betting @realDonaldTrump is just gonna keep calling em out for what the are. And he needs us to keep cheering him on for all we're worth. #Winning

"I think they're looking pretty good...But I'm here tonight because we can't take any chances," @realDonaldTrump says.
@SecretService may want to look at shutting down @realDonaldTrump rallies as it is pretty clear that domestic terrorists are now being radicalized there.
Then your lying when you said that you have been to a number of his rallies or you wear ear plugs. This one is no different and the people are loving @realDonaldTrump
@Twitter should take a stance on the violence @realDonaldTrump is inciting. His slanderous tweets directed at specific individuals should be treated as every other abusive tweet and his account should be CLOSED! Wake up, America- he is DANGEROUS and inciting VIOLENCE! #Vote

So we should put armed guards in every house of worship, every restaurant, every grocery store, every movie theater, every gas station. Everywhere? Does this #MAGA @realDonaldTrump ?
How dare @realDonaldTrump suggest we arm synagogues... and not to set a standard of moral behavior, get rid of guns, and to make a stand against anti Semitic and racist prople in his administrative swamp and in his base . He is just disgusting #UnfitForOffice
Do you all remember when @RonDeSantisFL and @realDonaldTrump were in heated words? Well I sure do. DeSantis realized that Trump was doing great for our country and decided to join the @The_Trump_Train This train is growing everyday.

. @realDonaldTrump you clearly understand nothing about mass killers, they commit these acts knowing, wanting to be killed in the effort. Threat of the death penalty doesn't deter crime, that's a fact. So to say threat of the death penalty would stop mass shootings is asinine
I'm sure this is the #iPhone that @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS uses to access @Twitter to send out his tweets and talk to people like family, friends and others, that's non-classified/top secret, however I'm sure for official business i.e. classified/top secret matters it is secured.
@realDonaldTrump Armed worshipers!? The root cause mr "president" isn't religion or weapons its #Hate and your unwitting promotion, and yes, weponization of it. Period!
@realDonaldTrump You are a shithead.

You can blame @realDonaldTrump for his "Globalist" dog whistling.
I already voted 100% GOP for #MAGA & @realdonaldtrump Our POTUS needs ever single GOP on the ballot
I know @realDonaldTrump could never have empathy, a heart or show compassion, care and love like President @BarackObama but instead of him going to that rally he should've been in Pittsburgh showing some kind of care & love for those who lost loved ones but that's just me.
I never voted for him what makes him think I want his version of democracy? Time to take money like his out of politics. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump - I am tired of having someone in the White House who doesn't care about making our country better. Why are you never outraged? It could have been your family ( if they ever really go to synagogue) This violence towards people who are different has got to stop!
. @realDonaldTrump No mercy for terrorists?? Oh good, then does that mean no mercy for Saudi scum and no mercy for your pals, the Zionists either?? Let's hope so !
and donnie will say he had more people at his me, me, me rally..won't you @realDonaldTrump #Magabomber
@realDonaldTrump NEVER said "Nazis" or Neo Nazis are 'fine people." Part of the Big Lie. In Charlottesville 2 groups protested originally - those who wanted statues to say & those who wanted them to be torn down. Trump said there were "good people on both sides." 2/3
Again, crooked @realDonaldTrump is an evil cloud that has to be dispersed! #TreeOfLifeSynagogue #GunControlNow #ImpeachTrumpNow #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
@realDonaldTrump Immigrant caravan - Would it be a good idea to confront and assist them BEFORE they get to the border. The liberal news media is foaming at the mouth to get their cameras on them right on our border. Is someone trying to get them here before election day?
Whatever, evil will happen with or without @realDonaldTrump .
The right likes to say Obama LIED when saying if you like you plan, you can keep it. MOST people did keep their plan and their doctor. What comes out of Trump's mouth everyday, are outright, provable lies. Today: Wall St. was open the day after 9/11. @realdonaldtRump #maga

White nationalism is a war against the modern, multicultural, democratic world. Very similar to the motivation of ISIS. And that's @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump I think you're doing a phenomenal job, President Trump, and am praying for the Republican party to have GREAT success in these upcoming Mid-term elections. Hope the democrats get DECIMATED!!! I'm from Toronto, Ontario.

It's thanks to the hateful rhetoric and lies which spew from your mouth & racist Pussygrabber ( @realDonaldTrump ) which are DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for this horror & the mailed bombs from the previous week. Perhaps you & your boss should reassess what the fuck you are saying!!!
@GOP @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump when will the Republican Party realize that the NRA is the enemy of the state.?
@realDonaldTrump Pt.5 My response. Once President Trump is apprised of this atrocity, he will take action against these alleged criminals!!!...and these are criminals!!!
Like they did for everything, I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow @realDonaldTrump and @FoxNews ( @IngrahamAngle , @marklevinshow , @TuckerCarlson @rushlimbaugh , @LouDobbs ... say that 11 dead in the mass shooting at Pittsburgh Synagogue was a hoax.

Yes, and @realDonaldTrump is radicalizing them by his twitter feed with all the hatred and lies he spews!
The message of @realdonaldtrump in his speeches is clear when he says that the nation must reunite he means that the Democrats must reunite with him & that the media must conform to the Fox news to the propaganda of the state is not a message of union but a threat to obey.
Miss his compassion. At best @realdonaldtrump grudgingly reads a teleprompter speech he neither believes nor cares about.
This is something @DonaldJTrumpJr pervert GF would come up with maybe she helped the #magabomber , while @LouDobbs watched and the called @realDonaldTrump to confirm everything is fake news

The only thing shameful is you. These proud young black Americans are thinking for themselves & turning away from you and your anti @realDonaldTrump rhetoric. Trump was good enough when you needed him or his $ but now you stand in judgement of him. God will judge U in the end.
The more the left hates @realDonaldTrump the more I know he is on track. I judge how much I like something he does by how much hate the left spews.

@realDonaldTrump Demoncrats use real bullets to murder innocents! Why do they hate Jews?
Liar. @realDonaldTrump NEVER called "immigrants" animals. He called MS-13 ANIMALS - would you like to speak to the parents of a young girl murdered by MS-13 & call then "divine sparks?" Soros may be Jewish but he's an ENEMY OF ISRAEL. He NEVER said "Nazis" are fine people 1/2
. @realDonaldTrump After the #SynagogueShooting you say antisemitism should be condemned. Mr. President, I condemn you and your supporters for demonizing George Soros, a Jewish Holocaust survivior who has used his wealth to benefit others.

@realDonaldTrump I agree with you- if we cower down and change our lives because we are afraid, we have let the evil ones and the Deep State win

Well perhaps @RealDonaldTrump will care when his inaction is tied to genocide. But everyone in #GOP answers to The church of Donald Trump and Latter Day Nationalists, so I would not be very hopeful.
@realDonaldTrump You claim to be a businessman, but facts "Anticipating market chaos, panic selling and a disastrous loss of value in the wake of the attacks, the NYSE and the Nasdaq remained closed UNTIL September 17, the longest shutdown since 1933." YOU LIED IN #Illinois #VOTE
So Hugh, your saying @realDonaldTrump 's support of white nationalists and vitriol about his political opponents and the media has no connection with inciting violent acts? Doesn't jibe with the history books.

Holy fuck it just occurred to me that @realDonaldTrump is watching The Purge movies on cable for Halloween season and is thinking these are amazing training films for his American Neo-Orange Youth (ANOY) movement.

@realDonaldTrump help Mexico now to build new Border town on their side.........this is an assault on our Country.....
Make others feel similarly to him??? I wonder....and @realDonaldTrump does this on the daily.
Nauseating how stupid @realDonaldTrump thinks most of us are, and that simply by pretending to be shocked and blameless we're all just going to magically forget moments like these. Words have consequences, and the blood of many good ppl is now on his hands. pic.twitter.com/LNpaiV6u6S
