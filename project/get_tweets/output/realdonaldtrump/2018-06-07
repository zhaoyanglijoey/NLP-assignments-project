I'm glad I had the foresight to mock you as President Dumbass, @potus @realdonaldtrump . Your "make shit up" strategy and totally willfull ignorance make me look like a genius of sarcasm. More and more people are saying you truly are the #CaptainOfTeamStupid .
We're all building bunkers in our backyards again. Is THIS what @realDonaldTrump meant about "making American great again?" Do we need to have nuclear drills in classrooms again? FFS.. WHY doesn't someone just say it? He is suffering from several mental issues, and dementia.
will yoo sends @realDonaldTrump to uranus
Mostly in democrat controlled Chiraq. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump CANADA HATES YOU! YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE! pic.twitter.com/fuC4guruGY
Comeback??? LOL We are in a downward spiral. Losing influence with allies, lost our world leadership, and the administration is an embarrassment! I didn't care for GW Bush, Carter, or LBJ but I would take any one of them back over @realDonaldTrump !
I always knew @mike_pence was @realDonaldTrump 's lap dog. @OutFrontCNN #OutFront

President something or someone keeps on undoing all of your retweets that I retweet & likes dated back to May 17th anything dated past that it's deleted & I have to retweet it & like it all over again, I just thought you should know that this is being done. pic.twitter.com/fJSAT2sfpv
let's be clear & HONEST @potus @REALdonaldtrump isn't preparing for the summit because he's too immature & uneducated to be able to understand the complexity of the issues
@SenSchumer has no business telling @realDonaldTrump about something the DEMs couldn't come close to doing.
@DWStweets #ImranAwan ... @POTUS @realDonaldTrump WHY HAS THE JUDGE... A OBAMA HOLD OVER NOT RECUSED HERSELF?? #JudgeTanyaChutkan PLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS. @DWStweets BROTHER IS THE ATTORNEY PROSECUTING/OVERSEEING CASE! https:// youtu.be/EswJiRHsEVI

@justinamash @RepThomasMassie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump 1/3 Lets get something straight. Coast guard disnt rescue 16k people in Texas. Why? because POTUS didn't authorize coast guard to use the boats. Only helo. i was one of those volunteers who drove 6 hour
This guy is a baffoon tried to come at @realDonaldTrump for his decision then proceeds to agree with Trumps decesion...what was the point you were trying to make?

. @realDonaldTrump lied to you today. He lied to you yesterday and he will lie to you tomorrow. His @PressSec will back up his lies with more lies. He maintains the full support of the @GOP . Voting matters.

@cnn is so confused because they accused @realDonaldTrump of being a racists yet he keeps helping the black community and its injustices
@realDonaldTrump please learn the facts before dishonestly tweeting about our country. Your citizens may not mind, but despite our stereotype niceness, we have a deep pride in our country and its honesty.
As a Canadian who supports @realDonaldTrump this entire dialogue is very interesting. #cdnpoli #maga
Do it on the street corner, hold a town hall in the community you play in, pay for a radio/tv spot or print add, hold a march down main street USA, get ESPN to do a segment - or all the above. @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump hey I got a parking ticket in Walnut Creek, CA. Really unjust and unAmerican. can I get a pardon?

@realDonaldTrump More confusion with your hurricane Harvey comment. People were rescuing others with their boats NOT just in boats to watch the hurricane..and 16,000 people? Where did you get your info? You need to back up your comments..and not just what fox says!

Plausible deniability? HRC taught her well. #NODEALS #LOCKTHEMALLUP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Imbecile @realDonaldTrump and he's going to make mince meat out of you. You do know KJU heard what Ghouliani said about him being on his knees begging for it? Maybe he'll detain you in one of his luxury jail cells. One can dream!!
@realDonaldTrump lol Greta ! I remember a few years ago how the riots were so bad, it's amazing how people hate capitalism
Lmfao I really can't believe @realDonaldTrump really said people were going to the ocean to watch the hurricane come....... and that CNN reporter said "his lack of basic understanding is troubling" lmaoooooo
@realDonaldTrump keep on kicking ass. #MAGA All day.

@realDonaldTrump says that the @uscoastguard saved 16,000 Texan's who were watching hurricane Harvey from boats. For whatever reason. This jackass says the craziest batshit things. What say you @texasgov Texan's/Louisianians/Americans were saving lives.

Obama laid the foundation. @realDonaldTrump and the Repubs are trying everything they can to screw it up. Then they will blame Obama.
Attacking Canada again on trade? Seriously, @realDonaldTrump ? We are your biggest trade partners. Starting this trade war with all of your allies while giving China breaks on ZTE? What's happening in the USA? Does anyone in the Party of Reagan care about the US Constitution? #sad
