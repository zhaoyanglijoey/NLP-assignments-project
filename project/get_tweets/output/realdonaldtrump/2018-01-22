@realDonaldTrump but you might have the misguided premise that you are putting America first by deporting true Honorable Americans with the added safety net that there would be 800 thousands plus now without the ability to challenge your corrupt agenda
. @realDonaldTrump has proven to be an unreliable negotiating partner, even going back on his word with members of his own party.
@realDonaldTrump Do you limbo. How low can you go.
You mean #Resist ? @realDonaldTrump #ReleaseTheMemo
Also first time I've heard any democrat talk about the opioid crisis. Looks like they are stealing parts of @realDonaldTrump agenda. Best way to stop drugs entering out country is build a wall @chuckschumer #SchumerSellout

Yesterday I said I was proud of my country because 3/4 of the country opposed @realDonaldTrump & his apostate hatred Gospel. Today I realize I was partially wrong. I am not just proud of my country. 3/4s of the WORLD protested that man the past two days.
@realDonaldTrump So, President Bannon was fired and has now been REPLACED with @StephenMillerAL Once again YOU have someone in your WH who seemingly has more power than you do He's playing you like a cheap violin & you look weak & stupid CONGRATS PRESIDENT MILLER you own @POTUS

Mr. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump the way bills go through the House and Senate need to change. Each bill should address ONE issue only. That way there would be no bickering when one party wants one issue one way and the other party wants another issue another way!
You know the march was PROTESTING @realDonaldTrump realand his sick agenda! You don't report news, you report what trumpty dumpty pays you to report.
@realDonaldTrump is a despicable little fuck faced, umpaloompa. He gave paramedics the right to refuse to treat someone that is LGBT.

Do you trust @realDonaldTrump ?
How long before we see @realDonaldTrump taking some sort of credit for ending the #trumpshutdown ?
There is no possible way @realDonaldTrump would support this. #DumpDACA

@realDonaldTrump Mr. Presiden END CHAIN AND LOTTERY MIGRATION. NO MORE UNDERAGE MIGRATION. Send them back home.FULL FUNDING FOR THE BORDER WALL, More Guards, More equipment, Better pay. NO MORE SANCTUARY CITIES. MERIT MIGRATION and require time limits to file for citizenship.
Memo was smokescreen to divert attention from #TrumpShutdown . Emails! Memo! Texts! All diversions from the incompetent governing of @realDonaldTrump and @GOP .
It has been shown that @spkerofthehouse @SenateMajLdr and definitely @realDonaldTrump cannot be trusted Would you want to be torn away from your family and the only country you've known There has to be a solution to #Dreamers and their families not deportation Good vote!

And this is who everybody wanted over @realDonaldTrump people that support imported gang members of #MS -13 to come rape our women & children. SMH at you #Dems

@realDonaldTrump We appreciate the sacrifices that you and your family are making to restore America to God. We know that a vocal few do not appreciate what you do; but what really matters is that you are doing what God wants you to do.
The best #immigration deal for the @TheDemocrats to accept is no deal at all. By not reaching a deal @realDonaldTrump doesn't get his wall, more funds for #BorderSecurity , and the elimination of #ChainMigration and the #VisaLottery .

Three weeks a fool. Republicants look to string out DACA to get @realDonaldTrump 's wall.
@realDonaldTrump has been exposed, and what's under the wig isn't a pretty sight.
Stephen Miller has the speech writing skills of an angry third grader and knows @realDonaldTrump struggles to read speeches out loud in public. The result is policy based on a limited vocabulary with no grounding in scientific research or critical thought.
