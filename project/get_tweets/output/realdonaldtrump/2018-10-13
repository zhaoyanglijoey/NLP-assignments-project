So are you "deeply troubled" about 10,000 Yemeni people that have been killed by Saudi Arabia or because millions of Yemeni children are starving to death? Have a feeling you found out @realDonaldTrump is going to replace you with @nikkihaley in 2020. ..if he isn't imprisoned

@realDonaldTrump that was awesome!loved the prayer the pastor had with you. You are a wonderful President! God is with you!
@realDonaldTrump says he's not a politician but actually, he is, because every day he pits Dem's and Rep's against each other. I have never seen a president that didn't stand for the Greater Good of the Country or caused such unrest and division between his American Countrymen!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS #BrasilComBolsonaro17
. @realDonaldTrump is the leader of the anti- #MeToo movement, which is appropriate since he's credibly accused of sexual assault and admitted he moves on women like a bitch before getting their permission on Access Hollywood tape. "I do not even wait, I just start kissing them."
Absolutely Take John Brennan Security Clearance stripped Omarosa Smoke & Mirrors Kavanaugh took weeks Smoke & Mirrors @realDonaldTrump it's so Dellusional Fake Presidenct to think all your Filthy Dirty Dealings were going to be Swept UNDER THE CARPET JUST LIKE UR TAX RETURNS

How do ppl justify supporting @realDonaldTrump ? Racist, sexist, against veterans, gay ppl, the poor...where is the good?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @VP pic.twitter.com/AwtXpTfFaT
I blocked and reported the Orange Hate Monkey @RealDonaldTrump months ago. I just reported him again for kicks since I've read recent tweets passed on by friends and I know he's still violating @Twitter rules pretty much daily if not hourly.
When @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @senatemajldr were rolling out the tax cuts, we were told that workers would receive a wage increase of 5K. I know of no one who received that increase & very few who received an increase at all. Trickle economics has never worked U r all liars.
@realDonaldTrump By your standards --- pic.twitter.com/569uaUKfAd
@realDonaldTrump this is my Brazilian president!
Actually... Parents will be inclined to send their kids in USA for FREE education. BECAUSE US would have to educate these kids for free. Even send them to college. @realDonaldTrump needs to allow the Army to get this kids for proper US education
@realDonaldTrump Just read about the coming Honduran invasion. Please get military to stop this. We USA citizens are sick and tired of taking care of those people who don't want to fight for their own country but want us to support them here in my country.
Doing away with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid coming to a theater near you.Thanks to the Rape of the Middle Class Tax Bill that @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr and the @GOP (Government of Putin) passed so the richest could remain the richest.Another con job by @realDonaldTrump
@NHDems ... are the 4th Reich! @realDonaldTrump @potus @ScottPresler @ACTBrigitte
@realDonaldTrump @VP @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan @GOP "GOP Kills Bill to Cover Pre-Existing Conditions Just 25 Days Before the Midterms" You smug, soulless, self-serving assholes! Millions of Americans will die because of you...not that you care. I pray the Blue Wave happens!
There should not be a reason for Republicans to worry if Democrats win in November they would impeach @realDonaldTrump . The Democrats are also Americans and deep in their conscience they realized the great achievements of this president and would not do any move against him..
No, @realDonaldTrump never works. He does lie, cheat and steal. To many that would be work. To #DonTheCon it comes easy
@realDonaldTrump
Sometimes you just wish Trump @realDonaldTrump would just shut up. He so embarrassing.

This is a lot of hot bullshit! That is NOT how this works! Saudi's can't sell their oil to Russia! We have FAR more power than @realDonaldTrump wants US to know. He has placed self interest above US interest! Get this piece of conflicted garbage OUT of the WH!
Yes Lord please bless and guard and guide this President and First Lady Melania too. Thank you Lord for putting him in place for America Lord. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS
Amazing. Best press conference. Never seen anything like it. @realDonaldTrump @wreckon95
@realDonaldTrump mr president. are you trying to read cue cards in your twitter profile pic. did your other self hold em up high enough for the other you taking the picture? we know you are the only person important to you.
What an awesome man that comes back from 2 years imprisoned and prays for @realDonaldTrump This November is the second most important election in my life We need to vote a straight Republican ticket
since @realDonaldTrump is president, there is no intellectual honesty left between the Republicans and the actual Democrat Party, hijacked by fringe socialist actors and far left anarquist movements.
Socialist, Progressives, Liberals, Democrats are just cover names for the Communist Party in America. Our survival as a nation depends on recognizing the Enemy for who they really are and what they really have planned. #MAGA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP https:// wp.me/paiUPd-mE
@ardeth_lewis @realDonaldTrump I blocked Trump, the White House and Melania last week. It has been cleansing.
@realDonaldTrump We need to build up a new laws to control descendants of Traditional political power.If they break the laws,they will be punished 3 times than normal citizens.[and money can not avoid the punishment].
Or maybe people just don't like @realDonaldTrump turning our beautiful Democracy into a tinpot Dictatorship and a world where Russia, North Korea and Saudi Arabia are the Good guys & maybe people don't like politicians who say a lot a pretty words but then do Nothing to stop it.

All it took was for @realDonaldTrump to look the other way while the Saudi's torture, murder and dismember a journalist. Let's not forget that he also makes money of the Saudi's.
@realDonaldTrump you are the best president of my generation, keep it up.
. @realDonaldTrump believes criminals Pete Brown and Adam Lichtenstein are more important and covering up conspiracies of abusing the Patriot Act and attempting to murder and murdering U.S. Citizens is what you're supposed to do as @POTUS because he's an IGNORANT FAT SLOB!

@realDonaldTrump Never ever had we had a Pres. So into criticizing the Dems and constantly promoting his own Rep party. Also having pep up rallies throughout the year just to boost his own ego and allow him to bad mouth his very own constituents. Sad #FBR #StopembarrasingAmerica

Perhaps you should have a chat with @realDonaldTrump . Of course, when he sees your tweet he'll probably just make you delete it.

@realDonaldTrump Dead bodies of 11 babies were discovered 10/12 in Detroit's Cantrell Funeral Home that was shut down 6 months ago! Police said 9 bodies were found in a cardboard box & the others in caskets all hidden in the ceiling & authorities attempting to contact families.
Who else do they have? Ocasio-Cortez would sure have some interestingly funny speeches, and can you imagine her in a debate with @realDonaldTrump ?
No blue ties on the campaign trails, please @realDonaldTrump . #red .
If Satan comes into the House of God & follows Godly principles,then who am I to judge him? Also,if he follows Godly principles,then is he still Satan? Principles matter and they can change a man @realDonaldTrump is a man. The principles he follows today redeem his past mistakes
It does seem to get lost in the daily stupidity that is this admin. It makes me have nightmares. Why can't we do something? @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I heard FOX say they are no longer showing your rallies on FOX because the number of people wanting to view you are too small & the American public is no longer interested. GO LOOK AT THE POLLS AT YOUR FALLING APPROVAL RATES. THE US PUBLIC HATES YOU!!
@realDonaldTrump Hillary should be looking thru bars NOT out on our streets if Jeff Sessions was not sitting on his duff drawing on our taxpayer wages these past 2 yrs. she would be there instead she is out campaigning with Eric Holder the only Atty General convicted by Congress

@realDonaldTrump Self-Serving Bias. The common human tendency to attribute one's successes to personal characteristics, and one's failures to factors beyond one's control. The reason people tend to personalize success is because it helps their self-esteem levels. #antidem

"The law regarding depreciation assumes that real estate values decline annually, although often property values actually increase." New York Times: Kushner likely paid almost no income taxes. Legal or not this is another example of the @realDonaldTrump swamp.
