@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President for ALL you do for AMERICA.. Thank you for all you do for this country pic.twitter.com/r0nb2U2jsb
Perhaps if @realDonaldTrump grew a backbone and gave news briefings like a real and normal president, reporters wouldn't have to yell questions. He is afraid to interview with anyone but Fox who he has in his back pocket. Remember in November!!!!!
Agreed! Time to be serious Maxime and talk to @realDonaldTrump as a equal partner! Stop the .50 cent backlash tariff on Heinz ketchup imports...
The MSNBC/Q Feud heats up! @MSNBC says Q is an NWO Deep State plot and a unicorn.

Today's Historic Trade Deal is a Huge WIN for @realDonaldTrump and America! ZERO Tariffs! Dow Surging! Globalist Naysayers Attacking @POTUS on Trade War Can Eat Crow. So Proud of Our #AmericaFirst President! #TheArtOfTheDeal So Much Winning! pic.twitter.com/EDxUmYrvjG
Bill Shine is the guy that got fired from Fox News for aiding and abetting sexual predators by lying for them. Him banning a female reporter for asking @POTUS @realDonaldTrump a legitimate question about a topic Trump himself tweeted about earlier is the epitome of hypocrisy.
Apparently @SecPompeo you have removed @realDonaldTrump from the...checking.....TRUMP administration. I will say this, as a compliment; you have a wonderful sense of humor. BTW, did you enjoy getting your rear kicked by Corker and Menendez? I did...and I bet others did as well.
And nobody is more GROSS than @realDonaldTrump ! #TrumpMustGo
Full steam ahead on getting #TaxCuts2 passed! Thank you, @SteveScalise and all who vote to get this done! #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
So. Apparently his "staff" is keeping @realDonaldTrump isolated from reality, anything other than Fox News. Because he gets upset when people disagree with him or his poll numbers go down. THIS is our President??? THIS is America? What the fuck?!??!
If you really stood for justice and liberty, you'd switch parties and support @realDonaldTrump . But you don't. And that's how I know you're just a liar

Please God would you please oh please #ImpeachTrumpAndPenceNow and vote no on every single piece of GOP-backed legislation until and unless they start checking and balancing @realDonaldTrump abuses of power!?!
Innocent people don't pull crap like this, @realDonaldTrump @GOP #Mueller #Rosenstein
Boko Haram Militants overrun a military base in Nigeria https:// youtu.be/U5Rh3w3GzzY via @YouTube @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
My kid needs 12 glue sticks for school?!?! Fuck you @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump
NO, we have had enough! This is ridiculous! You have a president who has broken so many laws and norms they cannot be counted, but what do you do?Carry his water! I hope and pray all of you will be held accountable, sent home & prosecuted for aiding @realDonaldTrump ! #USAForever !
Let me make sure I understand this. It's ok to crap in the streets & cross our borders illegally but shock and awe if you use a straw in California. These leftists are totally out of control and have gone off the deep end.. Sorry, but they have gone 2 far. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump ...this Tweet shows you are in good company, Sir. God bless.
The Democrats blue wave has turned into a SMURF with a hand up. @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump If @jayawallace supports a reporter @CNN screaming questions in a room where you were not taking questions, I would be fine if you never went on their @FoxNews station again. Free press doesn't mean harassment. Obama would only allow certain questions.

#RT @realDonaldTrump : Obviously the European Union, as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States, as represented by yours truly, love each other! pic.twitter.com/dxYro0Bo7W
@realDonaldTrump you stupid little man , you will never be the dictator you aspire to be. Your days are numbered.
#RT @realDonaldTrump : Thank you very much, working hard! pic.twitter.com/gjIQvnTkL3
President @realDonaldTrump in my opinion appointed BY GOD for the ENORMOUS task previous administrations left him. Keep lifting him & his family up in prayer America.
@realDonaldTrump Part of his job as potus is to keep in touch across all media to be fully informed of the world around him. Cutting all but faux news just shows the whole planet AGAIN what a spoilt little toddler he is!
. @realDonaldTrump - . @jack . @twitter Stop the #Censorship
@realDonaldTrump what about, voter registration cards with chips that communicate nationwide when voting only.
@realDonaldTrump wants a civil war in the US. He's been priming his cult following for it and continues to do so. When indictments against him are unsealed, or any attempts are made to remove him from office he will call upon his cult members to converge on DC - armed. #Impeach45
Mark, Why don't you spend some time trying to help build the highways around Asheville instead of attempting to obstruct the Mueller investigation and conspire to pass along confidential information surrounding the investigation to @realDonaldTrump ? Who do you serve?
Not so tough in 1:1 meetings, aren't we? Baby London Ballon @realDonaldTrump
Surely one would expect that @realDonaldTrump would rebuke @repmarkmeadows and @jim_jordan for attacking Deputy Attorney General...
The only thing you stand for @NancyPelosi is being a Swamp Rat in the cover up of #Spying on @realDonaldTrump
How about we #JailEveryone and let @realDonaldTrump release people one by one?
Exactly. Presidential candidates should be vetted like they used to be also back in the day. Because the slime bag in chief @realDonaldTrump would have never made it out of Iowa or Massachusetts
Anyone tired of winning yet? I am not! @realDonaldTrump is showing how the last 4 Presidents were appeasers putting the American citizens last! Finally a real leader! God Bless America and President Trump!
Our trade policy....... @realDonaldTrump wins, everyboy else loses.
@realDonaldTrump Plastic straws are plastic ,thought plastic was recyclable
The French living under the Vichy collaborators and the Norwegians with Quisling would recognize the sad character of the likes of @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan , @replouiegohmert , @realDonaldTrump ,as they try to sabotage the investigation into an attack on our country by Russia.
Jesus! Don't just listen to what @realDonaldTrump was saying. Listen to how he was saying it!!!! Like Capone, he'll probably die in jail of an STD. fuckfacevonclownstick
Well martha I have to you the last few years the unprofessionalism and bias has many of us fed up. So not gonna lose any sleep over it. Long as the media has many other ways of getting the info the Republic will survive @realDonaldTrump good job @PressSec #MAGA
It's past time ! He should have like Jeff recused himself ! After being in on illegally tapping @realDonaldTrump campaign with the FAKE dossier !
For the sake of balance, let me extend gratitude to @realDonaldTrump for putting his ideology on hold and working with EU to suspend new tariffs and hopefully head off a devastating trade war. This will save American jobs and benefit economies on both sides of the Atlantic.

TOO Bad NOTHING is going to happen - Corrupt DEEP STATE Mafia, includes the farces in Congress, will cover up each other's crimes. @KimDotcom @JulianAssange @Snowden EXPOSE THE TRUTH - The People deserve the TRUTH @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity
Keep it up, #Liberals . This #LiberalViolence is why @realDonaldTrump was elected, and why he'll win another term.
@realDonaldTrump It is high time to fire Sessions and give America an EFFECTIVE and NON-IMPOTENT attorney general!

If you don't approve of the job @realDonaldTrump is doing, then you must be a liberal. Liberals are haters. Don't be a liberal.

I wonder if juuuuuuust for a second, @JudgeJeanine feared @realDonaldTrump was going to pinch her @$$?
We literally don't care what brings him down at this point. He just needs to go. The #CohenTapes are part of a much broader investigation into his criminal activity. @realDonaldTrump is involved in much worse things than paying off mistresses & breaking campaign finance laws.

@realDonaldTrump How are you doing reuniting children with their families? Tick-tock! Crime against humanity shame on u #Putinpuppet
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump You did the RIGHT thing. the only people crying about the CNN reporter being banned are reporters, Nobody feels sympathy for the media; they did this to themselves. Media does not have a RIGHT to be beligerant and not expect push back.

This is so low and below the pale. @realDonaldTrump has lied continuously and somehow you want to cover up for him. Is Russia paying you off too?
I've had it, and I think most of the country has had it. If Congress is too weak to start impeachment for @realDonaldTrump , then we need to replace them, with people that will. #TreasonSummit #TrumpRussia #TrumpIsANazi
You still have a job @megynkelly ? You should worry about yourself haven't you learned trying to take down @realDonaldTrump doesn't work well for you.
@freedomcaucus @GOP @SpeakerRyan @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It appears that since Paul Ryan is leaving, he wants Republicans to lose in Nov. It is. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AGENDA THAT IS WINNING! I guarantee if any of the GOP run on "The Better Way" agenda, THEY WILL LOSE!
@NewsHour You do more harm to yourselves than you do to @realDonaldTrump by not being honest with the American ppl! Shame on you! SHAME SHAME SHAME! Women in the Farm belt and that work for a living, love Trump! Accept it and start reporting real news!if possible

@realDonaldTrump You are a huckster, not a @POTUS . That is the only thing you can do.
This cannot be true! @realDonaldTrump is fearless. Biden cannot keep his hands, eyes, lips and pocket snake off of children.
You know Obama pushed that GET UP IN THEIR FACE stuff and WE soundly beat your stupid candidate Hillary last Election. WE ARE AMERICANS and we don't like people in our face like some 3rd World Country. I will work and DONATE even Harder for @realDonaldTrump than I did in 2016
@SenBobCorker I'm delighted your time in congress is through. You really failed to uphold justice and liberty. You're an embarrassment to the real free men and women of this country. Truly such a despicable performance today, your cheap shots were shameful. @realDonaldTrump
