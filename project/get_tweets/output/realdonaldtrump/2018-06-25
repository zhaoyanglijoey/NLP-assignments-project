@realDonaldTrump And the man God chose was neither a politician nor a priest. Instead, God chose a builder whose name was Nehemiah. And the first step of rebuilding the nation was the building of a great wall. God instructed Nehemiah to build a wall around Jerusalem to protect
Au contraire mon frere, our opposition to @realDonaldTrump and hatred of his policies are well grounded in reason. I'm sorry he bullied you in the primaries, but if you choose to stop kissing the Bully's posterior and reclaim your manhood the #Resistance will help you.

@realDonaldTrump Geez, you sound like a whiny, middle school Mean Girl. "Boohooo, you were mean to my friends, you were mean to me, so I'm going say mean things about you!!! Wahhhh!" So, Mr. Tangerine Man, who's running the country while you're being bitchy? Oh, right, Putin!
@realDonaldTrump Anticipating watching another great speech. Thank you for sending Maxine Waters a Tweet defending your supporters. LIBERALS ARE GETTING REALLY BAD. I hope people vote her out.
@realDonaldTrump How about you testify if you are so hot on transparency?
@realDonaldTrump When you have hecklers at your rallies, you should bring them up so they can give their opinion. Libtards probably have no idea what to say! #MAGA #Trump2020
An article @FiveThirtyEight suggests that 9 out of 10 republicans support Trump. @realDonaldTrump . Yes, that Donald Trump. 9 out of 10.
Robin, I don't think Hillary violated any health codes nor government ethics rules, unlike @realDonaldTrump and @PressSec Also @KellyannePolls

Someone needs to remind Senator Schumer that the First Amendment applies to all Americans. Besides @realDonaldTrump sets the gold standard for harassing political opponents.
The fact that @RepMaxineWaters and @realDonaldTrump are attacking each other with no class shows the dire state of our political climate. People cant disagree anymore without vitriol. Without hate. Be a mench.
@jeffsessions @SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @dbongino @AGPamBondi @FBI @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNewsInsider @RepMaxineWaters MAD MAX has gone off the rails....DO SOMETHING! This is SICK!
HAHAHA!!! Thanks @realDonaldTrump ! Way to support US workers by driving business overseas!!!
@realDonaldTrump I hope your plane crashes you delusional racist taint stain. (fingers crossed).
Hey @realDonaldTrump " I'm like a cool social media political advisor.
@realDonaldTrump the only way the restaurant denying service to Sarah & her family would be the same as the Christian bakers refusing to make a cake for a gay wedding would be if @PressSec asked the Red Hen to cater a political party and they said no, then she took them to court
@realDonaldTrump please make sure @PressSec and family have secret service protection. The People love her and she should not have to put up with what she is going through.

What is taking you so long to come on stage? @realDonaldTrump
Why, so I can hear you disrespect @realDonaldTrump . No thanks
Why is @realdonaldtrump tweeting insults about immigrants and Democrats instead of touting his "accomplishments"? One reason might be the fact that a whopping 4% of American workers are deriving any benefit from the gross Republican tax giveaway to corporations and billionaires.
