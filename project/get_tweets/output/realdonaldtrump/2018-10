@realDonaldTrump nice job remembering the Las Vegas massacre today too
Cowards don't fight, they get others to do it for them or they do it by insidious means. I could cough that cowardly @realDonaldTrump down and I am only 4'10.5" tall, weigh 7st and I am a 'girly'!!!! How embarrassing for him. One of these and he would be down
He's Lying!!! @PhilosophySeel Desperation like @realDonaldTrump ! It's called she's ignoring you because you don't matter!!!!
Bernie why should we care about America anymore if it is about to become a terrible place again with @realDonaldTrump selling us out to every short of the liquor lobby? What is going to be left that is good? We are never going to face the issue with people like this leading them
All the con man @realDonaldTrump did was change the acronym (Somebody tell him what that means) because he feels so inferior to our best president ever @POTUS44

@ABCWorldNews Just despicable to see the president disrespect @CeciliaVega at the press conference today. What a rude SOB @realDonaldTrump is. No class whatsoever. Pathetic.
Once again the Trumps celebrate the end of a drama cycle totally of their own making. So we have a slightly altered NAFTA that only includes provisions that would have been introduced with TPP and @realDonaldTrump celebrates it as a success. All he did was create chaos.

In deep-red Tennessee, @realDonaldTrump tells his ardent supporters that Democrats will "flood your streets with criminal aliens," echoing the fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric that fueled his victory in 2016. But will it help the @GOP defend the House in November?
@realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley demand the FBI get a copy of Dr. Ford's high school yearbook and that they talk her boyfriend who said she stalked him and also look into her current billion dollar pharma employer
I stand with you @CeciliaVega . Stand up to that bullying slob @realDonaldTrump
So you think using taxpayer dollars to help one party over the other is a Constitutional use of taxpayer dollars? Because it's not. The government isn't allowed to play favorites, though @realDonaldTrump doesn't seem to understand that ... and a great many other things.

The most important takeaway from the Times story is Trumps bilked the federal government in two ways: by raking in federal housing subsidies on questionable grounds, and then defrauding the government of tax revenue using every trick in the book. @realDonaldTrump @BobSMueller pic.twitter.com/k5Zp3mgyvl
Hey @realDonaldTrump Would U happen to remember when you took out a full page ad calling for the execution of THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE who had already been exonerated? Police already had a confession from the real rapist. Where was your worry abt innocent young men then? #BLACK
Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his tax returns.
#DebateFlorida No matter which candidate you support, it was interesting to watch both @FLGovScott & @SenBillNelson give closing statements in Spanish. Bet @realDonaldTrump & @RonDeSantisFL won't be doing that.

@PressSed is a serial liar. She never tells the truth. Just like @realDonaldTrump and #Kavanaugh .
@realDonaldTrump Instead of having people connected to congress for Atty General Job, you can replace Rosenstein & Sessions with these two without a doubt, 1st select Jeanne Pirro & then select Kavanaugh (if not confirmed) who both will bring down the Deep State via Prosecutions!
@realDonaldTrump is just like his father, a fraud and a cheat. Don't forget his grandfather was the same way. He made his fortune from brothels. All this vileness runs in his family. Who cares how much the trumps cover themselves in gold, they're still vulgar, dirty, vermin.

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President. You are likely to receive a statement from the Dems. After the midterm election. WE WERE WRONG ABOUT THE MOTIVES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. And it is obvious by the election results. The American People believed we were wrong also.
Mr. President, be humble & show a little grace. Act presidential, Mr. President. Fix our government & stop destroying it. Stop destroying Obamacare & fix health care. Stop pandering to morons. Do some things because it is right. Lead & prove everybody wrong. @RealDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump is a vile human being. No respect for women or victims of sexual assault. He is the embodiment of rape culture. This makes me sick.
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr President - you said the FBI isn't being limited but they can't talk to the plaintiff or the defendant who's your SCUS nominee? What kind of con-job are you trying to pull here? If you say Kavanaugh is innocent let the @FBI do their job. #Kavanaugh #trump
@realDonaldTrump you do not have the right to decide what alerts I get on the cell phone I bought and the monthly bill I pay for. This is government over reach and an invasion of my privacy! I am publicly demanding you cease and desist!

Someone should tell Trump and his "folks" victims of trauma often block out random details about the trauma, a psychological defense that is automatic, while remembering the specifics of the trauma itself. @realDonaldTrump @cnnbrk @PressSec @AC360 @donlemon @krassenstein

Somewhere, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, there are sightless creatures who have never known sunlight, that have greater character than @realDonaldTrump and his collection of goons and vipers.
Not because of who you are Mr. Bongino, but because they would extend the same courtesy to every person. This is why the backbone of OUR United States backs @realDonaldTrump ... in turn, he backs us, the little guys. Thank you for sharing this story!

If there is any justice in this world, @realDonaldTrump presidency will not just be the worst thing that happened to us, but the worst thing that happened to him.
In my lifetime, I never thought I would ever see parents bring their young children to a rally to be taught "How to be a BULLY"...by the president, @realDonaldTrump of the United States of America. We are living in the Twilight Zone.
@realDonaldTrump at the age of around two, with medical proof from Lander Wyoming, I took a fall '62 or '63, I was born in '60 I was destined to be a Retard, it runs in the Family But how that fall occurred? Son, it was set up I know They never expect that Boy to be so agile
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity AS AMERICAN CITIZEN I REQUEST SHARPTON & ALL CONGRESS BE INVESTIGATED BY FBI, DOJ & IRS 4 "NOT FOR PROFIT ORG" & TAXES NOT PAID BY CONGRESS WHO & HOW MUCH 4 BEING PAID BY LOBBYIST, KILLARY. SOROS, DEMA-RATS & OTHERS HAVE FBI FOLLOW THEIR MILLIONS
Well, turns out @realDonaldTrump is as much an illegitimate business man as he is an illegitimate president. A fraud and loser all the way. Always has been. No surprise that the only deal he could do so far was already negotiated by his predecessor. SAD!

Welcome Mr. President @realDonaldTrump
God knows there are better conservative options for SCOTUS, that's my only point. My concern is that @realDonaldTrump wants #Kavanaugh as SCOTUS for #RussianCollusion self-interest.
What about the country. This guy is a partisan hack sworn in to protect @realDonaldTrump at all costs. Also will be protecting the rotten GOP. I hope he gets his ass impeached. What a piece of shit. I feel sorry for his complicit wife and daughters.
Hey U.K., answer 1 question: WHY were you begging @realDonaldTrump NOT to Declassify the FISA Docs? WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES DEMAND TRUTH & OUR DULY ELECTED @POTUS WILL GIVE THAT TRUTH TO HIS PEOPLE ! WE see you & your corruption! We are cleaning up the Cabal WW! #QAnon

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President (Don't get yourself in any trouble) But wouldn't it be great, to get the word to the people. If any Democrat Senator votes against Judge Kavanaugh and is up for re-election in November, the people will vote them out of their seat.

No matter how much success the country has, as long as @realDonaldTrump is your president, you will never be happy. So therefore, I will never listen to you.
Now Sen. Lisa Murkowski is blaming the White House & @realDonaldTrump for what happened to Judge Kavanaugh. She is spinning it to look good. Your democratic friends laughed this attack for the only reason to make the President look bad and score political points
By attacking the motives of women who accuse men of sexual predation, @GOP and @realDonaldTrump give license to such attacks and a defense to the perpatrators. By their own actions they make sexual assault and violence against women acceptable behavior.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS you will go down in history as the first fascist US president. you may also go down in history as the LAST US PRESIDENT. will dance on your grave, fascist.
@realDonaldTrump You are the worst person of today. I wish you would get impeached, you hypocritical, racist, lying piece of shit. You are a disgusting pig. A fraud. A fool. And you deserve hell for all your crimes. Your retarded administration and you can go to hell.
Remember, @realDonaldTrump is under federal/state investigations for Obstruction of Justice, Conspiracy Against the United States, election tampering, RICO crimes, tax evasion/fraud, international humanitarian crimes, and hopefully Treason. Mueller is coming for you, Trumps.

This is leadership. Because of @realDonaldTrump , America is BACK!
Watch how many conservative cases to restrict or repeal rights now get pushed up to the Supreme Court. This is why the @GOP sucked at @realDonaldTrump 's teat and debased their own party's legacy. Morals and ethics mean nothing when their regressive agenda is at stake.
What a great day to be an American, a Republican, and a Conservative. Congratulations to Justice Kavanaugh, a very brave and good man. Thank you @realDonaldTrump , the best President we have had in my 63 years. Winning is bliss! Now we must VOTE next month. #KavanaughConfirmed

I love how the Dems are so up and arms about @realDonaldTrump mocking Christine Blasey Ford (which I happen to not agree with) meanwhile 2 minutes ago the Dems did a 13 minute skit on SNL mocking Kavanaugh for getting emotional about his life being ruined by false accusations.

I find it very sad that even if Melania or Ivanna Trump were in Ms. Ford's place and raped by Brett Kavannaugh, that @realDonaldTrump would still swear that rapist in. It just shows everyone in our country how much Trump cares about women.
Wait until the elections and the next protest, which will make the last Women's March look like a church picnic: @realDonaldTrump

Problem is we are teaching our kids to hate themselves and their country in school, that needs to stop if we ever expect to fix America @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump how come the US allowed government funded businesses to become privatized like the USPS, continue to get tax funding, but when the owner sells like fienstiens husband the money is not dissperesed back into the Us economy. like helping schools, fixing roads,etc.

Wow, you've got a thing for rape. @BillClinton had issues with sexual behavior just like @BretKavarnaugh , @realDonaldTrump , etc, the difference is while the rest of the world is trying to make up for how we handled sexual assault, the @GOP is embracing it as their platform.
@realDonaldTrump is POTUS. He speaks for the country whether or not you like it or agree. #Kavenaugh is on the bench. #getoverit

Apparently, @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr and basically the whole GOP thinks they can convince others that half of American citizens are a "mob", because we don't agree with their attacks on civil rights. So tonight, I am going to post a few things just from the FIRST year.
YOU do NOT apologize in my name to Kavanaugh. You had a chance to clear his name of sexual assault charges but chose NOT to interview the victims. AFRAID to find out the truth of course. HOW DARE you call it a HOAX!! You, sir, are a vile liar. @realDonaldTrump
People actually believe @realDonaldTrump gives money to #Vets ??? All he does is belittle #POWs , #Active and #MilitaryRetirees ! Lol, omg, @GOP is gullible! #BiasConfirmationNews

@realDonaldTrump You speak only for Deplorables & you should only speak for Deplorables. #BrettKavanaugh is a sexual predator. He's an even worse disgrace than #ClarenceThomas .
He is a neocon and enemy of @realDonaldTrump . He has been trying to undermine him since day one.
@realDonaldTrump -- Kavanaugh wasn't proven innocent -- he got away with it -- now you sexual assaulters can compare notes on how to mistreat women ...
@realDonaldTrump you dont speak for me.
The one issue with this notion is that @realDonaldTrump can only survive if he brings everyone down a few notches to his level and/or divides and conquers. The man has zero consensus building skills and lacks an understanding of the larger global community.
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @SenMajLdr @BrettKavanaugh How date U 3 call American people protesting in civil manner, which Every American Citizen has a right 2 do, a mob. The real mob has been the Repubs who have decided 2 shove a alleged attempted rapist down the throat

@joanwalsh Is there anything that @realDonaldTrump can do to have you say something nice about him or what he does? I'm sure you noticed that Associate Justice Kavanuagh had his family and friends with him the entire way. Dr. Fraud was by herself, no family or friends by her side

The entire GOP Congress now has assumed psycho attributions in that they are PROJECTING everything they are doing on to the democrats--following der leader @realDonaldTrump WHOSE SERIOUS ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER results in his constant combo of grievance/projection rants.
The angry mob was seen in Charlottesville carrying torches and is responsible for the death of one innocent woman. The very same people who @realDonaldTrump said are very fine people.
@realDonaldTrump DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR me nor for the millions of other Americans who know Kavanaugh has no BUSINESS being on the supreme court!

@realDonaldTrump Don't apologize to Brett Kavanaugh on my behalf, cuz i ain't saying it!!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe he is not going to fire him bc our President knows he, Rod, is going down for the political coup that is going on now and we know he is a big part of it. Firing him is not as dramatic as him being brought out in handcuffs.

@realDonaldTrump With cousins like yours, who needs enemies? Next time look in the basement for documents forgotten and un-shredded!
Yeah.... and what is even more scary is she is a teacher....this is what's indoctrinating your kids in government schools with taxpayers dollars. Think about that. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you have no right to apologize to Kavanaugh on the nations behalf ... I do not apologize at all for what he & his family have gone through

@nikkihaley @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse and the rumors start and propaganda will spin out of control @PressSec
In a tweet, "this is war, time to fight". And in the video in the original tweet, @realDonaldTrump says it's time to defeat the democrats for good. He and his supporters are getting the Republicans ready for war against Americans
Obviously @realDonaldTrump was curious also because he just led a cheer calling out each state, and the Nebraska cheer was FAR louder than Iowa's.
Since the 'win' of the confirmation, "Republicans fight back now. @realDonaldTrump has changed the Republican Party significantly for the better. Democrats should be terrified" this was @XStrategiesDC tweet from earlier today. Also @DonaldJTrumpJr said
I love listening to President @realDonaldTrump There's always something new and brilliantly funny each rally. And some good things the same... #BuildTheWall #USA #LockHerUp "Her" is now encouraging violence. We should change too... #HangHerUp ( #HangHerUpUntilSHEDead )

@realDonaldTrump is outrageous, Ivanka is qualified to sell clothing and shoes not represent America at the UN.
Set aside the electoral malfeasance (foreign and domestic): What rapprochement could be reached with #Cult45 whose judgement found @realDonaldTrump fit to become #POTUS ?
The biggest applause of the night -- by far at @realDonaldTrump rally -- is when the president mentions "Nebraska." The dangers of any Council Bluffs rally. "I just want to see who the hell I'm speaking to!" Trump said.

McConnell @senatemajldr called the protesters a mob, trump @realDonaldTrump claimed many were paid agitators. Maybe both should read the First Amendment. "; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

THEY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH @realDonaldTrump ! He's running circles around every.fucking.body.
This is the actions of a scared @GOP that when Trump @realDonaldTrump attacks the press something will happen to you.
So, the #OED actually has a picture of @IvankaTrump in her official #WH capacity in its definition of #Nepotism . Only @realDonaldTrump has the chutzpah (which is Yiddish for "disconnected to reality") to act like it would be a purely personal attack on him to call this nepotism.
You, #BrettKavanaugh , were NOT PRIVEN innocent and for @realDonaldTrump to utter those words is an outright lie...although, what else should we expect from #trump and this administration? Certainly not ethical behavior.
They showed a pattern of behavior. Supposed journalist willingness to let nothing stand in the way of attacking @realDonaldTrump and everything he does.

@realDonaldTrump is a small, petty man. Some day soon more of his supporters will figure that out. maybe will be when they find out how much he's taken from them; maybe when they realize he chose a rally over a hurricane of epic power in FL; maybe it will be the $500M he stole.

@Swerdlick Something to perhaps consider when discussing the relative significance of job growth numbers is that the closer a national economy inches towards full employment, the harder won growth is. Also, I bet the burgeoning gig economy helps @realDonaldTrump 's numbers.

@realDonaldTrump @PressSec There is a network that shows all the crowd at the president's rallies. Right Side Broadcasting is doing a great job and routinely shows the entire crowd. They are small and could use a shout out from the Pres.

When @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @senatemajldr were rolling out the tax cuts, we were told that workers would receive a wage increase of 5K. I know of no one who received that increase & very few who received an increase at all. Trickle economics has never worked U r all liars.
@realDonaldTrump By your standards --- pic.twitter.com/569uaUKfAd
@realDonaldTrump this is my Brazilian president!
Actually... Parents will be inclined to send their kids in USA for FREE education. BECAUSE US would have to educate these kids for free. Even send them to college. @realDonaldTrump needs to allow the Army to get this kids for proper US education
@realDonaldTrump Just read about the coming Honduran invasion. Please get military to stop this. We USA citizens are sick and tired of taking care of those people who don't want to fight for their own country but want us to support them here in my country.
Doing away with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid coming to a theater near you.Thanks to the Rape of the Middle Class Tax Bill that @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr and the @GOP (Government of Putin) passed so the richest could remain the richest.Another con job by @realDonaldTrump
@NHDems ... are the 4th Reich! @realDonaldTrump @potus @ScottPresler @ACTBrigitte
@realDonaldTrump @VP @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan @GOP "GOP Kills Bill to Cover Pre-Existing Conditions Just 25 Days Before the Midterms" You smug, soulless, self-serving assholes! Millions of Americans will die because of you...not that you care. I pray the Blue Wave happens!
There should not be a reason for Republicans to worry if Democrats win in November they would impeach @realDonaldTrump . The Democrats are also Americans and deep in their conscience they realized the great achievements of this president and would not do any move against him..
No, @realDonaldTrump never works. He does lie, cheat and steal. To many that would be work. To #DonTheCon it comes easy
@realDonaldTrump
Sometimes you just wish Trump @realDonaldTrump would just shut up. He so embarrassing.

@realDonaldTrump mr president. are you trying to read cue cards in your twitter profile pic. did your other self hold em up high enough for the other you taking the picture? we know you are the only person important to you.
What an awesome man that comes back from 2 years imprisoned and prays for @realDonaldTrump This November is the second most important election in my life We need to vote a straight Republican ticket
since @realDonaldTrump is president, there is no intellectual honesty left between the Republicans and the actual Democrat Party, hijacked by fringe socialist actors and far left anarquist movements.
Socialist, Progressives, Liberals, Democrats are just cover names for the Communist Party in America. Our survival as a nation depends on recognizing the Enemy for who they really are and what they really have planned. #MAGA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP https:// wp.me/paiUPd-mE
@ardeth_lewis @realDonaldTrump I blocked Trump, the White House and Melania last week. It has been cleansing.
@realDonaldTrump We need to build up a new laws to control descendants of Traditional political power.If they break the laws,they will be punished 3 times than normal citizens.[and money can not avoid the punishment].
Or maybe people just don't like @realDonaldTrump turning our beautiful Democracy into a tinpot Dictatorship and a world where Russia, North Korea and Saudi Arabia are the Good guys & maybe people don't like politicians who say a lot a pretty words but then do Nothing to stop it.

Waiting to see if Stahl of 60 minutes gives @realDonaldTrump kudos for the economy in second half. No bias there! #FakeNews
@realDonaldTrump go fuck yourself, traitor. #60Minutes
@realDonaldTrump is so very, very arrogant
@realDonaldTrump Baby.

@LesleyRStahl What a disrespectful interview with @realDonaldTrump on @60Minutes . Imagine if reporters took the same tone with @BarackObama . You conducted an interrogation, not an interview. This is shameful and irresponsible bias.
I love what @realDonaldTrump is doing. Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, de regulation, tax cuts, all are real change that build a stronger country. Obungler was a joke, a poseur, who damaged the country.
Did Lesley Stahl ever grilled @BarackObama like she's doing to @realDonaldTrump ? Yeah I didn't think so either. #DoubleStandards #60Mins
EXCELLENT @60Minutes interview right now with @realDonaldTrump . #60Minutes

@realDonaldTrump @60_minutesonCBS This interviewer Lesley Stahl is combative, argumentative, presumptive. The President has a lot of patience in the midst of her extremely judgmental tone. Watching is very stressful instead of informative. Is she auditioning for a play? MAGA
Today marks the 19th hostage President Trump has released while in office. THIS PRESIDENT has done it without bribes, plane loads of cash or sanction relief. He did it LIKE A BOSS.

@realDonaldTrump watching you get interviewed on 60 mins is hilarious. You are so stupid lmao.

"So when I won the election. . ." says @realDonaldTrump on "60 Minutes" Only a guy who knows he lost would have to keep talking this much about how he "won." #60Minutes #TrumpRussia
@60Minutes Lesley Stahl's questioning is ridiculous. @realDonaldTrump is running circles around her
Is it me, or is Leslie Stahl of #60minutes just rude to @realDonaldTrump ? Talk about having an agenda.
@60Minutes , @realDonaldTrump ; LESLIE STAHL was profoundly NEGLIGENT in preparing for the KIND OF QUESTIONS she commanded Trump answer.I DEMAND CBS+Stahl read Toffler "Power Shift"1990; REVIEW anti-compet TRADE restrictions "PURITY+SOURCE ORIG" LAWS&Anti GMO. Toffler battle Intel
Watching the 60 Minutes interview with @realDonaldTrump and I'm am disgusted with Lesley Stahl and CBS. Totally biased and disrespectful.
@LesleyRStahl @CBS I am extremely disappointed to see that you create your spin of the conversation after the camera is off of the President to fit your negative narrative on 60 minutes. Fake News is real and you are adding to it! Shameful and disgusting!! @realDonaldTrump
Have you ever seen a sitting US President treated so disrespectfully during an interview on @60Minutes , or any other program? @realDonaldTrump shouldn't give them the ratings bump. @LesleyRStahl is a hack. #60Minutes

Thanks Joe but if you want even more racism got @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls or Donald Trump Jr. Then tune into his rally tonight
Gee, I wonder how he might have figured it out? Looked at history? Actually @stevenmnuchin1 knew it beforehand and just lied because @realDonaldTrump told him to.

@realDonaldTrump you said that you'd pay a million dollars to charity of Senator Warren did a DNA test and prove she was Native American. Now you're trying to back away from your own words. Odd coming from the same guy who sued Bill Maher for questioning your own DNA...

@realDonaldTrump you are dancing on the graves of the 911 victims and our brave veterans. Saudi Arabia is a rogue terrorist country. They gave us 911, yet our President is blatantly lying to us on their behalf.
I don't know why he would trust them. CBS is FAKE NEWS and only wants to destroy him. They don't deserve a interview from our @realDonaldTrump .

He should be ashamed. The appointment was a political one and the "investigation" was a @realDonaldTrump sham. His people got to set the rules that is why Trump had no prob with it. Watch the Saudi investigation. Bet it was a "rogue actor" that murdered the reporter. More sham

Until I'm proven otherwise the ONLY reason I can see for supporting lying draft dodging corrupt morally bankrupt racist @RealDonaldTrump is because he brings out the white pride in you or your IQ is struggling to reach double digits. #MAGA #RacistParty

@realDonaldTrump you tiny f'n despot. Historically, demonizing ones enemies, "dem's are evil", "dem's want ms-13", makes it easier to get the publics support for extreme measures. This is America bitch and we aren't going to tolerate it.
Imagine the laughs @realDonaldTrump 's friends will have when he pretends he's Khashoggi with his fingers and parts of his arms cut off!
So they admit it, now where is the body? Taking a month to figure it out? Not buying it and neither should @realDonaldTrump just because this guy gives u a lot of $ does not give him the right to do whatever he wants

@realDonaldTrump So, Rod Rosenstein gets to testify in a closed, classified setting before 2 Dimms and 2 retiring GOP. No oath. No transcript. Free to continue to lie his Poindexter ass off. This is the ringleader of the coup folks. The treasonous SOB responsible. What???
@SecPompeo has been all over the place lately same as @realDonaldTrump . Hardest working administration in my lifetime. #MAGA
Gestures? Gestures? But @realDonaldTrump didn't call for his supporters or his party to specifically go bodyslam journalists or Democrats?! Did he? Why are you crying?! Democrats however have made specific call to action to terrorize Republicans and it's been acted upon. IDIOT!
. @realdonaldtrump is a weak leader who is afraid of everyone except immigrants. He thinks that he might be able to win a fight against some who is hungry and tired. Trump fights the weak because that's what rich asshole bullies do. #BeBest #MelaniaHypocrite #TrumpIsAnAsshole

In debate, really shitty FL GOP Gov candidate was asked if @realDonaldTrump was a good role model for children - so naturally, he answered by blathering about the US Embassy in Israel.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President. I know you don't have time to read all your tweets. But, I know this much. This so called "Caravan" is nothing more the an "Invasion" and it's test of your resolve and I back you 100% on what ever you do. pic.twitter.com/XnkGiDX9iM

Buster @realDonaldTrump ! I just signed my own executive order that you shush it 'til after Nov. 6th. Obey my order Buster! #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks

Also, as he's reading the teleprompter, he looks like there is a gun to his head, gritting his teeth. He hates to back down. Expect the @realDonaldTrump unleashed, reckless and destructive back at it again within 24 hours. Wonder who got him to say the presidential stuff. Ivanka?
Don't believe that bullshit from him or @realDonaldTrump follow the money @FBI

@realDonaldTrump F*ck You! pic.twitter.com/jPQSL4Mk4y
I'll be shocked and disappointed if President Trump stops criticizing Dems. His criticisms are valid, and our nation cannot afford to let their scare tactics work. Criticize them all you want, @realDonaldTrump ! I support you!
You think the "bombs" were sent by a Corey Booker supporter? He is being stupid by trying to stoop to @realDonaldTrump 's level. He is not very good at it. Watch your boy at his "rally" and listen to his words. He will step in it again.
It is impossible to divorce @realDonaldTrump from the fact that Trump has targeted each of the Democrats targeted by bombs today. Donald Trump's rhetorical hateful words have preceded the actions that intended to kill Democrats. Trump is responsible for the scorched Earth attack!
We need you in Florida @realDonaldTrump for @RonDeSantisFL . Please help!

My prediction is that @realDonaldTrump will say the EXACT same type of anti-press, anti-Democratic inflammatory rhetoric at his rally tonight that he has at every rally. Nothing will change.
Tune in to @WBAY online at http:// WBAY.com now, where @realDonaldTrump is speaking live.
@HardballChris How soon people forget! Some people think that maybe the Democrats concocted fake bombs to slow down trumps rallies! @MSNBC @morningmika @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump @larryelder @RealJamesWoods @IngrahamAngle MAGA pic.twitter.com/VU0FR2QxTS
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC U R NO PREZ OF US. CHANGE UR RHETORIC & STOP THIS. EVERYONE HERE IS EQUAL. U R TELLING IDIOTS 2 KILL-BE VIOLENT & U DID THIS. AND U WILL DO IT AGAIN. U R NOT QUALIFIED 2 BE MY PREZ. UR VIOLENT 'RALLIES' R AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE....GOP
@realDonaldTrump will not stop. Look at what is happening. People almost killed and what are we talking about? TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP. That is exactly what he wants.

@FoxNews is as desperate as @realDonaldTrump
And they have a possible 210,000,000 more seconds until Jan 2025 of HATE TRUMP @potus @realDonaldTrump ahead of them. I truly feel sorry for them.
@realDonaldTrump Had any of those bombs killed people, their blood would have been on your hands. Normally I wouldn't attribute blame in that way, but you incite, incite, incite violence and hate at every opportunity, so this one is yours.
Replying to @realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker and @LeahVukmir . Save America. Vote red
@realDonaldTrump wonder where someone would get the idea to use violence against the opposition? Maybe because you praise those who do. #WordsMatter Trump praises Gianforte for body slamming reporter https:// youtu.be/QwiaCUUScqc via @YouTube
. @MSNBC . @cnn . @realDonaldTrump #trumps MO is reverse psychology. Trump & his base have the same mentality & same IQ. He spews out irrational ideas at his rallies. Trump doesn't know any facts, which is why his rallies don't have substance & his base doesn't know any better!
Vote @realDonaldTrump 's CORRUPT @GOP out of power!
Very busy day in America. @kroger had a mass shooting, pipe bombs were sent to @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @CNN @RepMaxineWaters . Is this the "winning" you spoke of @realDonaldTrump and @GOP ? #FUMAGA
@realDonaldTrump choose right words for a change would be great
So, @realDonaldTrump basically just told the country DO AS I SAY NOT AS I DO, eh? His slogan should have been "Got violence?" for f*ck sake
@axlrose @Slash @gunsnroses News footage from another Trump rally tngt had G&R'"November Rain"playing in the background pre-rally. As an avid 31yr G&R fan,I implore you to please restrict @realDonaldTrump from playing your awesome tunes at his hateful, ego stroking rallies. #basta

@POTUS @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @WHITEHOUSE @NAACP @BLMLA
Chinese and Russian spies are listening in to President @realDonaldTrump 's iPhone calls: NYP reports
A real president would call up Hillary and the rest of the targets of these deadly bombs to offer support. A real president would cancel a partisan political rally and firmly condemn ALL violence. Instead, @realDonaldTrump has called NONE of the targets & will hold his rally.
This is not a both sides issue this is a @realDonaldTrump Fake 45, @GOP , and @FoxNews issue. They are the ones screaming like lunatics that @TheDemocrats are a mob they want to replace you with brown people. Scare tactics are the only thing they know because they can't beat us.
We get what we deserve. If we can't win the House back in November, and if we can't vote @realDonaldTrump out of office in 2020, then we deserve the douchebag.
@Scaramucci why don't u quit talking 4 @realDonaldTrump , you don't know what he means or doesn't mean.. your an idiot what is wrong with saying your a nationalist which means he advocates 4 political independence so just shut up & go away..
Trump called for unity because of the bombs sent to President Obama, Hillary Clinton and CNN. I laughed. A man who devotes most of his time to dividing the country wants us to come together as one. You're the problem @realDonaldTrump #ShitholePresident #Traitor #Fraud #Liar

@realDonaldTrump should have cancelled the rally; he knows the people he's whipped into a hate filled frenzy will be cheering these attempted murders.
Has anyone ever been to a @realDonaldTrump rally? I have and I can attest that the women there are some of the most gorgeous ones I have ever seen.
All the democrat politicians left their voters standing at the alter to go fight @realDonaldTrump in fear of losing their Washington gravy train
@CNN thankyou for covering this, but it's clear @realDonaldTrump promoted this terrorism and he is complicit in creating a militia who is committing acts of war on American soil. Trump has promoted terrorism, he failed to condemn it, and now it's happening. He caused it.
@realDonaldTrump no back to that Trojan Horse coming to our southern border!
@realDonaldTrump is the leader of a terrorist group. Inciting violence against his own country. TRAITOR

It was a terrorist act committed against our nation. Say the word, Name it. T...... Despicable a mild for a series of bomb attacks on two former American presidents. Name it, set the tone, call these act out @realDonaldTrump
Hmm, I wonder if this might contribute a disturbed person to go over the edge and maybe send a bomb to the media @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/JGiHJkS80C
U need to talk to your boss @realDonaldTrump who incites violence at every rally
@realDonaldTrump Lack of leadership and humanity. Earlier he said we need to.unify the country, so much for that. Two faced liar.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for reaching across the aisle and condemning this, even though it was only targeted at Dems

. @ChrisSununu said he'd welcome the endorsement of @realDonaldTrump . I'm done. His campaign likes to pretend he's a moderate, but the reality is that he's in lockstep with Trump's radical agenda. NH doesn't need that. #nhgov #nhpolitics
The thing that would calm the political divide would be the media & the dems reassuring the public that the 2016 election was fairly won by @realDonaldTrump & stop all the conspiracies & lies about him. That is what spills over to all the rest of the resist nonsense & violence.
America is gradually becoming one big dumb down society, thanks to @realDonaldTrump #MAGABomber
My exact thoughts. I would put nothing past the evil dems, look at the underhanded rigged scene they tried to pull with Kavanaugh. They are THAT desperate! Speaking of, Ford disappeared just as quick as she came! #RedWaveRising2018 #DemocratsAreDangerous @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump has said nothing bad about you yet.. Hillary Backfired, Russia Backfires Daca Backfires, Mexico Backfired, Puerto Rico Back Fired, Comey Backfired, Mueller Backfired, Roseanne Backfired, Kavanaugh Backfired, Ford Backfired, Stormy Backfired, Caravan Backfires,TBC

@realDonaldTrump and his #maga cultists need to be classified as a terror organization.
OK, since @realDonaldTrump has put himself on the ballot, there is only one thing to do..... #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2018 #BlueWave #TheResistance
@RepMarkWalker . Enough! It is time to call @realDonaldTrump out! Your defense of the indefensible is pathetic. Do. Your. Job.
What is it with @realDonaldTrump and adult entertainers? #SerialBomber
to bad maybe they should have thought abt their healthcare needs before helping to get Trumps lying ass elected to office they went for the con when @realDonaldTrump claimed he was gonna cover everyone with great great health insurance that is until he actually got in office
You, your party and Especially @realDonaldTrump fueled his hate! You lied, called democrat women names, mocked Clinton, Obama. Bashed the media and bullied. He praised violence at his hateful, inciteful kkk rallies! You people are a disgrace and a stain in American history!
Cesar Sayoc Jr., Alleged Mail Bomber, Threatened Democrats on Twitter https:// thebea.st/2OVdXlm ? source=twitter&via=desktop via @thedailybeast And he's a stripper. We all know @realdonaldtrump likes strippers. #themoreyouknow
@realDonaldTrump I think you need to tone down your tanning spray! Looking a bit orange Donnie! The truth is you have not toned down! Your tweets and rallies prove it! The media has nothing to do with it! Your written words and videos of your rallies show the truth! No respect! pic.twitter.com/DuD4IvYwBh

Hey @tedcruz remember when @realDonaldTrump talked trash about your wife and your dad. Is it painful having to pretend you like him? #savage
@realDonaldTrump when you point a finger, there are 3 fingers pointing back at you...everything you have said about media and bombings applies to you...you are are the arsonist in this bomb stuff
So we're only about 15 minutes into Charmed and I've already caught two stabs at @realDonaldTrump and I'm living for it.
Amazing @FoxNews moment Shep blames @realDonaldTrump and Chris Wallace calls him on it and Shep denies he said it. Shows how much hatred Shep has for DJT.
@nytimes Why aren't you running article after article about @realDonaldTrump 's phone. THIS IS A MAJOR STORY. REPORT ON IT LIKE YOU DID ON HILLARY'S EMAILS
I'm sure there'd be people saying that about @HillaryClinton if she had won in 2016. She isn't exactly great. @realDonaldTrump is WAY more worth the vote than Hillary "I told Bill Clinton's accuser to shut up " Clinton.
So this is the GRAND VIEW .. where I help people!! All while on break watching the news as people are out their killing each other. #STUPIDHUMANS @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/m4uPagXwDO

To the #TrumpAllies in the @GOP , @HouseGOP , & @SenateGOP , it's become quite obvious that @realDonaldTrump 's supporters possibly have in their midst people just like the #MAGABomber Cesar Sayoc. Is that what you want to be associated w/? Do you want to be the party of Trumpism?
Or @realDonaldTrump ... pic.twitter.com/e90IeknHfd
Oh I must have done something right cuz I got blocked by @realDonaldTrump ...I guess truth telling pisses him off
Somehow, also the fault of @realDonaldTrump !
And would vote for you and your colleagues cuz this constitutes part of the base that @realDonaldTrump is referencing and talking in code to when he says he's a nationalist(racist)
@realDonaldTrump MAGA; The greatest President ever!!!!
@realDonaldTrump only reason the media is to blame is they broadcast your pathetic rants & craziness. You want to see the culprit that started the fire look in the mirror ..
@realDonaldTrump President Trump , if you need more soldiers to go to the borders ,please call on our veterans. I am ready to serve my country again . thank you
No @realDonaldTrump is referring to himself.
Our #media must accept responsibility for its #BadReputation , which is not due to @realDonaldTrump but to the media's #scapegoatism & obnoxious, #disrespectful behavior. Like spoiled #brats , they whine & blame the President when THEY are at fault, starting w/ @CNN . pic.twitter.com/Eq77WRTVtU
Closer invaders come, fewer women & children in pics. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump should order pamphlets in several Central American & Middle Eastern languages dropped declaring caravan invasion act of war & warn invasion will be dealt w/ any force necessary, including deadly force
@realDonaldTrump has only been screaming that he has the IQ of a bag of dildos for DECADES

The good news is that GOP will win super majority in both houses in November 2018. Then Trump can clean house I DOJ!! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @GOP
"Negative attacks" = @realDonaldTrump 's feeling that it's not fair that the media airs video of him saying so many hateful and/or idiotic things. Truth hurts, asshole.

@realDonaldTrump is raising wages by tax breaks & reducing barriers. You have clearly said #Dems are against this! You have no plsn
@realScottWagner you are unhinged and unfit to be governor or even human. Disgusting that you promote violence against Tom Wolf. You are a @realDonaldTrump flunkie
Love our President!!! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS pic.twitter.com/ga9FiiV6aE
Would like to hear you @RickSantorum stand up and say that the targets the bomber chose aren't common threaded by @realDonaldTrump rhetoric.
@realDonaldTrump you can't unify people if you can't admit your part in tearing the unity apart. You have to be a big enough man to admit that and YOUR NOT!
Yes, definitely. It's time. I'll go step further. @realDonaldTrump 's unfit to be President of the United States of America. Trump's blaming media again tonight at rally in NC. Still hasn't reached out to intended victims of #MAGAbomber . No concept of job of POTUS. Independent
Dear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump could you please come to Albuquerque for a rally. I will be in attendance if you do with my Trump hat on.
Islam doesn't radicalize people, individuals do. You can support Islam and not support the individuals that misinterpret it. @realDonaldTrump directly radicalizes people through his words and actions. You cannot support him and his power with the same absolution.
@realDonaldTrump STOP BEING A COWARD AND SISSY. WE ARE TIRED OF YOUR SHIT. YOU ARE ASKING FOR TROUBLE YOU FUCKIN BASTARD. SOMEONE NEEDS TO ACT AGAINST THIS HITLER. VOTE DEMOCRAT!!!
This is ridiculous, just because we support @realDonaldTrump we get our accounts suspended, nothing wrong just because all my twits are Pro- Trump they lock my account, this is scary we are in the hands of a left socialist campaign, is enough to go through this!!! pic.twitter.com/x3acASG7dY
@SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump So when the terrorist car is covered in support for trump, red X's over targets faces, how will you spin this to the Democrats? I ask because I know you will never take responsibility for your words influencing him. You cant be adults
what's most surprising is not that @realdonaldtrump 's rhetoric incited violence, but that it happened in such a classic way- Trump supporter, old white guy with anger issues

Watching @realDonaldTrump #Rally on C.SPAN2 @cspan
Watch the Rally on @OANN Directv channel 347 #MAGA . No kook will stop us from voting for @realDonaldTrump supporters. Those receiving packages were those who VOCALLY CALLED FOR violence against Trump family-GOP
@realDonaldTrump You incite violence, you get violence. You keep opening your big mouth, you should be held accountable, and charged on felony charges.
Does anyone else ever cast spells on @realDonaldTrump ?
#MAGA #BuildTheWall #DrainTheSwamp This is the winning ticket for the GOP ! Enough said @realDonaldTrump #USA
When will @realDonaldTrump question whether the arrested bomber is a real Native American or ask if he's related to @SenWarren ? #MAGABomber

@realDonaldTrump invoked the 2nd Amendment when talking about Clinton. Miss me with interrupting meals, public shaming or protesting by the left. NOT THE SAME! @GOP , you failed!! #FalseEquivalency #unfit #MAGAbomber
@realDonaldTrump No, media has no role to play with your vile and vicious rhetoric, it is all you so shut the hell up about the mainstream media. Go tell it to fake Fox News you damn whiner.
You know the theory that @realDonaldTrump is actually a genius politician because he has so many scandals and moments of incompetence that we lose focus on all of them? Seems like @MattForMontana , @GregForMontana , Corey Stapleton are trying it out in Montana this week. #mtpol
Te he he. I got #RealNews for them. They've been exposed & they's no turning back no matter how big the hissyfits they throw get. I'm betting @realDonaldTrump is just gonna keep calling em out for what the are. And he needs us to keep cheering him on for all we're worth. #Winning
@realDonaldTrump just shut your pie hole. The media is doing NOTHING WRONG. It is your pathetic @$$ we are hoping the blue wave wins

However the only one actually using the situation to score points is @realDonaldTrump You are the moral leader of the United States and it's your responsibility to calm tensions and meaningfully call for unity.
MSM needs to drop the soft labels and call it like it is. These bombs were an act of terrorism acted upon by the direction of #Cult45 's ring leader, @realDonaldTrump . I'm not going to spare his feelings if he's not going to spare our lives. #TruckFump #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/lCYC9IRcu3

@realDonaldTrump I guess they caught your buddy. Now what?
@realDonaldTrump show's ratings revolve around amplifying hate, anger and bigotry! He will never change. Vote his corrupt @GOP out of power!
"I think they're looking pretty good...But I'm here tonight because we can't take any chances," @realDonaldTrump says.
@SecretService may want to look at shutting down @realDonaldTrump rallies as it is pretty clear that domestic terrorists are now being radicalized there.
Then your lying when you said that you have been to a number of his rallies or you wear ear plugs. This one is no different and the people are loving @realDonaldTrump
@Twitter should take a stance on the violence @realDonaldTrump is inciting. His slanderous tweets directed at specific individuals should be treated as every other abusive tweet and his account should be CLOSED! Wake up, America- he is DANGEROUS and inciting VIOLENCE! #Vote

This is the America that @realDonaldTrump has given us. And you support him.
Of what relevance is this news to u? @POTUS has a lot to sort out. So many will take care of that. You report all the negative of @realDonaldTrump . This is unfair. Loopsided news. You must change now.

@realDonaldTrump during Trump's run for the Presidency everyone considered him an outsider, then Trump became Potus, but I think crooked CNN the media the Democrats the establishment consider him still an outsider. #JellyBellyFriday
So we should put armed guards in every house of worship, every restaurant, every grocery store, every movie theater, every gas station. Everywhere? Does this #MAGA @realDonaldTrump ?
How dare @realDonaldTrump suggest we arm synagogues... and not to set a standard of moral behavior, get rid of guns, and to make a stand against anti Semitic and racist prople in his administrative swamp and in his base . He is just disgusting #UnfitForOffice
Do you all remember when @RonDeSantisFL and @realDonaldTrump were in heated words? Well I sure do. DeSantis realized that Trump was doing great for our country and decided to join the @The_Trump_Train This train is growing everyday.
@realDonaldTrump THAT SEALS THE DEAL! THEY ARE INVADERS AND MUST BE STOPPED BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! YOU HAVE THE MANDATE WE ELECTED YOU FOR TO STOP! DO WHAT EVER IT TAKES TO DENY THEM ENTRY!
Very sad indeed Sarah. Just like the bigotry and hate that we all see aimed towards you and our great President here on this post each and every day. You should all be ashamed of yourself. This is typical leftists bullying. Stay strong Sarah. We you. @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Looking over the amount of dollars being given to foreign nations at https://www. foreignassistance.gov . How is the way this money is allocated & spent accounted for? 27.7 bn is a lot of wall.
We want to say this to the people of Germany you are so lucky to have @AngelaMerkeICDU We know some do not like her. Be proud that you do not have @realDonaldTrump . @BILD_English @TheLocalGermany #Germany @RTLde @GermanyDiplo @guardian @AP @washingtonpost @rosemaryCNN @nytimes
@realDonaldTrump @JustinTrudeau & @theresa_may were not invited.The questions were raised about Late Jamal Khashoggi. We again thank @AngelaMerkeICDU response " There will be a joint Reaction once @AdelAljubeir & @KingSalman gives answers" Yemen was also her concern.
. @realDonaldTrump you clearly understand nothing about mass killers, they commit these acts knowing, wanting to be killed in the effort. Threat of the death penalty doesn't deter crime, that's a fact. So to say threat of the death penalty would stop mass shootings is asinine
I'm sure this is the #iPhone that @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS uses to access @Twitter to send out his tweets and talk to people like family, friends and others, that's non-classified/top secret, however I'm sure for official business i.e. classified/top secret matters it is secured.
@realDonaldTrump Armed worshipers!? The root cause mr "president" isn't religion or weapons its #Hate and your unwitting promotion, and yes, weponization of it. Period!

You can blame @realDonaldTrump for his "Globalist" dog whistling.
I already voted 100% GOP for #MAGA & @realdonaldtrump Our POTUS needs ever single GOP on the ballot
I know @realDonaldTrump could never have empathy, a heart or show compassion, care and love like President @BarackObama but instead of him going to that rally he should've been in Pittsburgh showing some kind of care & love for those who lost loved ones but that's just me.
I never voted for him what makes him think I want his version of democracy? Time to take money like his out of politics. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump - I am tired of having someone in the White House who doesn't care about making our country better. Why are you never outraged? It could have been your family ( if they ever really go to synagogue) This violence towards people who are different has got to stop!
. @realDonaldTrump No mercy for terrorists?? Oh good, then does that mean no mercy for Saudi scum and no mercy for your pals, the Zionists either?? Let's hope so !
and donnie will say he had more people at his me, me, me rally..won't you @realDonaldTrump #Magabomber
@realDonaldTrump NEVER said "Nazis" or Neo Nazis are 'fine people." Part of the Big Lie. In Charlottesville 2 groups protested originally - those who wanted statues to say & those who wanted them to be torn down. Trump said there were "good people on both sides." 2/3
Again, crooked @realDonaldTrump is an evil cloud that has to be dispersed! #TreeOfLifeSynagogue #GunControlNow #ImpeachTrumpNow #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
@realDonaldTrump Immigrant caravan - Would it be a good idea to confront and assist them BEFORE they get to the border. The liberal news media is foaming at the mouth to get their cameras on them right on our border. Is someone trying to get them here before election day?
Whatever, evil will happen with or without @realDonaldTrump .
The right likes to say Obama LIED when saying if you like you plan, you can keep it. MOST people did keep their plan and their doctor. What comes out of Trump's mouth everyday, are outright, provable lies. Today: Wall St. was open the day after 9/11. @realdonaldtRump #maga
@realDonaldTrump
White nationalism is a war against the modern, multicultural, democratic world. Very similar to the motivation of ISIS. And that's @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump I think you're doing a phenomenal job, President Trump, and am praying for the Republican party to have GREAT success in these upcoming Mid-term elections. Hope the democrats get DECIMATED!!! I'm from Toronto, Ontario.
If you really cared, you would do more to stop @realDonaldTrump and his hateful #rhetoric #Hypocrites
It's thanks to the hateful rhetoric and lies which spew from your mouth & racist Pussygrabber ( @realDonaldTrump ) which are DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for this horror & the mailed bombs from the previous week. Perhaps you & your boss should reassess what the fuck you are saying!!!
@GOP @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump when will the Republican Party realize that the NRA is the enemy of the state.?
@realDonaldTrump Pt.5 My response. Once President Trump is apprised of this atrocity, he will take action against these alleged criminals!!!...and these are criminals!!!
Like they did for everything, I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow @realDonaldTrump and @FoxNews ( @IngrahamAngle , @marklevinshow , @TuckerCarlson @rushlimbaugh , @LouDobbs ... say that 11 dead in the mass shooting at Pittsburgh Synagogue was a hoax.
And the world would be a much better place if you were a true leader that cared about all, not just yourself #narcissist @realDonaldTrump . #MAGASynagogueShooter #FreePress

@GOP 's Thoughts & Prayers aren't working. Americans Demand #SensibleGunLaws . @realDonaldTrump Americans shouldn't need an Armed Guard to Pray at Church. #WhiteNationalism is an Assault on Humanity. #TrumpRussia #VoteDEMOCRATIC For America.

Equally importantly, we need to combat the culture of hate and violence that @realDonaldTrump has perpetuated with every fiber of our being!

@USSupremeCourt @realDonaldTrump Yes Do Take A Two Year Shutdown For Caucus To Change This Into A Central Management Office Knowledgeable Of The Finite Of Workings.. Invite Business And Those From The 11,000 Member Commonwealth..
Yes, and @realDonaldTrump is radicalizing them by his twitter feed with all the hatred and lies he spews!
The message of @realdonaldtrump in his speeches is clear when he says that the nation must reunite he means that the Democrats must reunite with him & that the media must conform to the Fox news to the propaganda of the state is not a message of union but a threat to obey.
Miss his compassion. At best @realdonaldtrump grudgingly reads a teleprompter speech he neither believes nor cares about.
This is something @DonaldJTrumpJr pervert GF would come up with maybe she helped the #magabomber , while @LouDobbs watched and the called @realDonaldTrump to confirm everything is fake news

@realDonaldTrump is just a walking Facebook post
The same conspiracies @realdonaldtrump and @foxnews spread. They are radicalizing right wing nuts.
The only thing shameful is you. These proud young black Americans are thinking for themselves & turning away from you and your anti @realDonaldTrump rhetoric. Trump was good enough when you needed him or his $ but now you stand in judgement of him. God will judge U in the end.
The more the left hates @realDonaldTrump the more I know he is on track. I judge how much I like something he does by how much hate the left spews.

@realDonaldTrump Demoncrats use real bullets to murder innocents! Why do they hate Jews?
Liar. @realDonaldTrump NEVER called "immigrants" animals. He called MS-13 ANIMALS - would you like to speak to the parents of a young girl murdered by MS-13 & call then "divine sparks?" Soros may be Jewish but he's an ENEMY OF ISRAEL. He NEVER said "Nazis" are fine people 1/2
. @realDonaldTrump After the #SynagogueShooting you say antisemitism should be condemned. Mr. President, I condemn you and your supporters for demonizing George Soros, a Jewish Holocaust survivior who has used his wealth to benefit others.

@BarackObama Do you ever wonder why you have almost twice the amount of followers as @realDonaldTrump and Twitter now says most of his are fake?
@realDonaldTrump I agree with you- if we cower down and change our lives because we are afraid, we have let the evil ones and the Deep State win
Always a dual message. @realDonaldTrump says one thing as #POTUS n a different thing as a #politician . We say the same thing, each time, this #Trump thing will come to past, sooner than u think.

Well perhaps @RealDonaldTrump will care when his inaction is tied to genocide. But everyone in #GOP answers to The church of Donald Trump and Latter Day Nationalists, so I would not be very hopeful.
@realDonaldTrump You claim to be a businessman, but facts "Anticipating market chaos, panic selling and a disastrous loss of value in the wake of the attacks, the NYSE and the Nasdaq remained closed UNTIL September 17, the longest shutdown since 1933." YOU LIED IN #Illinois #VOTE
So Hugh, your saying @realDonaldTrump 's support of white nationalists and vitriol about his political opponents and the media has no connection with inciting violent acts? Doesn't jibe with the history books.

Holy fuck it just occurred to me that @realDonaldTrump is watching The Purge movies on cable for Halloween season and is thinking these are amazing training films for his American Neo-Orange Youth (ANOY) movement.
@realDonaldTrump Instead of campaigning constantly, moron, why don't you spend time in deep deliberate thought & study about the issues Presidents should concern themselves with. We are paying you to run for President for 4 years instead of being President?

You are NOT an American!!! You are the enemy... you and all other #FakeNews are dividing our nation. Not @realDonaldTrump . You talk trash about our President multiple times per day. I hated @BarackObama but I dealt with it for 8 years!! Now we are on the track to success. #MAGA

But the media DOES accurately report what he says. Which to @realDonaldTrump makes them his enemy.
So @realDonaldTrump is visiting @CityofPgh tomorrow? Odd since he was told to "Not step into Pennsylvania until he denounces white nationalists." But what do I know? He's going to a city that resoundingly voted against him in 2016, to comfort a Jewish congregation that believes
I can't agree more. He's trying to impress his audience, so it can say oh look Macron is standing to @realDonaldTrump . He's still a product of globalists. They put him there to save the EU. Time will tell.
@realDonaldTrump until Republicans apologize for you being president, they will no longer be a party I consider a legitimate political organization. You are wrong and they are wrong. In everyway imaginable!
@realDonaldTrump Please, sir, respect the wishes of the people of Philly. Let them bury their dead in peace. Your visit will disrupt a city already stretched thin. For your safety and theirs, stay home Tuesday.
@jaketapper @pattieDavis is right.Reporter should stop asking @realDonaldTrump any question.He just lies anyway. #stopaskinghimquestion
@realDonaldTrump has been a defender and protector of the Jewish community in the USA and Israel. He has been a true friend of the Jewish people everywhere. May he continue winning!

@realDonaldTrump President Trump. Thankk God you are sending more military for the borders. Have all the borders in those states send in their national guard. I made a comment to Martinez in NM. She turned on us. I told her to send water trucks to use if crowd gets out of control
If we skip to 49:30, in this video @realDonaldTrump says he would be @cnn 's biggest fan if they reported fairly, he's ok with criticism as long as it's honest. @ScottAdamsSays https:// youtu.be/jE4FuwR5CDU
@AprilDRyan President Trump is an American Nationalist. The only color @realDonaldTrump sees is green. He wants to help all Americans see lots of green in their pockets.
@realDonaldTrump should go to the southern border and watch his military parade. He wanted one now he has one!
@georgesoros must be handed over to Israel and @netanyahu and tried for crimes against Israel and the Israeli people. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump "....called for Americans to "unify" and strive for civility..." Sure, OK, no problem. You go first.

@cnn promoted @realDonaldTrump during the primaries, giving him hundreds of millions of dollars of free air time, thinking @HillaryClinton would destroy him, then once he was the nominee they turned on him. As far as I'm concerned he will always be the #CNNpresident haha

Matt all that cable news does is report the facts and what other people are saying. Your comments are not fair. @realDonaldTrump needs to stop lying to the American public about fake news, caravans with middle eastern men and isis, crowd size and decent people on both sides
Isn't the crypt keeper @KellyannePolls Jewish? Didn't she say she was a victim of sexual assault? @realDonaldTrump must be grabbing u by ur p@ssy & paying u from those taxes & payments from the Russians 4u2 sell ur "soul". Do this need to happen 2 you'll DIRECTLY 4u2 get da point
So @realDonaldTrump thinks churches should have armed personnel. FOUR of the trained police officers were shot. They couldn't defend themselves against an AR-15, so unless you want EVERYONE to carry around AR-15s, then maybe you should rethink this inept blather.

@realDonaldTrump Tell em all.....that you will accommodate fiscal policy even further to offset The Fed rate hikes at unreasonable magnitudes and pace.
@realDonaldTrump we hope you do not let one migrant into our country no matter what anyone says. Your base is asking you to keep em out
Whether or not @realDonaldTrump can even address it by EO since it's a matter of existing statute is another story. Perhaps within the confines of U.S. enclaves overseas, but I doubt it.
Donald Trump and his whole administration are in the clutches of the Israel Lobby. That being the case, I'm still trying to figure out what @realDonaldTrump has to do with anti-Semitic violence. Let me know, though.

Respectfully disagree. If you are here illegally, your offspring have no right to US citizenship. On this, @realDonaldTrump is right. As usual. I will still vote for you as Menendez is a disgrace.

@realDonaldTrump Please, please stop accusing the media of being the enemy. There are too many idiots that don't know the difference between MSNBC and the local NBC station and some local reporter is going to get hurt, or worse. Please stop!!
@realDonaldTrump is there anybody in there?
@VP you are wrong. Nice legalese chat speach but you are wrong. Read the 14th amendment. And maybe read it with @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump you are treating our country, this election and the immigration issue like a reality show. You don't care about anything or anyone but yourself.
Constitution does not confer citizenship to children of Illegals. #USA statute Is the problem. The @Scotus has never ruled on It and If they did @realDonaldTrump would win. The practice Is ridiculous on Its face. @WhiteHouse
@realDonaldTrump You didn't mind birthright citizenship when your Russian friends wanted in on the deal. #Hypocrite #Liar #RussianAsset #PutinsPoodle
@realDonaldTrump #Putin @GOP will stoop to anything to stay in power! Talk about a totalitarian fascist pigs!
@POTUS @RealDonaldTrump "End Birthright Citizenship"?? You had no problem giving citizenship to that gold digging porn hag that you married...her chain migrating parents and her sister!! Who the hell do you think you are?

On @realDonaldTrump : Since the nation is defined by its inherent virtue rather than by its future potential, politics becomes a discussion of good and evil rather than a discussion of possible solutions to real problems.
@realDonaldTrump you pay for it. Walking refugees do NOT require that. Pay for PTSD treatment also for these migrant families from your abuse and war crimes.
@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/Fehm4Ve7vT
@realDonaldTrump I highly recommend that you seek treatment for your mental problems. It helps. If you are to be our president for much longer you must seek medical help. No references to your actions, statements, or tweets are needed to support the evidence that you need help.
News flash! That is all @realDonaldTrump has EVER focused on.
There is nothing @realDonaldTrump has done can be described as loving.

@realDonaldTrump , YOU unqualified, both as a human being and as a president. This is the conspiracy theory started by the Campbell Soup executive (he was fired after the shooting for this) and it was apparently the final straw for the Pittsburgh man who killed 11 Jews.
