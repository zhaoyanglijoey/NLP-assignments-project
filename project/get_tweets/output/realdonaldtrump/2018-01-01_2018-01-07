The people of Iran are toppling the Government, now this is MAGA @realDonaldTrump
$7.25 federal #MinimumWage is a shame. Disgrace. Inhumane. I dare @realDonaldTrump or any politician who supports this to live one month taking $7.25 wage. Kudos to 18 states who are raising the number.
Just think if the Iranian People had GUNS to defend themselves against the dictatorship, it would soon be over. The Obama dictatorship couldn't get off the ground because of our weapons. Thank GOD for @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump not surprised that CNN supports legal pot.After all they seem to be wack jobs anyway.Maybe they are toooo busy smoking pot to fact they check their stories.The fake news problem could actually be a pot problem. Sometimes at night Don lemon looks stoned. lol
. @realDonaldTrump since you have become president, planes average taking off and landing 3 hours late. Wtf did you do and fix this fast or you're the worst president ever. (Lol jk you are the worst president ever and nothing will change that) #maga
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Why did the ERA fail? Why was it never resurrected? The country of Iceland just mandated that all employers employing 25 or more people must pay women the same as they pay men for doing the same job! Maybe it's time we followed their lead!
Dear Prince Harry-tell @realDonaldTrump to fuck off. Invite whoever you want. Obama's would bring a great gift too.

@realDonaldTrump Please stop all the gov/t handouts Elon Musk talked Obama out of. If his companies cannot thrive on their own, let them go out of business. Taxpayers are sick of this bullshit.

#MAGA Tickets Crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to get out & vote for @realDonaldTrump and kick it BIG TIME!
The only way to get results would be if @POTUS @realDonaldTrump appoints Special Counsel. IGs are powerless and Trump is the TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL. @TheJusticeDept @FBI are clearly obstructing justice and the buck stops with Trump. It's his administration! @WhiteHouse
If one looks at @realDonaldTrump as a CEO visiting and checking Trump company services for himself, one could regard him as very hard working indeed. If he didn't happen to have a whole other job as President of the United States, that is.
@realDonaldTrump is a small sad man
The Russian bots are deep in the twitter feed of @realDonaldTrump .

Does this mean all @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump brand companies will stop using slave labour? Oh right - I thought not.
@realDonaldTrump beside criticizing PAK on Twitter , You should practically utilize Atomic Bomb on the intelligence Agency (ISI) of Pakistan to protect the world from this Devil (PAK) & terrorism!!! PAK is striving to create hardships for the humanity, now u have to forbid them.
All you had to do was organize weekday general strikes in all economic centers and @realDonaldTrump would have had to resign right after inauguration.
They don't want @realDonaldTrump getting the credit. Their future is getting darker by the day. @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @JohnKerry @brhodes @Comey Get those ankle bracelets or room and board with three square meals a day.

My final comment. Anyone who doesn't think that We the People was the reason @realDonaldTrump is @Potus does not care about America. It wasn't #SteveBannon It wasn't #Russia It wasn't @WikiLeaks It was regular people who love their country and wanted to #MAGA

if @realDonaldTrump is a genius then i must be albert fucking einstein reincarnated
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sure, you're a genius and your dick is huge, and women love it when you assault them, and your tax returns prove your wealth. Fool your rube base, not the rest of us. #thenub secret service code name. #citruspuppet
There's only one way to confirm @realDonaldTrump is a #genius : #Jeopardy ... #POTUS v. Anyone.
What fkng triumphs? There are no triumphs to ignore. What's being ignore is your reporting on @realDonaldTrump s fkng mental state, his paranoia, his growing dementia, possible no-polar disease. Of course that's expected from #TrumpStateNews .
@realDonaldTrump NEWSFLASH you are a laughing stock around the world.
It would be helpful if @realDonaldTrump were arrested immediately, tried, convicted and put behind bars as soon as humanly possible.

@realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @SheriffClarke @RealJamesWoods @JulianAssange @PrisonPlanet
Why should @realDonaldTrump show up to an event where you will disrespect and slander him? It is not his fault spoiled celebrities backed an unlikeable, corrupt candidate, touting failed policies and the American people rejected her.
@realDonaldTrump then everyone that you've insulted could file a lawsuit against you right?

@realDonaldTrump The MSM and ignorant liberals trying to drive President Trump from office, only thing They're driving is each other batty as hell, and doing a fine job of it.
@realDonaldTrump wants 18 billion dollars of taxpayer money for his stupid wall! TAXPAYER MONEY FOR A STUPID WALL while making deep cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, & Social Security! HELL WITH THE ELDERLY THEIR ALMOST DEAD ANYWAY! LETS BUILD THAT WALL INSTEAD OF TAKING CARE OF THEM!

Bragging that @realDonaldTrump will not be President.
@realDonaldTrump No it wouldn't be very helpful if the US had stronger libel laws.Only tyrants, despots, & authoritarians silence the written word. However it would be helpful for you to act with dignity. If you can't stand the heat in the oval office, get out of the White House.
@SenToomey in light of your legislative advocacy related to North Korea, do you have anything to say about @realDonaldTrump 's incendiary tweets and their effect on our nation's attempts to deal with a nuclear North Korea? Or will you maintain your habit of cowardly silence?
@realDonaldTrump claims Fire and Fury is false, but still mercilessly attacks Bannon on Twitter... so is "Mr. like, really smart" attacking Bannon for no reason then?

Declaring yourself "a very stable genius" is declaring your instability. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you said "And, in theory, everybody tells me I'm not under investigation." What does that mean? Do people say to you, "Mr. President theoretically you are not under investigation. But realistically you are."
@realDonaldTrump tell me Boy, what type of visa did Taylor Wilson have? I ask you on the basis of your promoting to the nation that terrorist come from abroad.

The more @CNN attacks @realDonaldTrump the more they'll get a reverse or rather an opposite reaction (reverse psychology) from the public especially his loyal supporters. @AC360 @CNNTonight I'm not saying this as a supporter but as an observer

Hey @realDonaldTrump , did you know that President Obama could hold his breath underwater for 10 minutes? Can you do that?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS sends out minions to defend his "like smart" &stable reputation.yikes!they yell, ignore questions, disrespect hosts, invent fake facts,&disgust viewers.Not the best way to paint a picture of mental stability #sad #ImpeachTrump
If having a successful reality tv show makes @realDonaldTrump a genius than I guess Snooki & crew from The Jersey Shores as well as the Kardashian's are geniuses to.

It really is uncanny how much @realDonaldTrump attempts to deceive. He states deliberate falsehoods (read: lies) and expects everyone to believe him. He says "I'm a very stable genius," yet we know better. Or, "My inauguration crowd was the biggest." Photos prove otherwise. SAD!
