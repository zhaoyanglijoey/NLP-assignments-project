@realDonaldTrump Sir, maybe now is the time to start using the military to protect our borders. A deployment to the areas of the border that are hard to patrol, might, show your intent to keep our borders safe and would make Congress finally realize that you mean business.
@realDonaldTrump at what point are you coming on TV tonight to take responsibility for the market drop? I believe you once said the president is to blame.
@realDonaldTrump The time is over due to take control of the DOJ, the Mueller witch hunt, the FBI, our border, our trade policies, criminal sanctuary cities & a corrupt Republican congress that needs to be called out & named by U as subversives out to block the America 1st agenda

What do you mean @realDonaldTrump , when you say that we have no country without a border wall with Mexico (but apparently we DO have a country without a border wall with Canada)? Why is that @realDonaldTrump ? #NoWall #DACA #MAGA #RacistPOTUSTrump #grifter
@realDonaldTrump Just wondering; do you speak two languages? Most Mexicans speak fluent Spanish & theY also speak English. They work (something you never do) serve in our #Military (you never did) & care about others (you NEVER HAVE)

The @realDonaldTrump is correct he cheated the American people for over a decade by hiding his past. #UnsealObamaRecords all of them to find out.
I agree with you. Congress, specifically @SenateGOP @SenateDems are a threat to the well-being of Americans and this nation. Everyone of them need to be voted out and new voted in. They are obstructing the agenda Americans voted for with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump .
Right now we have a good amount of army. And dont you think as the President of the United States think that its shady that you can buy a gun on the internet with no background checks.But its whatever..... @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Did you just hear @SenatorTimScott just call you a racist on Martha Mcallum's show?

@realDonaldTrump The post office was never intended to make a profit you moron. It is a SERVICE, that provides the ability for any American to send and receive mail. No matter where the live! Just leave the office, you are pathetic.
So @realDonaldTrump has a problem with bulk shipping discounts through the @USPS ? Then we should expect his campaign and allied groups to pay the full first-class postage rate for fundraising letters and voter communication, right? #amazon
I do buy from Amazon, but need to go buy more...take that @realDonaldTrump ...
He's a 70 year old toddler, so everyday with @realdonaldtrump feels like a week, no wonder he goes through staff & wives so fast! I see why Putin would choose him for his enemy's leader, under #trump / #gop rule the country will be haggard, indebted & uneducated.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS is right - 'Keep your friends close and your enemies closer'; makes sense to me. Pres Trump & Putin have a healthy respect for each other, same can`t be said of @HillaryClinton who Putin must have looked upon with disdain.

They will get richer and richer if they oust @POTUS - by sacrificing majority - which @SpeakerRyan is doing- @realDonaldTrump WILL be impeached by dems in house- quickly followed by convicted by RINO's/Dems in Senate.. Donors /China keep forking over $$ to Ryan/McConnell
you can't blame this all on @realDonaldTrump . the Dems, as well as the Republicans, need to corporate in order to get anything done.

@realDonaldTrump working on new book, "Art of the Moron." "Trump Urges $100 Billion in New China Tariffs, Stoking Tensions" Yo Trumpster, how about actually sitting at a table and making an actual deal? #WorstPresidentEver
Does @realDonaldTrump know how anything works in the government?
Another blow to small business from the fake potus Dolt45/ @realDonaldTrump 100 billion more in tariffs which will be countered by China to the tune of 100 billion. Nobody loses but small business in this so called trade war. Getting harder to believe he's for the little guy.
. @realDonaldTrump God damn, liar. "Not a conspiracy theory, folks," President Donald Trump said in West Virginia on Thursday. "Millions and millions of people."
@realDonaldTrump I'm 68 and have never voted Democratic in my life. Much more of this trade war and I'll help give you a Democratic Congress to deal with after the mid-terms.

Still can't believe @realDonaldTrump is president. It's just amazing.
I LOVE @realDonaldTrump keep tweeting brotha
@Pontifex @realDonaldTrump @10DowningStreet @SenSanders @jeremycorbyn @RonWyden @georgegalloway @tedcruz @Nigel_Farage @RandPaul @RoyalFamily @MikeCrapo @IdahoGOP @IdahoDems @IdahoOnYourSide @ieichenlaub1
With these type of tweets you show two things:1) projection of your inner most feared faults and 2) your lack of ability to think except in the most superficial manner ...Want to grow & see more? We'll gladly give you @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain ticket. Is really glorious!
@realDonaldTrump So. Let's see if we understand this correctly. The Trump Tower fire is the 2nd blaze in your "well built" sprinkler-free residential building, eh? And in the late 90s you lobbied against sprinklers in buildings. Excellent. ....
Fake News by @realDonaldTrump about #SyriaChemicalAttack , pic.twitter.com/3uHibLlmhW
Trump fought fire legislation and refused to install sprinklers on residential floors of Trump Tower https://www. rawstory.com/?p=1251149 via rawstory . @realDonaldTrump . @IvankaTrump Appalling disregard for human life. Hope everyone sues you for the cheap, ignorant slumlords you are.
That because our POTUS has balls. Something Obama definitely lacked. Keep making America Great Again @realDonaldTrump !! We finally have a president we can be proud of.

. @MichaelCohen212 is enough of a thin-skinned crybaby that he even threatens @harvardlampoon staff over @realDonaldTrump getting harmlessly pranked. Get over yourself, Michael! #60Minutes
@realDonaldTrump .....so what if someone dies, and firefighters get injured? What's a dead body here or there? What's it to you? The important thing is --- you saved money. Btw, hope you DID save money. You'll need it for the crippling lawsuits coming your way.
@realDonaldTrump Respectfully Commander in Chief, how do you fire a true Patriot H.R. McMaster and you praise an elitist Capitalism like Scott Pruitt? Pruitt is the swamp you promised to drain. He lives off our tax dollars. Pruitt needs to go.
Something shady going on when @realDonaldTrump says he want to leave Syria, then attack happens, and the media seems to want him to stay and send more troops! #LetsInvestigateThisTime
@realDonaldTrump Mr.President please do not talk to Mueller
Assad is defending his country from foreign fighters and since @realDonaldTrump has declared US is pulling out of Syria, neither Assad nor Russia has anything to gain from more bombing. Israel and the Saudis have a lot more to gain.
@realDonaldTrump Justice to be a strike on the head of the tyrant Bashar
You realize this tweet could apply to @realDonaldTrump He is attacking his political enemies daily. See his latest tweets today. He would have them all put in jail to distract from his own culpability.
more fake news from the fake news master @realDonaldTrump ! As he says so often - Making America Fake is Great
@realDonaldTrump I don't want another war, but you do need to respond to Syria. You drew the line last time if he used chemical weapons were used again...they were used...time to follow through. I trust you and know you have to back your word.
Just found out my 14 year-old daughter got blocked by @realDonaldTrump on Instagram. It took her making fun of his hair on 52 separate posts. I have a new hero. #BlockedByTrump
@realDonaldTrump @VP @AmbJohnBolton President Trump should never just drag on the matter of the demoniac North Korea till next May. Strike North Korea in essential part and exterminate Kim Jong Un mmediately. Destroy all of the Korean Peninsula, so that all those commies die.
#StopPompeo : We need @clairecmc & @SenateDems to commit to blocking @realdonaldtrump 's #Pompeo nomination for Sec. of State. #DiplomacyWorks pic.twitter.com/8QnWAHfHZG
@realDonaldTrump OH, NO. LET'S NOT BLAME 'THE DONALD.' FOR GOD'S SAKE, LET'S NOT MAKE OUR PREZ RESPONSIBLE 4 ANYTHING. SOUNDS JUST LIKE NIXON, DOESN'T HE? "I RESIGN." GREATEST WORDS NIXON EVER SAID. MIGHT TRY THEM U LIAR.
Now can we indict @realDonaldTrump , this time for at least manslaughter?
