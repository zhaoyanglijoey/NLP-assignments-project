You're a wimp. Whining like a big baby as soon as our great @POTUS was on the plane. @realDonaldTrump is the most powerful man on the planet. Don't you forget it.
@realDonaldTrump is Dunning-Kruger effect on steroids, except with small hands.

You dont speak for all Americans Senator, count me out. When offered elimination of all tariffs, Trudeau demurred. They want to play chicken well, @realDonaldTrump doesn't blink. #JustinTrudeau
Really? Hum...I am a conservative, I support my President @realDonaldTrump , I DO NOT, I repeat I DO NOT CARE what @LindseyGrahamSC thinks this weekend, he will stab @POTUS next week if his powerful donors order him to, so try something else @ABC .

That is why Putin helped @realDonaldTrump to be in the White House.
@realDonaldTrump @dennisrodman talked to #KimJongUn years ago. Remember @realDonaldTrump fired @dennisrodman from the show. This has been planned for ages
. @realDonaldTrump has got to get that face lift scheduled He looks old, haggard, & wrinkled
@realDonaldTrump Please don't give Little Rocket Boy what he wants & needs most. A photo with YOU, shaking hands. He'd be happy, if that was ALL he comes home with & YOU lose a TON of bargaining power, the second he gets that picture! Praying like crazy you don't! It's NOT #MAGA

This is why we need more people like @realDonaldTrump and fewer like @SenJohnMcCain and the previous occupant of the White House.
There's enough Russians for @realDonaldTrump to feel right at home.
Donny boy, you're an imbecile #mentalillness @realDonaldTrump #POTUS
It amazes me that supposedly intelligent people like Navarro dont watch anything but Fox news. Trudeau and many other government representatives have said for a couple weeks that the actions of @realDonaldTrump were insulting. Many news stations have broadcast those comments
God help US if @JohnBrennan 's concept of America returns. We barely survived you and your ilk's dream of a globalist one world order. You have been defeated, Mr. Brennan. Thank God for @realDonaldTrump
real @lopezobrador_ (El Peje) is asking for a reunion with @realDonaldTrump , but he says that Donald must certify that he will respect him. We must advice that El Peje is acting as if he is already the mexican president (but is not). @nytimes @CarlosLoret @aguilarcamin
The funniest thing is that even with the Sun using their hero shots of @realDonaldTrump and @fordnation , and what I guess is their loser shot of @JustinTrudeau , he still comes off looking more like a leader than those two dopes.

@realDonaldTrump has alienated all our democratic allies and is saddling up to every dictator. It seems pretty telling that Donald only likes and supports countries where he can extort money and gain bribes and trade, like China & Russia. He is a traitor and #PutinsPuppet

That's the truth (for the first time ever from #faux news) and isn't that pathetic!! #toomanylies @foxnew @realdonaldtrump
@foxnation - all these pundits criticizing Trumpian methods can all get lost! Trump is PRESIDENT not them & is getting results. Thank you @realDonaldTrump
When we get it back from @PutinRF asset @realDonaldTrump you will be reminded of this.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump We are praying for you and the meeting in Singapore. God bless you in all your endeavors.
@realDonaldTrump Your ass is phat
And by the way, @realDonaldTrump is undermining his own thirst for a legacy here - without the documentary record, there will be no basis for reevaluating contemporary judgments of the administration.
Jonah Goldberg goes so way over the top with his @realDonaldTrump bashing that Chris Wallace even chuckles - they all know that they are full of shit yet they persist, very telling. #FNS
@realDonaldTrump is robbing the piggy bank #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
https:// youtu.be/SDFMohR1y8g @SamHarrisOrg @RandomRantsofRy Imagine how the Sam Harris's of the world will freak out when @realDonaldTrump starts making arrests of the people he hangs with #PizzaGate #SethRich
@FoxNewsSunday Mr. Wallace you are soooo bias regarding @Potus that it pains me to even try to watch your coverage. If your guest says anything positive about @realDonaldTrump you go on to what ever you can use to give a negative. Not helpful at all in reporting news.
Hey... Didn't Barack Obama do that very same thing? Smile to @realDonaldTrump 's face and then do everything he could to go against him and subvert every move? Hmm ... #GlobalismWillKillUsAll
Can I be on your panel @FoxNewsSunday I know a heck of a lot more about what's going on with @realDonaldTrump and the World than any of your paid morons

@HuntsmanAbby probably needs to be more careful w/her comments. If @realDonaldTrump were a dictator, all of us would be in a world of hurt.
@realDonaldTrump is right: There should be 0 tariffs by any country. @SenJohnMcCain doesn't like Trump fighting who have been imposing tariffs and/or banning certain USA products for decades. Allies should be treating the USA as an ally. They and McCain are hypocrites.
@JustinTrudeau Build that wall Justin. Keep the wanker @realDonaldTrump out
After consulting with @AxlRamonesDaddy I think the only way to fix the relationship between the US and Canada is to have @BretHart wrestle @realDonaldTrump #trump #wwe #wrestlingdiplomacy

If #Fox can only get 52% of viewers to call in and support Don the Con's "economic policy" that translates into less than 3% of the country supports @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Canada - US relations is that of the mature parent & petulant child. What makes Canada a great country is our maturity to agree to disagree w/o sinking to denigrating - Trumps's admin. breaks new ground in American political trash "special place in hell"
@realDonaldTrump Mr President Trump we should not have to wait until are kids get locked up before we can teach them about God. We need are kids to know about Jesus not sex and drugs and the devil.
