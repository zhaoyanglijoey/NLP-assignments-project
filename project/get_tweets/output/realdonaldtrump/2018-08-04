Thanks for the contribution to the conversation, Alex. What does that say about you? Following more than one fool. I'm sure you follow @POTUS @realDonaldTrump .
Although i'm Canadian (and a massive #raptors fan)...with @realDonaldTrump comments about Lebron I feel obligated to say that Trump is incredibly ignorant...ESPECIALLY following what @KingJames just did with his new school for at risk youth. He deserves credit not unjust shade
You wanna know what my favorite part of Fox News is when they set up a question like a tee ball so close to his ass a 3 year old can hit it and yet @realDonaldTrump still fumbles the question and the host are just left watching with jaws dropped at his incompetence
Amazing help from the friends we still have left in this world thanks to the psychotic behavior of @realDonaldTrump .
. @realDonaldTrump finally addresses heat. "Even though it's 110 degrees in this crazy room ... if you can take it. I can take it. This room was not designed quite for this crowd, and you people are hot. So if anybody want to leave, leave."
Gotta call @realDonaldTrump something besides President?
No, I heard that... Funny, Jack Posobiec just got through with denouncing Q You're gonna love what's coming next. cc: #QAnon @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Did you know that President Obama is like 20 years younger than you? #ObamaDay
The pitch from @realDonaldTrump : @Troy_Balderson is smart and won't stop working, was his first pick in the primary.
"There is no path to 270, but there is a path to 304"! LMAO @realDonaldTrump is the Best! #Losers #ImpeachRosenstein #FAKENEWS #FakeRussiaCollusion @cnn @maddow @MSNBC @VanJones68 @donlemon

@realDonaldTrump Mika says you are unhinged, but I only saw you being America's biggest cheerleader which is what the main job of our President is suppose to be. I guess she forgot that since she hadn't seen that in many years.
@realDonaldTrump was and his wife had just had a baby when he fucked porn stars.
So True @realDonaldTrump . @FoxNews is the best!! Its on my television 95% of the time. The rest are fake news and won' t televise alll the good President Trump is doing. I have been on the Trump Train since the beginning. I knew he would be a great President since THE APPRENTICE
@realDonaldTrump Is possible for you to not insult someone, just for a day. Lebron James one of America's revered and respected athletes you debased and demeaned. Your reputation is more congruent with the "banality of evil, Satan" then a President of the United State.
man I sure wish it worked like that. For some reason @realDonaldTrump and team aren't broadcasting their itinerary like previous admins have done! Isn't the excite and wonder great!

Likelihood of @realDonaldTrump sniping at Obama when he notices all the love for his predecessor on #ObamaDay ? High. Extremely high.
@realDonaldTrump our duly elected @POTUS is correct calling out #FakeNews , not entire Press, just propoganda media daily not reporting good happening in by Administration & on top of it - bash Trump supporters. Reap what you sow . We should stop referring to them as MSM

So we should keep paying Russia tens of millions per astronaut, per ride (and be beholden to them for our space security as well) for using their RD-180s versus going to the private sector like ULA, SpaceEx, BlueOrigin?? @realDonaldTrump is doing a great job! Space Force! MAGA
Why are @CNN and @MSNBC not covering the @realDonaldTrump rally?
Why does the media still cover these @GOP rallies? They are giving @realDonaldTrump FREE advertising & a platform to spew his lies, hate filled speech, & abuse toward the media. #TrumpLies #TrumpConspired #TrumpRussia
