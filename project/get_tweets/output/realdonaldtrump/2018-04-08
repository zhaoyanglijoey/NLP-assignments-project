@realDonaldTrump "Capitalism" is great if the "GREED" (one of the "deadly-sins")-FACTOR is REMOVED. We know you are working-hard to do just that Mr. President....it takes time to "clear the swamp"....you'll suceed Mr. POTUS!!
The threat to make Russia pay a "high price" for something that Syria almost certainly did not do bespoke reckless idiocy. Hope it wasn't @realDonaldTrump . @AnnCoulter @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @CassandraRules
Hey Donald - are you getting worried that you're about to get exposed? @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels #TrumpFAIL #CompromisingPositions pic.twitter.com/Bt0dgJoQCY
@realDonaldTrump Airstrike Assad !
Kid, 30 years ago Gore called automobiles more dangerous to humanity than the nazis. My union, the UAW, proceeded to endorse him for president. Wrap your mind around that. And then thank God for @realDonaldTrump
America needs to stay out of middle east affairs. If Russia, Syria Iran etc want to kill each other, let them. We aren't the world police. @realDonaldTrump
Lol, Ed. @realDonaldTrump cant but see the world through his experiences. If he cheated ... So did the rest of the world... However, someone should tell him he's been in charge for 15 months now. Honeymoon is over. He needs to start taking responsibility right about NOW.
@WH @VP Dear @realDonaldTrump Death by cruise missile is just as awful as death by gas. So are the injuries. Don't kill to stop other killing....
"The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria, fix U.S.A." @realDonaldTrump 5 Sep 2013

@realDonaldTrump & admin. is also working hard to stop the high-paying corruption in our government & country, like drugs crossing border, human trafficking, pedophelia...
Waiting for @realDonaldTrump to settle his dispute with @StormyDaniels at #WrestleMania tonight...

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President: Did u watch tv tonight? (Hehe) If u didn't, u should check out the 60 Minute "Lampoon" segment. There's a very handsome picture of u sitting in a very nice old chair surrounded by a bunch of supporters. Hair looks great. Thumbs up--lots of them.
Is anybody else sick and tired of the QAnon posts at @realdonaldtrump and @POTUS ?

@realDonaldTrump Sean Hannity, who mocked Michelle Obama, says it's wrong to mock Melania Trump
Will @realDonaldTrump have a presidential library since he can't read? #spankyspaperbacks #vintageplayboymags
Just able to get back into twitter seems someone doesn't Luke my comments or post in support of our wonderful President @realDonaldTrump
@GitRDoneLarry @BTLSRadio @realDonaldTrump I got some new #GeorgeJones underwear they say "The race is on" black letters across the back I'd like to have some locker room talk about them #HotTalks
So mocking @FLOTUS is getting you a lot more flack than #Dufus45 mocking a disabled journalist. I guess that shows just how much bull the average @realDonaldTrump follower will swallow as long as they are being fed it by the #OrangeIdiot himself.

@realDonaldTrump You probably paid someone to burn it down for the insurance money, but being a jobber like you he failed.
How discusting @SenJohnMcCain - just give it up. Did @realDonaldTrump also embolden #NorthKorea ?? because they are NOW talking nuclear disarmament. RINOs need to go, #DrainTheSwamp #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Trump has filled the Swamp his Swamp full of Criminals and Billionaires - Shameful what crap you are presenting Impeach @realDonaldTrump
I agree, it could be expensive for a poor or middle class person. But not for @realDonaldTrump who claims to be a billionaire.
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump has apologized to his wife for fucking a porn star, and then paying her to keep quiet?

@realDonaldTrump That ain't isn't a word has recently come to my attention in calling a Seminole Indian fellow named Mike. I'm attempting to stay away from evil feathered hairdos. That is the Broward Sheriffs Office problem, or at least they want it to be there problem.
When exactly will @realDonaldTrump stop blaming previous administrations for all the shit he promised he would fix on day one?
We have seen the power of Twitter. The more we follow each other, the more we can learn AND the MORE WE CAN SPREAD THE WORD! Im not here for popularity or RT stats, Im here to scream at the top of my lungs the @realDonaldTrump is a liar, a criminal, is unqualified and an idiot
@realDonaldTrump I don't fully trust Mad Dog because he was seriously recruited by the never-trumpers to defeat you. But, his infidelity to his wife seemed to prevent him from challenging you..Second guess your intell.
Today @TheJuanWilliams told Chris Wallace in Fox News Sunday, that @realDonaldTrump was trying to pull troops out of Syria without Pentagon approval. I have new for you Juan, POTUS doesn't need approval from the Pentagon. He's the Commander In Chief. The Pentagon works for him!!!

Dear @realDonaldTrump @GenJohnKelly @GenFlynn @StephenMillerAL There are thousands of Former Military/Contractors (myself included) that would be happy to offer our services to the Qffice for God, and Country. GodSpeed
I am convinced @realDonaldTrump plans to hold presidential power for 2 terms--and beyond--regardless of investigations, elections or impeachment using his state TV, his base and disregard of laws and norms.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, U R about to see ANOTHER long standing retail company, BON-TON, FAIL this week. RETAIL stores R FAILING all across the country. Do U realize HOW MANY JOBS this is? 100 year stores/malls R all dying. Plus thousands of JOBS.

With these type of tweets you show two things:1) projection of your inner most feared faults and 2) your lack of ability to think except in the most superficial manner ...Want to grow & see more? We'll gladly give you @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain ticket. Is really glorious!
@realDonaldTrump So. Let's see if we understand this correctly. The Trump Tower fire is the 2nd blaze in your "well built" sprinkler-free residential building, eh? And in the late 90s you lobbied against sprinklers in buildings. Excellent. ....
Fake News by @realDonaldTrump about #SyriaChemicalAttack , pic.twitter.com/3uHibLlmhW
Trump fought fire legislation and refused to install sprinklers on residential floors of Trump Tower https://www. rawstory.com/?p=1251149 via rawstory . @realDonaldTrump . @IvankaTrump Appalling disregard for human life. Hope everyone sues you for the cheap, ignorant slumlords you are.
That because our POTUS has balls. Something Obama definitely lacked. Keep making America Great Again @realDonaldTrump !! We finally have a president we can be proud of.

. @MichaelCohen212 is enough of a thin-skinned crybaby that he even threatens @harvardlampoon staff over @realDonaldTrump getting harmlessly pranked. Get over yourself, Michael! #60Minutes
@realDonaldTrump .....so what if someone dies, and firefighters get injured? What's a dead body here or there? What's it to you? The important thing is --- you saved money. Btw, hope you DID save money. You'll need it for the crippling lawsuits coming your way.
@realDonaldTrump Respectfully Commander in Chief, how do you fire a true Patriot H.R. McMaster and you praise an elitist Capitalism like Scott Pruitt? Pruitt is the swamp you promised to drain. He lives off our tax dollars. Pruitt needs to go.
Something shady going on when @realDonaldTrump says he want to leave Syria, then attack happens, and the media seems to want him to stay and send more troops! #LetsInvestigateThisTime
@realDonaldTrump Mr.President please do not talk to Mueller
Assad is defending his country from foreign fighters and since @realDonaldTrump has declared US is pulling out of Syria, neither Assad nor Russia has anything to gain from more bombing. Israel and the Saudis have a lot more to gain.
@realDonaldTrump Justice to be a strike on the head of the tyrant Bashar
You realize this tweet could apply to @realDonaldTrump He is attacking his political enemies daily. See his latest tweets today. He would have them all put in jail to distract from his own culpability.
more fake news from the fake news master @realDonaldTrump ! As he says so often - Making America Fake is Great
@realDonaldTrump I don't want another war, but you do need to respond to Syria. You drew the line last time if he used chemical weapons were used again...they were used...time to follow through. I trust you and know you have to back your word.
Just found out my 14 year-old daughter got blocked by @realDonaldTrump on Instagram. It took her making fun of his hair on 52 separate posts. I have a new hero. #BlockedByTrump
@realDonaldTrump @VP @AmbJohnBolton President Trump should never just drag on the matter of the demoniac North Korea till next May. Strike North Korea in essential part and exterminate Kim Jong Un mmediately. Destroy all of the Korean Peninsula, so that all those commies die.
