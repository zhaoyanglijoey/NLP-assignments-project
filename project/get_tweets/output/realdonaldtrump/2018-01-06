Watched a few Seinfelds and a couple of #ComediansInCarsGettingCoffee today, yet still nothing has made me laugh more than @realDonaldTrump on twitter today. #POTUSVSG
I wonder what @realDonaldTrump 's thoughts are on cryptocurrency? I don't remember ever hearing him mention Bitcoin, Ether, etc.... He's got a businessman's perspective, so I'd be curious to get his take on cryptos. Or @DonaldJTrumpJr also! pic.twitter.com/BVvTlWi9kF
dumber than @realDonaldTrump , you definitely are
@realDonaldTrump You okay Hun?
He went to #TrumpUniversity no wonder he so smart lol @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPLeader @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @RWPUSA @SenJeffMerkley @SallyQYates @SenWarren @maddow @Lawrence @Acosta @chelseahandler @RepAdamSchiff @CNN
. @FoxNews does a dis-service to its audience by actually bending the truth and in cases lying and promoting false facts by @realDonaldTrump . The only reason they go above and Beyond to is less #45 is purely for PROFITS and viewership @cnn @MSNBC @seanhannity
@realDonaldTrump fears the truth because it shows how useless, worthless, stupid and treasonous he is. So, he lies constantly to try and create a different reality. Those of us NOT wearing tin foil hats understand the truth.
@realDonaldTrump Release your tanscripts. You demanded Obama's. Set an example.
@realDonaldTrump does not know de whey.

Nope, @realDonaldTrump and the @HouseGOP and the @SenateGOP @GOP are the Liars & Phonies. Fire and Fury is a true book.
The only way @realDonaldTrump could be deemed "Stable" is if a horse kicked him in the face and ate his hay bale of a toupee.
Show of hands: your choice is between a second administration for @realDonaldTrump or singing "God Save the Queen" and bending a knee as part of the Commonwealth. Which do you choose?
OMG can't be.. @realDonaldTrump tell a lie?!!!..he never goes back on promises! Remember when he said he would not touch Medicare or Social Security! Remember when he said he established such good lasting relationships with the countries he visited on his first official trip!
Riley, mental deficiencies - people who after 1 year refuse to acknowledge @realDonaldTrump as @POTUS . Stock market is at all time high, lowest unemployment of Americans of African decent ever, people getting off food stamps, tax structure changed ... I will pick this any day.

@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GovMikeHuckabee
@realDonaldTrump The jackass wants $18 billion for the freaking wall but CHIP is still unfunded.
What if @GOP members or leadership are complicit in Russia voting activities and/or coverup? That would be another reason to cover for @realDonaldTrump . Maybe they don't Mueller to discover the role of others not in the Administration.
It would be "very helpful" if the U.S. had stronger slander laws as well. @realDonaldTrump would have never been permitted to run for office.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS pic.twitter.com/K6Vkzrdxhr
Sickening hypocrisy. Not only did @realDonaldTrump call 'many sides' "really fine people" but he also said, (while knowing that Donny was out of his element) "My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.. No thanks.
I think he takes some kind of drug at times, probably an anti-anxiety and then loses what little word abilities he has. He is so #UnfitForOffice @realDonaldTrump
Please do the thing that would be, like, really smart and RESIGN! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
We Canadians love the daily stupidity that keeps coming out of the White House. Keep the laughs coming @realDonaldTrump
Part of the problem is @realDonaldTrump thousands of lies. Much of the book has a truthiness to it & rings true. Had Trump not been such a liar this book would be seen in the same light as Clinton's Cash...oh wait never mind.
Working on my book "Hooks, Slices, Duck!" that proves @realDonaldTrump sucks at golf.
@SenSanders the people DO want the wall. It's the reason @realDonaldTrump was elected President and you weren't! #security #BuildTheWall #MAGA #Trump #TrumpTrain #winning #areyousickofwinningyet
@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President. Please keep marijuana legal for the sake of our veterans with PTSD, opioid addicts, vaccine injured kids and all other medical marijuana patients. The war on drugs is a war on us and can never be won. #honorstatesrights , #endthedrugwar

The only laws ur interested in are the ones that benefit u and ur family. And if ur so interested in those laws perhaps you should be sued for the birthed rumor that slandered Obamas name by stating he wasn't born in the US and that u had prove you LIAR! @realDonaldTrump
@Kris_Sacrebleu So why did so many of them vote for @realDonaldTrump and will they ever admit they made a mistake?
@realDonaldTrump needs to move to the UK where he will find the libel laws more to his liking. If they will let him in.

Hahahaha @potus @realdonaldtrump , in a single tweet, provided fodder for comedians for decades! @AlecBaldwin your phone is ringing
The most wasteful President of all time. He put America into a big hole but he also made it really easy for @realDonaldTrump to show improvement. We've got a long way to go but there's finally hope that we can spiral in the other direction.

I'm mad fwm @POTUS @realDonaldTrump

I foretell a mammoth twitterstorm as @realDonaldTrump attempts to outsource the deck chair arrangements on the Titanic.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sure, you're a genius and your dick is huge, and women love it when you assault them, and your tax returns prove your wealth. Fool your rube base, not the rest of us. #thenub secret service code name. #citruspuppet
There's only one way to confirm @realDonaldTrump is a #genius : #Jeopardy ... #POTUS v. Anyone.
What fkng triumphs? There are no triumphs to ignore. What's being ignore is your reporting on @realDonaldTrump s fkng mental state, his paranoia, his growing dementia, possible no-polar disease. Of course that's expected from #TrumpStateNews .
@realDonaldTrump NEWSFLASH you are a laughing stock around the world.
It would be helpful if @realDonaldTrump were arrested immediately, tried, convicted and put behind bars as soon as humanly possible.

@realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @SheriffClarke @RealJamesWoods @JulianAssange @PrisonPlanet
Why should @realDonaldTrump show up to an event where you will disrespect and slander him? It is not his fault spoiled celebrities backed an unlikeable, corrupt candidate, touting failed policies and the American people rejected her.
@realDonaldTrump then everyone that you've insulted could file a lawsuit against you right?

@realDonaldTrump The MSM and ignorant liberals trying to drive President Trump from office, only thing They're driving is each other batty as hell, and doing a fine job of it.
@realDonaldTrump wants 18 billion dollars of taxpayer money for his stupid wall! TAXPAYER MONEY FOR A STUPID WALL while making deep cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, & Social Security! HELL WITH THE ELDERLY THEIR ALMOST DEAD ANYWAY! LETS BUILD THAT WALL INSTEAD OF TAKING CARE OF THEM!
Know that I stand with you, @drmikemurdock and @realDonaldTrump . The devil has a meltdown when these men of God wake up in the morning.

My 10-year old sniffed out the ridiculousness of calling yourself a genius to the whole country @realDonaldTrump
Razzie Award Winning Actor @realDonaldTrump is a #stablegenius . Then again, @theresa_may claimed to be strong and STABLE like someone who never actually met a human person, and it's harder to agitate a souffle, so what does that tell us? Narcissistic, delusional twatwaffle.

Bragging that @realDonaldTrump will not be President.
@realDonaldTrump No it wouldn't be very helpful if the US had stronger libel laws.Only tyrants, despots, & authoritarians silence the written word. However it would be helpful for you to act with dignity. If you can't stand the heat in the oval office, get out of the White House.
@SenToomey in light of your legislative advocacy related to North Korea, do you have anything to say about @realDonaldTrump 's incendiary tweets and their effect on our nation's attempts to deal with a nuclear North Korea? Or will you maintain your habit of cowardly silence?
@realDonaldTrump claims Fire and Fury is false, but still mercilessly attacks Bannon on Twitter... so is "Mr. like, really smart" attacking Bannon for no reason then?

Declaring yourself "a very stable genius" is declaring your instability. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you said "And, in theory, everybody tells me I'm not under investigation." What does that mean? Do people say to you, "Mr. President theoretically you are not under investigation. But realistically you are."
@realDonaldTrump tell me Boy, what type of visa did Taylor Wilson have? I ask you on the basis of your promoting to the nation that terrorist come from abroad.

The more @CNN attacks @realDonaldTrump the more they'll get a reverse or rather an opposite reaction (reverse psychology) from the public especially his loyal supporters. @AC360 @CNNTonight I'm not saying this as a supporter but as an observer
