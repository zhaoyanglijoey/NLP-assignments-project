@realDonaldTrump What if we put a gun in every classroom, but in a lockbox controlled by the teachers fingerprints that would only ever be opened if a shooter was in the school.
let's fix that logic. It fund OC because it is illegal, alcohol would do the same. And twitter can do alot. Just ask your NATO drugs taskforce partners command-in-chief @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump Fun watching globalist rino hacks at FOX attack your tariff policies. I am sure your tariffs will be reciprocally adjusted country by country. Besides, our steel is far superior to the junk others have dumped on us for decades.
I though @realDonaldTrump was ale Grand Orange. Hmmm
@espn should be banned from TV if this story comes out as fake news. Costing our program all of next year now with commits gone. @realDonaldTrump #MSGA #MakeSportcenterGreatAgain
@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy @BillCassidy @RepGarretGraves : How is this even possible to come up for a vote. Repub campaigned ending the funding for PP, but here we are still using taxpayer money to murder babies and buy ads targeting conservatives. Is pelosie the Speaker?
Clairvoyance.............is that french for he got a call from @realDonaldTrump ?

It is clear that @realDonaldTrump , his family, and his friends are crooks of the highest order. The whole world is wondering....how much longer will American citizens let this go on.
Angry and unglued is an everyday experience at @WhiteHouse with crime boss @realDonaldTrump and cronies
@realDonaldTrump I told you so. Flush w/ cash from the tax cut companies are heading for a "stock buyback binge of historic proportions."C-suites view the cut not as a green light to invest and build for the long haul, but as manna fr heaven to pump their faltering share prices
did you know @realDonaldTrump @POTUS and others worldwide who want to cut government spending actually want to shut down crucial infrastructure humans might use to survive government and corporate attacks, slow killing Americans with targeting & gutted legal and welfare system
@realDonaldTrump #sphincter
The journalists who have come to know to much have been killed + gone missing. We are talking about global crime and money laundering in the billions and billions. @realDonaldTrump thought he could just get in on it. But the evidence will come out and hopefully we learn the truth
@realDonaldTrump is clueless about economics & pretty much everything else except money laundering & treason
@realDonaldTrump Homeland Security began after 911 so every agency could relate to each other. We need another type of Homeland Security. These agencies need a data base...social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, police, court orders, criminal records..
Mr @realDonaldTrump you need @ICEgov to go to all the California @DelMarRacing and the @losalracing ever one of the tracks in California has illegals working on all the Back Side of the Tracks
Trump has no clue what he supports. Were you the last person to speak to him? Then whatever you're for, he's for. The flim flam man is so transparent, aren't you @realDonaldTrump
With #TaxCutsForAmerica @realDonaldTrump gave us i received a substantial bonus. Which helped my family of 5 tremendously. #freedom #FridayFeeling #MAGA God bless you Mr. President
@realDonaldTrump you must stand strong on gun control we have laws on the books enforce them why should an 18 year old de able to die for our country but not buy a gun. so unfair do not take my guns
@realDonaldTrump express scripts for generic medication was free. now going up to $14 dollars each. I need 11. I make $1300 a month before house payment, and all bills. thanks for the SCREW RICH MAN. THIS FROM MY PARTY. I AM A VETERAN. PLUS AFGHANISTAN.

We have been under a trade war for decades. It's about time we got a @POTUS that is willing to recognize it and reverse it. These other nations don't like it because they have been benefiting for decades. Go get them @realDonaldTrump deplorables are with you! #MAGA
Congress passes sanctions on Russia, no action from Trump. Russian troops attack and kill American soldiers, no actions from Trump. Russia launches rocket claiming America can't intercept it, no action from Trump. The Pee tape must be real @realDonaldTrump

Nobody turned on @realDonaldTrump . He just plays you guys like a fiddle. Try to catch on before you fall behind.....
But @realDonaldTrump 's only plan is to abuse infrastructure to reward his crooked developer friends w/no bid contracts. No infrastructure gets fixed. Govt is overbilled. Oligarchs get richer. Honey stick to what u know best: shopping w/profits from ur sweatshops. #SweatShopQueen
@realDonaldTrump So you've decided to go into a Trade War with the World. Nice. I love your AGENDA. Lower the Corporate Tax Rate in America for THE RICH. Raise taxes on everyone else. Raise Tariff charges, stick the bill to American workers. It's ok you still have your tax cut.
What's your point? If Obama didn't get anything done to keep kids from being shot up in their schools then 45 shouldn't bother? What an asinine line of thinking. Oh and side note, one of the things Obama did do, @realDonaldTrump reversed.
Hatch is right there with @realDonaldTrump for respecting the American people.
@realDonaldTrump If you could of replaced the obamacare you would have scored a Grand Slam Home run. But that is not on you but on the RINOs. We also need you to federally legalize Cannabis.

@realDonaldTrump time to let Vlad know you will not let him push America around ! Stand up like a man !
Thought for the day: If @realDonaldTrump is placed under arrest, and the court grants a defense motion for House Arrest as opposed to detention, does the president have to move to a different house?
Boy they can get him to do anything they want. #foxandfriendspuppet #putinpuppet #treason #corrupt @realDonaldTrump #draftdodger
@realDonaldTrump Can you give us one good reason you backed out of getting tough with the NRA? The only thing that will keep assault weapons from killing people, is having no assault weapons. People pull the trigger but they can't pull one if they don't have one.

@realDonaldTrump is living proof that wealthy/business execs, and or folks with inherited wealth aren't the leaders capitalistic ideology claims; you aren't a leader if it's your money making things happen.. @POTUS44 was a leader; grassroots, scuffed shoes and all.

@realDonaldTrump , someone who is in as desperate financial trouble as @jaredkushner should not be in a position of power. It is too dangerous. He is desperate to refinance 666 Fifth Avenue, which has a $1.2 billion balloon payment coming due early next year.

Every damn thing about @realDonaldTrump and this illegal administration IS a conflict of interest. This bs would not have continued 10 or even 15 yrs ago-they'd all be gone by now.
@realDonaldTrump I am a gun owner and support the second amendment, but please do not cave to the NRA a 18 cannot but alcohol in the USA then why can they buy a gun. I get the fact the can join the military at 18 and use all kinds of weapons, but that is with training.
@realDonaldTrump is pushing the dems to the far left & they're happily clustering there. The rest of America is slowly awakening to the brainwashing they'd been fed by the #fakenews folks and the socialists/progressives preening and virtue-signaling. They're busted now tho. #MAGA
. @realDonaldTrump thinks people are forced to watch SNL. By whom?
