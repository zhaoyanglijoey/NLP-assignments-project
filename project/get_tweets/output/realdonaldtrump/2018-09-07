#plaidshirtguy just started a new #Resistence movement. I wonder if he works for @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Hey everybody, wasn't it great 2 hear a genuine PRESIDENT of the United States Barrack Obama give a speech of UNITY! Unlike the IDIOT placed in the WH by the RUSSIANS Donald Trump. Barrack is a president whose eloquence and communication skills are sorely missed
What happened to you?? Who'd you sleep with? Who did you defraud? There is no other explanation for this. You called @realDonaldTrump every name in the book when he was running. What happened Lindsey. John McCain is rolling in his grave.
@realdonaldtrump goes more insane over a little water cooler talk.
. @realDonaldTrump A scam is what you are. Not legally in the White House. Breaking laws daily, 5 lawsuits against you not countingvthe Russia probe. You are nothing but a con man.
That they didn't want to be racist & misogynist like you. @realDonaldTrump 's lies, deflection and obfuscation go on and on. Mud washes off: #Collusion is forever! #CadetBoneSpurs #LiarInChief #IllegitimatePresident pic.twitter.com/V2L0eSkqng
That's Jeff Sessions' non-politically influenced @FBI & @TheJusticeDept .. don't know in what world JS in living, but it's not the real one. @realDonaldTrump

The whole @GOP is taking bullsh---ing lessons from @RealDonaldTrump .
Proof that America has a serious DRUG PROBLEM this man is high as a kite @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@realDonaldTrump & getting that large conference table is not disqualifying. You want an American made table & quality conference & meeting tables are always expensive. & it's worth it to get a nice one that lasts & looks worthy of the US.
Again a reminder: In the last 4 years of @BarackObama , an average of 213 K jobs/mo were added; in the 1st 18 mo of @realDonaldTrump , 190 K jobs/mo added. Under BO, S&P up average of 30.3/mo; under DT, that average is 30/mo.

@realDonaldTrump Obama is back next Obama mama will be back
I hope @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski have grasped the import of what approving this mendacious @realDonaldTrump joke of a nominee would mean to the USA. #BrettKavanaugh has perjured himself a number or simply refused to answer important questions. #VoteNoOnKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/akjfvQF8fY
When @realDonaldTrump appointed @jeffsessions it was a dark day for the @TheJusticeDept . Donald, Barack Obama and Pete Brown were committed to their attack and Jeff Sessions comes in and kicks out Obama back in March of 2017.
So true, Patriot. May God Continue to Bless & Protect Our Greatest President, #POTUS45 ! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #KeepPOTUS45InOurPrayers #MAGA #WWG1WGA #Q #QAnon #QArmy
This is a great clip ! The video that I saw not only was he replaced by some woman the couple next to him was also replaced. This is what happens when he don't show enough enthusiasm to @realDonaldTrump
This is @realDonaldTrump next speech: was not "pecific" about all his great best knows a lot of great "bigly" speeches not like the "anomamynus" gutless who needs to be paraded naked and stoned.
Really? Facts: Jobs grew from Nov 2012 to Nov 2016 at 1.88 % a year during @BarackObama 2nd term Jobs grew from November 2016 to today by 1.57 % since @realDonaldTrump elected Do the math Judi...if you can!
Obama had the misfortune of inheriting an economy that was severely depressed from the actions of the previous GOP administration. @realDonaldTrump is inheriting the economy AFTER the Obmana recovery.
OK now Trump Organization. @realDonaldTrump You better start with the Hillary and her cronies. Wake up !
Lard Ass @realDonaldTrump claims that he slept during "President Obama" 's speech today. Guess who didn't sleep? pic.twitter.com/v9a7tA2Jyh
Obozo should be in Prison and hopefully will be soon. A lot of evidence piling up he @BarackObama new about the spying on @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you both will inspire ppl.Ticket will be stronger.The pressure can be taken off you. & Carson is a good man to you. He's a rare gem. & he will be truly a loyal VP & smart! Pence may be loyal or try to be but not sharpest.
@realDonaldTrump Trump said that he fell asleep during Obama speech.. I think it was just the frustration of having to "Google" the words!
@realDonaldTrump you are a good president
@realDonaldTrump said he slept during Obama speech. Obama should speak more often.Solution for every problem.
@realDonaldTrump Hey dickhead! So, remembering back a few years, YOU were the one who said that "an anonymous source" told you that @BarackObama 's birth certificate was fake. Now, YOU are pissed as Hell because "an anonymous source" told the TRUTH about you??? pic.twitter.com/2FjjHPZ0XS

@realDonaldTrump Get history correct. Unknown where Lincoln wrote Gettysburg address. Theory is he wrote it on back of envelope on a train. The media completely ignored the speech.

We must come together. We will outlive this president. We will erase his name from the history books. He will be a stain that we shun from our vocabulary forever. @realDonaldTrump we will teach our children exactly who Donald Trump was. And why he failed. pic.twitter.com/fD43Sv37n6

Well @realDonaldTrump . So much for walking the walk.
Congratulations to @BarackObama on winning the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government. Hey @realDonaldTrump , you'll never win anything as impressive .
@realDonaldTrump Things are good because of you, pause & take a brake after the Dakotas! We the People Thank you for all that you do! But you must take care of yourself in order to do anything! Please, OK!
So ironic that @barackobama the most anti semitic president is calling out @realdonaldtrump the most Pro Israel president #ObamaLies #antisemite #MidtermDistractions #DumpTheDems

I willing to bet $$$ that @nytimes will last a helluva lot longer than @realDonaldTrump #Conman #ManChild #45MustGo #FTrump
Pennies compared to how much @realDonaldTrump is spending to play golf at his own resort! In case you haven't figured it out, that means Trump is profiting from the tax payers...
@BarackObama You have fuck all to do with what @realDonaldTrump has done nothing , he is a far superior man than you or you're husband Michael will ever be!
Great conversation with Tammy and David. Difference between @realDonaldTrump and Obama, results vs talk. #StillWinning
Can we all just #cyberbully @realDonaldTrump until he quits twitter? (And even better, quits @potus )
@realDonaldTrump I have said it for 2 years - find a good doctor and go- u don't look or sound well- your having trouble pronouncing words-look at yourself - you look sick - find a GOOD doctor
Only in 2018 would we attack a billionaire @elonmusk that is trying to save the world with technology and promote the billionaire that wants to divide everyone @realDonaldTrump It's like batman has been replaced with the joker in America.
Watch OBAMA speech via YOUTUBE! Wow-so great to hear a president who didn't make it about himself & spoke with HONESTY, COMPASSION & TRUTH & who can complete sentences! Unlike @realDonaldTrump who spreads fear, conspiracies, hatred & lies & ALL ABOUT HIMSELF! #25Amendment #WTF

Truly, @elonmusk is the @realDonaldTrump of Silicon Valley -- random, excessive attack on @guardian , the weird insistence that the one diver who rescued the Thai soccer team is a pedophile. Do you suppose he has people he's fucked over sign unenforceable NDAs?
There are only twelve Vines in existence and people just keep repackaging them for YouTube. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Heard you claimed you "fell asleep" during President Obama's speech...no surprise. President Obama uses intelligent and adult words which likely go sailing over your head. What happened....were your translators sleeping also?
@realDonaldTrump Have you considered General Kelly could be the #Lodestar ? Ask @VP Mike Pence, he would know a #Traitor when he sees one. (In the mirror)
. @RealDonaldTrump , wants @TheJusticeDept to investigate 'real crimes' like ... an 'unfair op-ed'. Not crimes like Conspiracy against the USA, perjury, obstruction of justice, money laundering, fraud, grifting, sexual assault ...
Hey, Donnie @realDonaldTrump . Do you lie awake at night worried that the walls are closing in? Consider this: Resign while blaming the deep state. Reputation saved while possibly stopping further inquiry. "Those damn lefties. They prevented a golden age."

Unlike @realDonaldTrump , James never has to artificially inflate his crowd size.

@realDonaldTrump save the government some money and outsource USPS services to Fedex or UPS since the USPS chooses not to deliver our mail or packages. They are losing $$ yearly. Ups and Fedex loves to deliver my packages
He could just be a drunk. @realDonaldTrump lies about everything else. Why not that?
Michael Moore everybody must see this movie. Then go out and vote. @realDonaldTrump Trump wishes he was a dictator. He wants to be like Kim Jong-un. But he will never be revered. He will be Hated.

@realdonaldtrump Sir, you do not respect the flag, the National Anthem, the Country, or the Constitution....
@realdonaldtrump the president's job is, in part, to keep the government functioning properly, not to shut it down for his/her own political advantage or malignant toddler tantrums. If you can't abide by that simple standard, then feel free to STEP DOWN.

@realDonaldTrump 1. Is a co conspirator to a crime 2. Trying to keep kids in detention indefinitely 3. Cant pronounce anonymous 4. This list could go on for awhile
Two issues here: 1) 'Former' as in the Obama regime's DOJ employees? Yep, that's laughable right there. and 2) You are 'demanding' things from President @realDonaldTrump 's Republican Congress? Don't you get it? Your party lost. They are not there any more. Go pound sand!
