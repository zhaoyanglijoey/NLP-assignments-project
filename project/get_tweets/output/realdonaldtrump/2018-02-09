Dear @maddow is @TomBarrackJr is the gentleman in charge of @realDonaldTrump minuscule inauguration with no accountability for $107M? He is being considered to replace the disgraced @GenJohnKelly . This should be a good topic for your unbelievably exciting show.
I believe after this comment , the next phrase is @realDonaldTrump why is use a racist! pic.twitter.com/qE7EEDUbg6

@realDonaldTrump 1892 on 2/9/18....Brilliant. Stay safe sir. See you APRIL 7 for the Peaceful Patriot March. We the people want justice. MAGA. #LOCKTHEMUP
AGREED @realDonaldTrump
Being a part of the @realDonaldTrump administration did that for him a long time ago.
@realDonaldTrump Best wishes for a violent abuser, but not a word for the abused? You are an absolute disgrace to this nation. #FakePOTUS
You should be more clear that there would not have been enough probable cause to suspect @realDonaldTrump . This memo does show false accusations
#MAGA (Making Assault Great Again) @realDonaldTrump
Man Jessica , innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Fox needs democrats with at least common sense oh wait there are none. @realDonaldTrump @StephenMilIer @DineshDSouza
@realDonaldTrump Please Keep Kelly!!!! He's the best staff person in the WH and he loves this country and is loyal to it
Lemme get this straight ... if you are on team @realDonaldTrump then being a wife beater, or racist, or isolationist, or liar, or hypocrite, or pig, or all of them combined .... you're all good as long as you deny it ... but damn if you're an immigrant - GET OUT .. GOT IT #Trump

Anyways, my only happiness is that while United States helped gave us this clueless/blood thirsty vampire, God gave them an equally clueless man as a President. @realDonaldTrump is an unrepentant fool nd it suits them just right...God willing 2019 Buhari must go will be a rality.
Thanks for going over there and being as classless as possible. You represent us all while you're there....not just your daddy @realDonaldTrump .
It makes no bigly difference. With the microwave in the Oval Office, both Putin and @realDonaldTrump are briefed simultaneously.
. @realDonaldTrump is they aliens?
And The Donald only hires the best. Hiring a serial killer next @realDonaldTrump ?
And just where is the #DemocraticMemo - afraid of something, @realDonaldTrump ?!
EXACTLY! Hell, DNA evidence exonerating black dudes of raping a white woman isn't enough for @realDonaldTrump to back off; but white dude #RobPorter or #RoyMoore saying he didn't do it is THE threshold for reasonable doubt.
It is not the parade itself that is unusual. It is the #FakePOTUS @realDonaldTrump who is ordering it that causes many to question whether or not it is appropriate. trump is the epitome of inappropriate.

RT #ReleaseTheDemMemo if not released it proves it shows the Nunes memo was only to cover up @realDonaldTrump 's wrong doing, it proves that trump has so much to hide.
If all media outlets are determined to take @realDonaldTrump down.. Shouldn't it be fairly obvious that he might doing something right?
NIGERIAN TEXAN BOB SLED TEAM COMPETING FOR THE UNITED STATES? HAS @realDonaldTrump VETTED THEM YET!? @KRAUTENDALEK #OpeningCeremony #2018Olympics

One important thing to remember This bill that cleared Congress with spending that is seen as profligate by conservatives would not have passed had @GOPSenate had 60 seats together with the @HouseGOP majority Elect GOP Senators in 2018 Mid-terms @realDonaldTrump @VP @WSJ @FoxNews

@realDonaldTrump please don't let the liberal media win. Don't let Chief of Staff Kelley leave.
@FoxNews @FoxBusiness @cnn @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews agreed what is it with the media, reporters and the Dems operatives they want to get rid of the generals surrounding POTUS! Especially Kelly why do you think IS!? use your imagination and history!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Do not fire Kelly, the left wing media is after every employ you have because they can't get you and someone's personal life is their business after all Hillary kept on her faith adviser after he haressed women
@realDonaldTrump #CadetBoneSpurs you have no right putting on any type of military garb. You didn't serve your country then, you aren't serving it now. All you are doing is feeding your fat ugly ego and filling your pockets at the expense of real heroes & hard working Americans.
@realDonaldTrump Where's the memo? I know it's 10 whole pages, but someone should have had time to read it to you by now! Time's UP!
What will my Twitter feed look like when @realDonaldTrump is no longer President? I need to find new people follow. #Resistance #ImpeachTrump
Let's remember that FEMA was pulling out of Puerto Rico until there was public uproar and they had to reverse course. No money to help Americans in PR who were devastated by a natural disaster but plenty to celebrate our #NationalDisaster @realdonaldtRump

@realDonaldTrump So, Rob Porter & Roy Moore both denied their charges but U also denied the assault charges against you & we all know you were lying. U of all people should believe their accusers because U know FOR SURE yours were telling the truth, too.
Sadly according to @realDonaldTrump if you deny it, it's ok.
Been saying.....Sessions was a Trojan horse to get inside @realDonaldTrump camp and work stealthily against him.

@realDonaldTrump Are the words too hard in the daily briefing?
@realDonaldTrump 's @WhiteHouse needs always a beater.
I wouldn't trust the Trump documents further than I could throw @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Does Lyons have a security clearance?

@realDonaldTrump admin didn't like her answer when asked if she would fire Mueller if it came down to her, so they made her an offer she can't refuse; clearing the way to fire Rosenstein, and moving up a Trump loyalist to end the Russia Investigation.

@realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner @DonaldJTrumpJr America LOVES General John Kelly, a true American hero and the greatest Chief of Staff at all times. The incessant MSM attacks on the WH are historic. Stand tall. Ignore them & MAGA. We love General Kelly & POTUS. God bless you both.

It's well documented and still worth pointing out that @realDonaldTrump considered Roy Cohn a mentor. That guy was a serious piece of shit. And he mentored one.
Yes fall out will come to @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr .

We don't want your stinkin' letter, @realDonaldTrump . #ReleaseTheDemMemo , or its just more obstruction of justice.
@realDonaldTrump your tweets age better than you have.
This whole narrative being used against the American people that says @realDonaldTrump is "attacking" the @TheJusticeDept is childish, a pack of lies, and obviously another weak attempt to discredit President Trump so the deepstate criminals can stay in power not prison.
@realDonaldTrump emRACISM...
@TGowdySC said that there is reason to investigate Russian meddling in 16 election but he also said there is no probable cause or evidence to suspect @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GOP Why do you care so much for accused abusers & have no concerns for victims? Oh right, because you are proud of your own sexual assault.
@realDonaldTrump please keep Kelley. He is a msn of integrity and good at his job! This too shall come to pass#whitehouse#trumpstaff
