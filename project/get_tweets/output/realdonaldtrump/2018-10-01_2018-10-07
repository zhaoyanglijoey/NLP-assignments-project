@realDonaldTrump nice job remembering the Las Vegas massacre today too
Cowards don't fight, they get others to do it for them or they do it by insidious means. I could cough that cowardly @realDonaldTrump down and I am only 4'10.5" tall, weigh 7st and I am a 'girly'!!!! How embarrassing for him. One of these and he would be down
He's Lying!!! @PhilosophySeel Desperation like @realDonaldTrump ! It's called she's ignoring you because you don't matter!!!!
Bernie why should we care about America anymore if it is about to become a terrible place again with @realDonaldTrump selling us out to every short of the liquor lobby? What is going to be left that is good? We are never going to face the issue with people like this leading them
All the con man @realDonaldTrump did was change the acronym (Somebody tell him what that means) because he feels so inferior to our best president ever @POTUS44

@ABCWorldNews Just despicable to see the president disrespect @CeciliaVega at the press conference today. What a rude SOB @realDonaldTrump is. No class whatsoever. Pathetic.
Once again the Trumps celebrate the end of a drama cycle totally of their own making. So we have a slightly altered NAFTA that only includes provisions that would have been introduced with TPP and @realDonaldTrump celebrates it as a success. All he did was create chaos.

In deep-red Tennessee, @realDonaldTrump tells his ardent supporters that Democrats will "flood your streets with criminal aliens," echoing the fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric that fueled his victory in 2016. But will it help the @GOP defend the House in November?
@realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley demand the FBI get a copy of Dr. Ford's high school yearbook and that they talk her boyfriend who said she stalked him and also look into her current billion dollar pharma employer
I stand with you @CeciliaVega . Stand up to that bullying slob @realDonaldTrump
So you think using taxpayer dollars to help one party over the other is a Constitutional use of taxpayer dollars? Because it's not. The government isn't allowed to play favorites, though @realDonaldTrump doesn't seem to understand that ... and a great many other things.

The most important takeaway from the Times story is Trumps bilked the federal government in two ways: by raking in federal housing subsidies on questionable grounds, and then defrauding the government of tax revenue using every trick in the book. @realDonaldTrump @BobSMueller pic.twitter.com/k5Zp3mgyvl
Hey @realDonaldTrump Would U happen to remember when you took out a full page ad calling for the execution of THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE who had already been exonerated? Police already had a confession from the real rapist. Where was your worry abt innocent young men then? #BLACK
Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his tax returns.
#DebateFlorida No matter which candidate you support, it was interesting to watch both @FLGovScott & @SenBillNelson give closing statements in Spanish. Bet @realDonaldTrump & @RonDeSantisFL won't be doing that.

@PressSed is a serial liar. She never tells the truth. Just like @realDonaldTrump and #Kavanaugh .
@realDonaldTrump Instead of having people connected to congress for Atty General Job, you can replace Rosenstein & Sessions with these two without a doubt, 1st select Jeanne Pirro & then select Kavanaugh (if not confirmed) who both will bring down the Deep State via Prosecutions!
@realDonaldTrump is just like his father, a fraud and a cheat. Don't forget his grandfather was the same way. He made his fortune from brothels. All this vileness runs in his family. Who cares how much the trumps cover themselves in gold, they're still vulgar, dirty, vermin.

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President. You are likely to receive a statement from the Dems. After the midterm election. WE WERE WRONG ABOUT THE MOTIVES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. And it is obvious by the election results. The American People believed we were wrong also.
Mr. President, be humble & show a little grace. Act presidential, Mr. President. Fix our government & stop destroying it. Stop destroying Obamacare & fix health care. Stop pandering to morons. Do some things because it is right. Lead & prove everybody wrong. @RealDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump is a vile human being. No respect for women or victims of sexual assault. He is the embodiment of rape culture. This makes me sick.
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr President - you said the FBI isn't being limited but they can't talk to the plaintiff or the defendant who's your SCUS nominee? What kind of con-job are you trying to pull here? If you say Kavanaugh is innocent let the @FBI do their job. #Kavanaugh #trump
@realDonaldTrump you do not have the right to decide what alerts I get on the cell phone I bought and the monthly bill I pay for. This is government over reach and an invasion of my privacy! I am publicly demanding you cease and desist!

Someone should tell Trump and his "folks" victims of trauma often block out random details about the trauma, a psychological defense that is automatic, while remembering the specifics of the trauma itself. @realDonaldTrump @cnnbrk @PressSec @AC360 @donlemon @krassenstein

Somewhere, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, there are sightless creatures who have never known sunlight, that have greater character than @realDonaldTrump and his collection of goons and vipers.
Not because of who you are Mr. Bongino, but because they would extend the same courtesy to every person. This is why the backbone of OUR United States backs @realDonaldTrump ... in turn, he backs us, the little guys. Thank you for sharing this story!

If there is any justice in this world, @realDonaldTrump presidency will not just be the worst thing that happened to us, but the worst thing that happened to him.
In my lifetime, I never thought I would ever see parents bring their young children to a rally to be taught "How to be a BULLY"...by the president, @realDonaldTrump of the United States of America. We are living in the Twilight Zone.
@realDonaldTrump at the age of around two, with medical proof from Lander Wyoming, I took a fall '62 or '63, I was born in '60 I was destined to be a Retard, it runs in the Family But how that fall occurred? Son, it was set up I know They never expect that Boy to be so agile
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity AS AMERICAN CITIZEN I REQUEST SHARPTON & ALL CONGRESS BE INVESTIGATED BY FBI, DOJ & IRS 4 "NOT FOR PROFIT ORG" & TAXES NOT PAID BY CONGRESS WHO & HOW MUCH 4 BEING PAID BY LOBBYIST, KILLARY. SOROS, DEMA-RATS & OTHERS HAVE FBI FOLLOW THEIR MILLIONS
Well, turns out @realDonaldTrump is as much an illegitimate business man as he is an illegitimate president. A fraud and loser all the way. Always has been. No surprise that the only deal he could do so far was already negotiated by his predecessor. SAD!

Welcome Mr. President @realDonaldTrump
God knows there are better conservative options for SCOTUS, that's my only point. My concern is that @realDonaldTrump wants #Kavanaugh as SCOTUS for #RussianCollusion self-interest.
What about the country. This guy is a partisan hack sworn in to protect @realDonaldTrump at all costs. Also will be protecting the rotten GOP. I hope he gets his ass impeached. What a piece of shit. I feel sorry for his complicit wife and daughters.
Hey U.K., answer 1 question: WHY were you begging @realDonaldTrump NOT to Declassify the FISA Docs? WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES DEMAND TRUTH & OUR DULY ELECTED @POTUS WILL GIVE THAT TRUTH TO HIS PEOPLE ! WE see you & your corruption! We are cleaning up the Cabal WW! #QAnon

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President (Don't get yourself in any trouble) But wouldn't it be great, to get the word to the people. If any Democrat Senator votes against Judge Kavanaugh and is up for re-election in November, the people will vote them out of their seat.

No matter how much success the country has, as long as @realDonaldTrump is your president, you will never be happy. So therefore, I will never listen to you.
Now Sen. Lisa Murkowski is blaming the White House & @realDonaldTrump for what happened to Judge Kavanaugh. She is spinning it to look good. Your democratic friends laughed this attack for the only reason to make the President look bad and score political points
By attacking the motives of women who accuse men of sexual predation, @GOP and @realDonaldTrump give license to such attacks and a defense to the perpatrators. By their own actions they make sexual assault and violence against women acceptable behavior.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS you will go down in history as the first fascist US president. you may also go down in history as the LAST US PRESIDENT. will dance on your grave, fascist.
@realDonaldTrump You are the worst person of today. I wish you would get impeached, you hypocritical, racist, lying piece of shit. You are a disgusting pig. A fraud. A fool. And you deserve hell for all your crimes. Your retarded administration and you can go to hell.
Remember, @realDonaldTrump is under federal/state investigations for Obstruction of Justice, Conspiracy Against the United States, election tampering, RICO crimes, tax evasion/fraud, international humanitarian crimes, and hopefully Treason. Mueller is coming for you, Trumps.

This is leadership. Because of @realDonaldTrump , America is BACK!
Watch how many conservative cases to restrict or repeal rights now get pushed up to the Supreme Court. This is why the @GOP sucked at @realDonaldTrump 's teat and debased their own party's legacy. Morals and ethics mean nothing when their regressive agenda is at stake.
What a great day to be an American, a Republican, and a Conservative. Congratulations to Justice Kavanaugh, a very brave and good man. Thank you @realDonaldTrump , the best President we have had in my 63 years. Winning is bliss! Now we must VOTE next month. #KavanaughConfirmed

I love how the Dems are so up and arms about @realDonaldTrump mocking Christine Blasey Ford (which I happen to not agree with) meanwhile 2 minutes ago the Dems did a 13 minute skit on SNL mocking Kavanaugh for getting emotional about his life being ruined by false accusations.

I find it very sad that even if Melania or Ivanna Trump were in Ms. Ford's place and raped by Brett Kavannaugh, that @realDonaldTrump would still swear that rapist in. It just shows everyone in our country how much Trump cares about women.
Wait until the elections and the next protest, which will make the last Women's March look like a church picnic: @realDonaldTrump
