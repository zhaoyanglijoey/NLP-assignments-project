This coming from this pathetic spineless human being who gets shit on all the time by @realDonaldTrump is rich. This clown is an embarrassment. @GOP @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump looks like the people of Iran are getting abused by the regime dictators.
A counter argument can easily be made that we wound up with @realDonaldTrump because people didn't do enough of it.
People just don't get itas to how violent it is out on our USA streets. Cops live it day in and day out, and they are targets of this scum. @aknancy077 @GeanineC @gartrelllinda @ceagpatriot @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza @sostrump1 @1st5d @SnowDov @SmithsCoffeepot @sxdoc
I feel so bad for my kid growing up is this day and age! Our government representatives our out for themselves and that is it! Everyone has gone so far left and right nothing is ever going to get fixed... yeah @realDonaldTrump is rude and crude, but so is the democratic party.
Liberals: #HillaryClinton has a 95% chance to beat @realDonaldTrump WRONG @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson
No legislation until those children are reunited with their parents. The fact that you are treating this administration like it is normal, emboldens the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump to continue their anti-democratic behavior. These are desperate times. Act like it.
If the people in your admin need secret service when none ever have before - costing tax payers unnecessary $$$ - you are doing it wrong. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #WorstPresidentEver #ImpeachTrump #Basta #BlueWave
Harley Davidson: an iconic motorcycle company. The Union Nail Company is what it says on the tin. As a direct result of @realDonaldTrump 's tariffs the latter is laying off 60 workers now & Harley is moving some production out of the US. 45 is threatening H-D with higher taxes.

He's also the judge @realDonaldTrump praised, in a tweet, as being "highly respected." Sometimes even the president gets it right, I suppose.
This is not win some lose some politics as usual. The @GOP lead by @RealDonaldtRUMP have become insane. Our survival is at stake. The future of the Republic is at stake. Our only hope is young people take politics seriously and vote! #TuesdayThoughts #FuckTrump #ccot #aarp

My beliefs about #America being a unique country has changed. @realDonaldTrump controls the executive, legislative, and the judicial branches. Trump has try 2 destroyed media, all of these moves r typical in a dictatorship. I wonder who will b the victims in next holocaust?

@realDonaldTrump could simply declassify all of them.
Same for our senator @SenJeffMerkley . We got a foster care, a child day care and child sex trafficking scandal in Portland, Oregon and he's down at the border. DNC is floating him for a possible 2020 run. @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @PressSec @VP
Interesting....it seems to be the American way for @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS & his kakistocracy as a whole. @PressSec is just a ventriloquist's dummy vomiting out the things Donny wants her to say. It's sad to see her prostitute herself in that manner.
@realDonaldTrump has 53 million followers on twitter. I think he should have at least 25 million likes and retweets per tweet. Come on Trumpers, support President Trump! #MAG #KAG

Miller is a NeverTrumper who resents our @POTUS because he doesn't fit HER picture of how he should be. Ordinary Americans know how POTUS @realDonaldTrump expresses his ideas and thoughts, and they understand his points. They don't care about hyperbole Miller calls half truths.
While we are talking "civility" Trumpers were throwing chicken shit at the RedHenVA today and death threats to unrelated Red Hens Maybe the asshole @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump should give them some security Cause the WH started this damn mess
Congratulations @realDonaldTrump !
Weird! After creating the last oil glut (Saudi Arabia in particular) and before Iran re-entered the market, now OPEC is saying it doesn't think it can supply the demand. smh As for @realDonaldTrump why should our allies bow to your wish after you stabbed them in the back?
#news @realDonaldTrump another way to help make america great again have someone investigate scum bags like @Sedgwick and how they screw injured workers while spending the money they took in to hold events for those not working. Perhaps someone should pull their Biz License.

Does someone want to inform this woman and other @realDonaldTrump supporters there are white folks who are rapists and drug dealers? Oh, and most mass killers in the US aren't people of color. Criminal behavior is not exclusive to any particular race.
I don't understand how Republicans can say @realDonaldTrump is a good businessman and he knows what he's doing. He went bankrupt 6 times, 7 if you count the US economy. His charity foundation is a joke and his college was a scam. You're kidding yourselves.

I'm so glad I am paying taxes so that #SarahSanders can have Secret Service protection until she gets over a mild case of butthurt. I'm sure they will be sent to buy her McDonald's and KFC and other menial tasks. The @realDonaldTrump administration is truly pathetic!

@JohnBrennan said that Al Qaeda' s first goal was to terrorize the United States and make us leave the world stage. The next time you listen to @realDonaldTrump remember that, and realize his policies come from a leader cowed by fear and intimidated by Islamic terror.
