@realDonaldTrump The only reason (beside obviously feeding yr pathological narcissism) was to further ur family and friend's interests and to reverse any action taken by President Obama (STILL DON'T THINK THINK THAT MAKES U A RACIST?)
@realDonaldTrump so if your keeping the 2nd ammendment then so Kim should keep his ICBM's .....United States of Hypocrisy
Ohhhh....here we go about the Russians... We've heard it for one year since @realDonaldTrump won @POTUS ...what's next after Mueller falls...it was the Martians? You people kill me...ignorant and blindsided by what you watch on @maddow
"Why stand up to Russians, enforce almost unanimously passed sanction on them, when I can just lay down and let them urinate on me...Again" @realDonaldTrump
If @realDonaldTrump is innocent, there no need to repeat No Collusion is there?
Spend the money on veterans services and the veterans themselves. The only purpose the parade will serve is to assuage the ego of one very small minded individual, @realDonaldTrump .
My #thoughtsandprayers are with @realDonaldTrump while #EmmaGonzales rips him with her words #GunReformNow

@hogangidley45 You work for the citizens of this country and you are the one sowing discord. @realDonaldTrump @GOP
That's why he slashing so many programs, so America can afford to pay for the secret service's golf carts and hotel rooms. America is also keeping @realDonaldTrump from bankruptcy, we're paying for all his clubs , casino, modeling company, and real estate.
Bernie, why did you use the exact same talking points as @realDonaldTrump to attack Hillary if even then during the campaign you knew much of the info was pushed by Russia and gotten illegally?
@realDonaldTrump shut the fuck up you cheating bastard, you think just cause you got money you can cheat on your wives with hoes? Bitch shut up you non Presidential Bitch. Come at me!
@realDonaldTrump is the best thing to happen to america, hope that didn't go over y'all heads
Why should Americans expect any less from @realDonaldTrump Appointees. I guess @realDonaldTrump wants Domestic Abusers and Sexual Assaulters in his Administration, so they have something to compare and talk about.
#Trump @realDonaldTrump is too soft on #HillaryClinton and #Obama administration. They have done everything rotten and illegal to stop him winning and to carry out a coup once he won. They have not stopped yet. But their criminality and corruption is being covered up & let off.
@realDonaldTrump IS cowardly.. #CadetBoneSpurs
@realDonaldTrump @benshapiro The illegal immigrants from Mexico were smarter than the ones from Russia. They meddled in our election by voting.
@realDonaldTrump do you know Emma Gonzalez? If not, YOU WILL soon enough #BS #shameonyou #EmmaGonzalezForPresident
"Many sides" . A la @realDonaldTrump . How tone deaf is that?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS is the Thunda & Lightening!

@realDonaldTrump joins the club with @BillCosby and @Tobuscus
PRES. @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SaraCarterDC @SeanHannity @FoxAndFriends @FOXNEWS @TruthFeedNews @BreitbartNews @DailyCaller @infowars @DRUDGE_REPORT @NyTimes @NyPost @NYDailyNews WHO WILL REPORT THE #TRUTH ABOUT THIS #NYPD STORY? #TRUMPTRAIN http:// bit.ly/2Bk9ikF pic.twitter.com/bWJoaLjXKD
@realDonaldTrump 95% of the drugs coming into the U.S. are coming by water, via non-commercial boats, container ships, fishing boats, speed boats and even submarines! How does a Wall prevent that? @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP #TCOT #MAGA #MAGA3X #TrumpTrain #Trump
People need to realize that @SpeakerRyan , @realDonaldTrump and the rest of the @GOP do not care about the American people. They only care about themselves and the money from their donors.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS is a #FakePresident who lies to the American people.
Trump never denied Russian meddling. Muller was trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. He couldn't. Accusations by the Democrats and MSM that the @realDonaldTrump campaign colluded with the Russians are false. That's what Trump called a hoax and a witch hunt!
Democrats suck. They need victims and issues, they do not solve problems like our great President! If they would work with @realDonaldTrump they would win elections again.

Get real why dident anyone cry when oboma was president I remember sandy hook when 20 CHILDREN died little kids and no one cried to him get real @realDonaldTrump
About @realDonaldTrump and his incompetence as president. But yep both yours views on how smart @KingJames is has NOTHING to do with race
We wouldn't need authority if the sane, honest people only had guns. We would just minimize problem factors. Hm. @realDonaldTrump
This is a photo of a real president who truly cares about his country's citizens. Maybe you should learn from him @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President- There has to be an ounce of humanity in you somewhere. Listen to these children. Look at the massacres below. ACT on a reasonable automatic weapons ban & a comprehensive NATIONAL background check/waiting period for all firearms purchases. PLEASE! pic.twitter.com/3noAjDoEUs
Dear @realDonaldTrump it has now been 3 days since the last mass shooting in the United states. I'm going to tweet at you every day until you and the government do something about it. #GunControlNow #DonaldTrump #ThoughtsAndPrayersDoNothing I encourage everyone to do the same.
@realDonaldTrump So weird the protestors over Florida are all cool that no teacher called the FBI after expelling him for violence whilst knowing he had a gun fetish, it's like letting a crazed dog loose really isn't it yet Trump gets the anger instead, bizarre.
YOU ARE SOUNDING SO NERVOUS @realDonaldTrump Between Russia affair closing in and your affairs cheating on @FLOTUS coming out. #UnfitForOffice
Any @GOP Rep who's reading @realdonaldtrump 's crazed tweets and doesn't understand that there is a madman in the Oval Office deserves to burn in hell right along with him. If you don't impeach him, he'll kill us, himself, or both.
@realDonaldTrump As an American, you and all leaders, should be outraged that ANYONE would cyberattack American!

@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity @JudgeJeanine @maddow I think the indictment shows DT Presidency is not legit!!!
To: @realDonaldTrump FDR was an effective leader and a great President! He made great progress at wiping out poverty. He was elected 4 terms. You're no Franklin D. Roosevelt. Take a lesson. pic.twitter.com/OBLRi1ZJwi
The Recipient's of the @NRA fundings is also part of the Terrorist's Monopoly franchise Enterprise too is @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @FlGovScott
Bro our nation is in shock and devastated right now and all you can do is divide us even more!! I have never said this about anyone but your coming off as being pathetic. Your our president @realDonaldTrump Rene the bigger man rite now and bring us together!! please stop bro..
What if we all blocked @realDonaldTrump ?
Interestingly, if you look at some of those (entrenched power, corporate interest and propaganda in particular) they can almost be aligned with "drain the swamp" as espoused by @realdonaldtrump , so the GOP should really pull their finger out and get onboard. Course, they won't
