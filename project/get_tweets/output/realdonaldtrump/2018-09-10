@realDonaldTrump Mr President, who gave you the information on the unemployment rate & 100 years. Either they lied or someone lied to them, probably to make you look bad. Find them fire them and who they're friends with. You are so loyal, others are not.
@realDonaldTrump Kevin McCarthey is not going to be any better than Paul Ryan!!!!

The explains why @realDonaldTrump lies constantly. Thank you for pointing this out. Acceptance is first step.
America @realDonaldTrump understands, its the corruption from the past administration at the expense of the forgotten men and women of the U.S. that's in question!
@realDonaldTrump ..will be interesting to see how you support North Carolina....just like Puerto Rico?
In other words, they are the same as most Republicans were before @realDonaldTrump was elected & proved politicians CAN keep promises.

Smart observation. I agree this may be necessary for now. But Trump @realDonaldTrump is a child and does not think.

@realDonaldTrump BE Firm, truthful, BUT humble. No need to brag. @FLOTUS
2007-2008, my #Democrats friends said (& I agreed), WE don't support #torture or the 2 wars started by #GeorgeBush . Then, they elected #Obama , who continued to protect torture & added 5 more war fronts. And...... silence. But, will @realDonaldTrump prove any better?
TRUMP SHOWS IGNORANCE OF ECONOMIC HISTORY. 185 times in the past was GDP greater than unemployment rate. TRUMP would have know this if he read anything at all. Wharton School did not help Trump one bit. @realDonaldTrump
