Here's really how it's going to go: 2020 - @realDonaldTrump is re-elected 2024 - @nikkihaley is the first woman to be elected POTUS If liberals want to dominate they'd better come up with a better message than "resist Trump". That's how you lost the last election.
"A Declaration signed by immigrants" @realDonaldTrump , an immigrant himself, "Let get rid of all immigrants that don't look like us!" We will get ICE (our SS) to "deal" with them!
Freedom is never free. WE WANT JUSTICE NOT POLITICS.... OPEN THE DAMN DOORS QUIT PROTECTING THE CRIMINALS.. @SaraCarterDC @TheLastRefuge2 @SebGorka @dbongino @ChuckRossDC @JudicialWatch @SharylAttkisson @ACLJ @RealAlexJones @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/zl9p4plpM4
I'm sure that is why @realDonaldTrump approval rating is higher than Obama's was at the same point in his presidency... It must be because nobody likes him.
It seems to me that anyone who believes the tweets of @realDonaldTrump would be like taking black spray paint to your third eye. It's a wonder his followers can see anything at this point. Blind faith will always bite you down the line.
He is incapable of "choosing" what he'll say. He can only blurt. A 73-word vocabulary is a burden to him. He needs an interpreter to tweet in English. How's he gonna handle Putinspeak? #resist #FourthofJuly2018 @realDonaldTrump
I wonder if the candidate who runs against @realDonaldTrump will use the slogan "make America great again" ... #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump What happened to your head????
@JuanManSantos continues to postpone @JSantrich_FARC 's extradition and, in the meantime, believes that @realDonaldTrump is being cheated by sending him small fish ... But he does not even think that they will continue to eat him. Trump is not a drop of the wattle.
