I HATE GOP double standards! Anyone remember this.... @DonaldJTrumpJr advice to thin skinned women? Wonder why this doesn't same advice apply to his father?

No country should be allowed in the WTO unless they have a freely convertible currency. I.e., no China @realDonaldTrump
Trump has shown highly abnormal behavior by lying routinely to the American people without compunction, intentionally fueling divisions in our country and actively working to degrade the critical institutions that serve us. https:// buff.ly/2LebAn4 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump

So we are all in agreement @realDonaldTrump hacked the Buffalo Wild Wings twitter account right? Right.
If @realDonaldTrump watches it on Fox News, he will think they are a cult who worship him. Their luminous sashes match his skin tone.

Which is not surprising since Bumbling Buffoon Benedict @realDonaldTrump loves dictators as he's desperate to be one. Unfortunately for him that's never going to happen as the people will take him out of he ever even thinks about that.

@realDonaldTrump celebratory excess now at Camp David: DT: I'm so great! I've saved the world! Big Macs for everybody on me! Camp David Chef: Ummm... we don't have any McDonalds nearby. There's a White Castles... DT: Even better! Gut bombs for everybody on me!
Can anybody imagine the uproar had @realDonaldTrump gone on the apprentice one night and yelled at one of Obama's daughters "put something tight and low cut on and climb into your daddy's lap and demand he change his policies you feckless cunt!" I can.
Cheaper than @realDonaldTrump 's Mar-a-Lago trips.
Oh boy you guys making jokes about Kim Jong Un purposely using the big envelope to make @realDonaldTrump hands look small is gonna cuz him to cancel the summit.
@realDonaldTrump Hurting our relations with Europe, Canada & Mexico on the new Tariffs!! UNREAL! Way to make our Allies unhappy..INCREDIABLE! Are you kidding me? We are now paying more for EVERYTHING including new cars!! Here's another reason you need to be impeached. #TRUMPOUT

@hardball : Although, I have always thought @MarthaStewart was punished bcause she's a woman for what many men have gotten away w including @realDonaldTrump . I also didn't know that she went to jail for lying to FBI investigators. The entireTrump family should've served times 1/2
I HERE BY CALL FOR DONALD J TRUMP TO RESIGN. @realDonaldTrump
This is why liberals and economics don't mix. Like oil and water. @realDonaldTrump cut taxes and there was still a record in the first quarter in government income (tax income).
This is my wet dream comes true. The US RWNJs and @FoxNews like @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle etc praising Pussy Man @realDonaldTrump appeasement of that Greatest Capitalist & Democrat of our time Kim King Un
@TheCNN @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump has the gall to brag abt the ECONOMY that he actually inherited from @POTUS44 & hasn't managed to undo it like he does other Obama works, just for the hell of it to hurt Obama & destroy his history
I wonder what's inside lol @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/T8vMPGhDF7
I hope @realDonaldTrump didn't mistakenly offer lunch of a crispy burrito bowl. @SteveDoocy said on @foxandfriends that @potus greeted him by saying "Happy Cinco de Mayo, which is Korean for crisp w/mayonaise." @cnnbrk @AC360
@realDonaldTrump How long before we privatize the @USPS ? Our service out of @CityofBaytown is like a third world country! @tedcruz
2) @realDonaldTrump is the First President popularly trusted by a majority of Americans since Ronald Reagan and the first to take on the Federal System since the early days of JFK. I trust that we have correct Intel that says that POTUS is working closely with @USMC .
@realDonaldTrump : Please, before the summit, would you please learn to bow when someone bows to you. In the Far East it is only a sign of respect. This is a common greeting and you should do it too. I have a Chinese sister-in-law. She bowed before my parents graves. Mad me cry.

@realDonaldTrump apply for Medicaid.. now I have no insurance, and my account is all messed up. I just got off the phone with my insurance company and all they could do was tell me that I'm not the only one that is having problems and it is their system. I should call back.
This is the America @realDonaldTrump has brought us. It's sick. Where is the FBI???
The mounting evidence of @realDonaldTrump criminal acts has led to a comparison between Trump and Richard Nixon....but I think the comparison is not well placed. Richard Nixon before he became a politician was an attorney Donald Trump before he became a politician was a crook.
The immigrants coming into our country are not the animals the administration would have us believe. They are seeking asylum and instead their children are being punished by the animal in our @TheJusticeDept Jeff Sessions and the animal in the @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA. OHSU called me this morning and let me know that my insurance will not allow me to continue my treatments with them. They said that if I could get Medicaid, that I can continue with my treatments at OHSU. I went online,,,
Hey @realDonaldTrump did you read the letter or did you not read the letter. Do you even know how to open a letter. Also tweeting about the jobs report ahead of its release is gross misconduct idiot.

Today Donald Trump said: "We are being respected again, we are being respected abroad..." Mr. President, the US was vastly more respected abroad under Mr. Obama. You are, quite simply, delusional. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama

An incredible action by @POTUS to watch play out today. The thought of ending over 70 years of war is an incredible feeling. An end to the Korean war would affect the lives of millions and save our country BILLIONS. @realDonaldTrump will be known as the President of world peace.
America knows. The GOP? Nope. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump sooner or later you will be impeached for you are a pathological liar.
@realdonaldtrump What about Puerto Rico????????
But, why? Seriously. Why can @realDonaldTrump call private citizens sons of bitches, but people get up in arms over this? (Spoiler: I suspect I know why.)

Its funny how its ok if media & celebrity do it to @realDonaldTrump but if he comments or tweets and they dont like it the big R card comes flying out
Tonight my 2 year old clung to me as his daddy pulled him from my arms for his bath so I could begin dinner...& I was immediately heartsick all over again for the parents whose children were ripped from their arms and then lost by the monster that is @realDonaldTrump FIND THEM!

You do realize that your hyperbolic rants expose your inability to actually participate in any meaningful debate, right? Not to mention exposing yourself as a vitriol spouting fool. I'd be interested in some real examples of "overt racism" by @realDonaldTrump .
