@realDonaldTrump If schools are ever NOT considered gun free zones, there's going to be a massive jump in homeschooling. I'd rather have a child that may not be as educated, rather than a dead one.
The entire @realdonaldtrump fake presidency/ Russia scandal should be called #StupidGate , seeing as how these are not smart criminals. In fact, everyone involved is a fucking idiot! #TrumpRussia
Oprah responds to Trump's 'insecure' comment: 'I don't like giving negativity power' http:// fxn.ws/2opCD5n #FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Here we go - lol. Let the games begin. Fun to watch.
Just another lie @realDonaldTrump tells his base. Why a Christian tolerates this dotard is beyond any logic?
@realDonaldTrump So are the Charleston resists you got behind when they murdered!
@realDonaldTrump is a great judge of character right? Only the best people.
@realDonaldTrump You have some good ideas on gun measures. However, the no fly list is crap. Once you get on that list even if it is a mistake it's near impossible to get off. Sen Teddy Kennedy was on that list. I will support most other measures.
is @realDonaldTrump shaking?

Does right wing adoration of @realDonaldTrump signal the end of democracy or the end of right wing politics as we've known it. Probably both. But the Mob decides the future, not politicians. The Mob is speaking!
So Los Angeles radio station - super RW but it has good traffic info - announced that . @realDonaldTrump threatens to remove ICE officers from California - becuz to do so will turn CA into a cesspool - am I worried? NOPE - get them all out of Los Angeles - NOW!!!
I sleep in peace with @realDonaldTrump as our @POTUS . The storm is coming. The IG report with be the undoing of Team Hillary and Muslim Barry. Globalism don't fly in America. Sad that a Vet like you doesn't get that!
I really want to see . @realDonaldTrump 's tax returns. Birds of a feather... I hope Mueller has... #GOPComplicit #GOPCorruption . @SpeakerRyan . @SenateMajLdr - try upholding your oaths of office & defending our country & our constitution! #BlueWave2018

Why doesn't @realDonaldTrump let the States decide on this gun issue. If it works more states will follow. #ParklandStudentsSpeak #Parkland #NRABloodMoney #NRA #bumpstocks #backgroundchecks
I watched @realDonaldTrump during his roundtable today. He was focused, gracious, polite, and confident. This is a man who loves America and her citizens. He is the right man at the right place in the right time. God Bless our @POTUS , and please pray for him.
@realDonaldTrump New indictments. Tic Toc.
@realDonaldTrump 's white house: sending more fake boobs to korea
No, NO @realDonaldTrump ...NO ARMING OF TEACHERS--military-trained or otherwise. No bonuses as incentives, etc. PLEASE GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD (& consult w/experts--including psychologists on possible effects on children & learning--BEFORE publicly sharing your next idea).

@realDonaldTrump now supports some gun control. Why do news organizations fixate on the friction this will cause with the #NRA , and not acknowledge his willingness to evolve his position?
@realDonaldTrump just in case no one's considered this & I believe it to be the truth it will be the left trying to implemen New World Order

Public schools will be converted to military schools, if @realDonaldTrump gets his way. Those Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini comparisons are starting to add up.

@realDonaldTrump "I know the best people" @FoxNews I would suggest this is a sacking offense and if your own journalists don't call this BS out, they should hand in their union cards
@realDonaldTrump Sir, please do not make the hard working people of California suffer due to the ignorance of its political party in action. If I had my way, I would be living North of Commifornia in the great State of Jefferson!

@realDonaldTrump BTW, you should apologize to Oprah. She actually had the editors include MORE pro-trump content so as NOT to favor one side or the other.
This way, the @gop @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump budget that slashes money for school security can leverage existing teachers to be sharpshooters. Fantasy land economics and fantasy land security. But they will keep getting NRA $. That's their real priority.
@realDonaldTrump Pick up the phone & have a long chat to former PM Mr John Howard.
@realDonaldTrump there WAS an armed police officer at Douglas the day of the shooting and it didn't help, proving the fact that having weapons on school grounds will NOT solve this problem. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow

@realDonaldTrump wont stand up against Putin in Syria (or anywhere) so the humanitarian disaster will continue. @BretBaier

You do have 2 give it 2 some - @realDonaldTrump - 4 putting the idea out there. Spitballing as it were instead of just saying "We have to do something" or "we have to do better." Whether it is "stupid" is not the point, but it does get ppl talking & whittle down to good ideas.
Sign of the times that something this self-evident should be considered a victory. #drainthenra #Presidementia @NRA @realDonaldTrump #Impeach45
@realDonaldTrump is sentenced for fulfilling 3 years of military service, I'm sure that when he finishes he will be a much better person and may choose to study a university career . That is my humble contribution. It would be a pleasure if this letter came to you.
@realDonaldTrump IF you wanted to see REALLY BIG Rally, with HUGE CROWDS you should have accepted @jaketapper invitation. I bet even more people would have shone up to make you hear their VOICE.
@realDonaldTrump The answer ISN'T MORE GUNS MORON. Teachers snap too, especially when your 20% of all teachers is 700k more guns. #BanAssaultRifles #BanMachineGuns #NeverAgain HURRY MUELLER. Prison will be great, talk tough there you fucking idiot.
@realDonaldTrump did you know? An armed officer stayed outside during the Parkland shooting? Piece of shit didn't even go into the school and shoot down Cruz
You are correct to the tune 30 million laundered through the @NRA and of course there is that Russian thing. @realDonaldTrump @The_Trump_Train #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump . Arming teachers is wrong and not the way to fix the problem. Making schools safer can only be accomplished with education!
I'm willing to bet good money that @realDonaldTrump couldn't even pull the trigger on the smallest handgun, it would fly right out of those little baby hands!! #GunControlNow #TYTLive

Appear by Jan 11th, this is why the american people, hates the Swamp;/DC. @SenJohnMcCain should either resign or make this aid come forth now. He was part of that dossier as well and he has to know what the aid got, who he got it from . Come on Sen this is bs!! @realDonaldTrump
#ShutUpAndDoSomething you are not looking to solve problem but looking to create more gun tragedies! @realDonaldTrump @VP

@realDonaldTrump In regards to My feeling so much hate from Dems, It was specifically when they were at shooting range, and it felt like they were shoot at Conservatives. Did they have a Trump target? I think I remember that! This is not the America I grew up in! Socialists >
The trained, armed county deputy on duty at the school didn't even go inside when the shooting started, but @realDonaldTrump thinks that arming teachers will end school shootings.
@realDonaldTrump ...if teacher pulls gun on shooter and gets killed? Then shooter has ANOTHER gun. I swear, MOST of the SHIT that comes out of your mouth is LIES, but this is JUST PLAIN STUPID. Get a grip. #IMPEACHTRUMP #TREASON . #NEVERAGAIN #LIARINCHIEF

@realDonaldTrump rather than supporting more guns, lets discuss all options privately..give the public a window of a plan.. day to day updates only adds confusion.. also lets think out of the box... an idea i have... simple quick and will support all sides...
A trained resource deputy wouldn't go in to try to save lives @realDonaldTrump but we should arm teachers.
@realDonaldTrump Presidents don't make history; they rise to the occasion when defining moments present themselves. This is your moment. You have the chance to go down in history as the president who made the country safe again by brokering common-sense gun laws. Don't f-up.
I doubt Obama has the significant number of bad hair days that @realDonaldTrump tries to hide with his stupid hats. Plus Obama didn't promote products he was buying from China for $.25 and reselling to suckers for $40.00.

@realDonaldTrump More than 300 million guns in the U.S. An "assault weapon" ban would be useless and an all out gun confiscation like the left is leaning to would be a disaster.
