At least he did. @realDonaldTrump should follow his lead.
@realDonaldTrump just put out a proposal that the Democrats will never accept on immigration. Some of you please relax and realize what's going on. And for any of you who are still so stupid as to think he's selling us all out. You need to GROW UP AND WAKE UP!

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President Trump this new deal for the 1.8million is a ruse. It won't be just the 1.8million. This is nothing but a slow walk to amnesty! After you're gone the number is going to grow to 7 or 8 million. Don't trust that TRUST fund for the wall.
@FCC Please revoke @FoxNews channel license immediately. They are constantly promoting conspiracy news stories (their FAKENEWS), Our country will be better without them. Stop the lies! @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @seanhannity @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
Stormy Daniels friend breaks silence and affirms @realDonaldTrump did have a sexual relationship with Stormy and attempted to have her even join them. Well that is enough to prove it for me. #TrumpSexProbe #ImpeachTrump Guess Trump and his lawyer lied?
@realDonaldTrump On DACA, NOBODY should get in line for citizenship until wall is completed. This way democrats can't defund wall.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for representing us so well abroad! We are so proud of you! God bless you! We love you! #AmericaFirst
@realDonaldTrump Whoever is advising you on DACA giveaway should be fired.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President it is a huge mistake to give amnesty to 1.8 million illegal aliens. All you are really doing is legalizing illegal immigration and encouraging chain migration. In the end it will be their whole 30 family members as well More like 45 Million
Not my grandchildren. I am ashamed to even allow them to hear anything he says. @realDonaldTrump is the worst example for any one especially children. He is a cheater a liar a racist ... and and and. Not for my grandchildren!! @POTUS44 was a real example is dignity respect
Hey @VicenteFoxQue & @cthagod & @breakfastclubam great interview with former president Vicente! He's always the best! I know how corrupt the US GOVERNMENT is& how they pump guns & drugs into the country & profit off arrests & prisons! F$&@@realDonaldTrump @Chris_L_Massey @Rosie

@realDonaldTrump no deal for illegals! Our citizens first! America first! Legal immigrants first!
No one but the AMERICAN PEOPLE need to REVIEW THE MEMO!!! PERIOD...NOT the DOJ and NOT the FBI!!!! @realDonaldTrump ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
DACA was unconstitutional from the beginning, be happy that @realDonaldTrump is entertaining a path to citizenship when in reality they should pay up for the immigration status or be let out.... "You're Fired!" #AmericaFirst #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SebGorka @StevenKBannon @newtgingrich @RealJamesWoods This is a Crap Plan too many illegals getting citizenship no daca no amnesty deport them pic.twitter.com/Oyi7dz5nNf

. @realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, you are doing such a magnificent job. Now, please don't ruin it by proposing #Amnesty , even if it's a trade for the wall. We have suffered terribly due to the 1986 amnesty and have been counting on you to protect us from another amnesty.
Because #CIA #FBI held Innocent Americans like myself oh wait I'm #Mexican in #GhostPrisons then threaten us to do dirty work @realdonaldtrump
As one of the people lucky enough to have their job be one of the first to enact the new tax code I can say thanks a fucking million to @realDonaldTrump for the extra 4 dollars in my check. #GOPTaxScam #TaxScamBill #TaxReform

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump For God's sake, if there is a MEMO, release it Now! You can order this and declassify it. Stop this crap. It's all really getting old! I'm a strong supporter, but it's getting really OLD! If the Left want to continue Obstructing, SCREW them all! Just do it
Now I see what @StormyDaniels was doing. By implicating @realDonaldTrump , she could grow her membership to her all access site. Smart and stupid.
Any chance we can get a Democrat to be interviewed on @FoxNews about, whatever, and have that Dem speak directly into the camera and say "We all know @realDonaldTrump is too cowardly to talk to Big Bob Mueller." Then . . . wait.

@realDonaldTrump Remember "Lying Ted" and "Lying Hillary?" Don't be like them. Deport all illegal aliens and do NOT grant amnesty.
@realDonaldTrump I guess he thinks he is the president. Steven Miller, John Kelly, Mitch McConell and now John Dowd tells him what to do.

@realDonaldTrump So let me get it straight. If a cop is pointing a gun at me because I punched him, and then I shoot him. Is that "Fighting Back"? I know that sounds extreme, but firing Comey was extreme as well.
@realDonaldTrump never cared about players kneeling. He just wanted to find something to go after the NFL for to assist his buddy Vince in his latest venture. I'm sure Trump will get his piece if it comes to fruition, he does NOTHING for free.

@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I think the 880,000. dreamers should become legal now, and there should be a path to citizenship for them within 10 to 12 years if we get the wall, an end to chain migration, and an end to the immigration lottery.
so much for testifying under a oath @realDonaldTrump . After all who is in control ?
Right, because that's the only way women should react when their husband/partner cheats on them @FLOTUS is smarter than @realDonaldTrump .... she's probably cleaning out her belongings and heading back to the #NYC golden penthouse (Possession is 9/10th of law)

Dear @realDonaldTrump , The greatest lesson in life is to know that even fools are right sometimes.
