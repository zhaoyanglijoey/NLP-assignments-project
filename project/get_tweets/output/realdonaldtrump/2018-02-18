President @realDonaldTrump , while doing nothing about Russian interference of our election, is crying " @POTUS44 should have done something."
This is bs. @POTUS . Is using this to avoid the cnn town hall with douglas students. Today they made it clear they wanted @realDonaldTrump , @marcorubio , gov. Scott and both fl reps there. I bet only one will show.

@realDonaldTrump So another Trump Team Member will plead guilty to fraud. That is what Trump is as President, A FRAUD. You time is coming.
Reporting the news would be.. @realDonaldTrump tweets new tweets today! @brianstelter goes further. He is giving an opinion then asking if people agree with him so it looks like an innocent question, trying to convince gullible/weak minded people over to his negative/sick views!
We'll see if there's will to prosecute? Presently, a clear case of "Sedition" by @realDonaldTrump & GOP. Incitement of violence, rebellion in "Actions" & "Writing" promoting discontentment against the US Government and Intelligence Community. @SpeakerRyan
@realDonaldTrump you are an idiot

@realDonaldTrump is going to meet them at the same time these students who want to speak to him are doing a town hall CNN. He was invited but refused, He is a coward. #ParklandStrong
#Parkland . Did you think @realDonaldTrump would show empathy? Compassion or offer solutions? He's angry he can't golf
One thing is for sure, if the shooter had been Muslim or illegal immigrant, @realDonaldTrump would have been tweeting and @FoxNews would have been reporting it before the last bullet was fired.

@realDonaldTrump Oh, did you finally get nude trump photos schiffy? Meet with any Russians while you were in Germany? Better yet, why did they let you go with McMasters to Germany?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President...I'm never going to win a championship in anything, but I can tell you if I was ever invited to the WH I would gladly and respectfully show up.
Rep Schiff: never forget that Sen McConnell impeded Pres Obama's efforts to do more about Russia's meddling in our election. @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr

@realDonaldTrump make your kids stay home
What's your childish Nic name for Putin , @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ?
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to demand that Vladimir Putin extradite the Russians charged with election meddling crimes so they may be tried in the US? A true patriot devoted to our democracy, and a president with real power and nothing to hide, would do that. If not, why not?
This is not going away. We need action! @RepJasonLewis @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr #DoNothingJason #mn02 #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
I find it actually shocking that people don't believe in gun regulation. Like actually crazy. Reading Facebook debates and Twitter threads this past week has made my brain explode. And don't get me started on @realDonaldTrump .
And #Leftists #Progressives #Democrats wonder why #Evangelicals support @RealDonaldTrump http:// bit.ly/2FeWI64
@realDonaldTrump And the only reason he had to mention #Parkland was to try to blame others. What a coward.

@realDonaldTrump wake up people
So after over 10 million spent and 16 months of investigating, the indict 13 trolls from Russia. No collusion between Russia and @realDonaldTrump . To make it up, FBI and DOJ need to prosecute the obvious corruption of the previous administration. @CNN @MSNBC will not report facts

He never said Russia didn't meddle, @realDonaldTrump just said he trusted Putin's denial of meddling... duhhhh that's like not even the same story its not like both have anything to do with an enemy power trying to subvert our democracy or anything like that.... #fakenews
@FactCurmudgeon @realDonaldTrump It's not " #Whataboutism , it's fact; the Dems did 0. As long as Dems pretend otherwise, reminder "Whataboutism" implies that one ignores wrong "X" because wrong "Y" exists; I haven't done that. The @GOP must now do what the Dems never tried to do.
@realDonaldTrump keep your kids at home
Remember, @realDonaldTrump doesn't care one bit what you say/do so don't be shocked by him. He took office only to put in place changes to expand his/cronies wealth. After he's gone, he will just be richer and happier. Regardless of what we lose #Trump
Very SAD! @realDonaldTrump the worst thing that ever happened to America!
President Trump does not want to punish Russia for its electoral interference. He has made this clear by his words and his lack of actions. His refusal to enforce the sanctions and his continual praise of Putin. @realDonaldTrump @VP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr #PutinsPuppet
@realDonaldTrump You better say my name Jesha Miller petition's checks & balances in press conference 2-19-2018 to save yourself because evidence makes Judicial Branch caught imposing slavery, http:// jeshamiller.simplesite.com
Wait, @realDonaldTrump lied? In other news, water is wet and the sun rises in the East.
@realDonaldTrump , you should disband the secret service and ask your aupporters for thier thoughts and prayers in protecting you if you think thoughts and prayers will save us from gun violence.
Has anyone else noticed a spike in the volume and insanity of @realDonaldTrump 's tweets before every single big development in the Russia investigation? Can one of you more statistically inclined peeps make a chart?
@realDonaldTrump stop this bull shit b
@realDonaldTrump Every country of the world has banned the use of guns. Result no mass shooting. Perhaps we should ban people that have mental problems, Starting with you, Mr President, from being a President.
Linda @realDonaldTrump is planning a DIALOG day with students from #parklandhighschool How you see that going?
There's a difference between someones public opinion and just being straight un-American. There's also a big difference between not supporting our President Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ,) and being an unpatriotic asshole. For example, I didn't vote Trump, but won't bash our leader.
Thank U so much @realDonaldTrump ! ICE is in Los Angeles picking up illegals in spite of @JerryBrownGov @NancyPelosi et al. Please, please send them up 2 Sacramento! Maybe U can accidentally take Brown/Pelosi @RealJamesWoods @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @SheriffClarke
Poll Question for @realDonaldTrump supporters: Are you concerned that we're not moving forward with congressionaly approved sanctions against Russia, even after @POTUS has acknowledged Russia attacked our last election? If not, why? #MAGA ; #TrumpRussia

REMINDER: The @NRA is a terrorist organization backed by the @GOP & @realDonaldTrump . REMINDER: @DLoesch advocated for the alt-right to arm themselves and prepare for "War" against liberals, moderates, libertarians, and moderate conservatives. Republicans are deranged people.
You danced, while kids died and others grieved. Prayers don't stop bullets, caused by @realDonaldTrump reversal of President Obama's BAN on Mentally Ill Buying Assault Weapons by little donny's ego.
The second worst thing besides @realDonaldTrump being president? The shitty plans for @SpoletoFestival finale

I kinda think the Russian mafia swooped in paid off his bankruptcies, gave him cash to keep him flush and re-invest..they just plain OWN his fat ass. Then his proclivity for sex ... he was an easy target plus he's stupid What say you @realDonaldTrump .....pretty close to truth?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Yes, Mr. President, it's worth it! Thanks for putting up with all the BS for us and the country. You'd figure all American's would want a better country, but some, for whatever reason, want Socialism or Communism. Go figure! pic.twitter.com/rrj2rPmgMS
You think saying #FakeNews or blaming the @FBI is going to distract us from our mission? The only thing that is fake is you. Our commitment to #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives #GunControlNow #GunReformNow is very very real @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Time POTUS & FLOTUS to consider impromptu open town hall meetings where you do so well when directly answering the Liberal Voter. With your Press Sec as Moderator b/w you and Jane/Joe Public. No need for debate, just Q&A.
So because Obama didn't take prevent Russian election interference, you are just going to make sure they can get away with more of it? We can now add #DerelictionOfDuty to the many crimes committed by @realDonaldTrump
