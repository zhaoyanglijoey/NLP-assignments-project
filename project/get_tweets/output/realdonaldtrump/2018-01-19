Menendez It is called JURY TAMPERING and it is ILLEGAL....! $100 Million FRAUD and they ONLY HAD TO PAY OFF ONE JUROR...! Investigate that...! @USAGSessions @TheJusticeDept ANYTHING, MR AG...? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump is letting the government #shutdown because he thinks it means he gets to go home.
@GOPand Trump @potus @realDonaldTrump is responsible given that the senate House and Whithouse is under GOP ( aka ) Republican control and so you own it
Hope @realDonaldTrump doesn't sexually assault the country. Heard he doesn't like getting shut down.. #17Women ? #ImpeachTrump
@realDonaldTrump #winning ? After 1 year all you've achieved is a path to US bankruptcy via the #TaxScam & a #GovShutDown . #HappyAnniversary
@SenSanders , I agree it is hard to run the military on a month-to-month basis! You can get thank yourself and @TheDemocrats for that since u guys give all our money away to entitlement programs & illegals! #americafirst #fixittrump @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump
#TheResistance #FBR #FBRParty ... #GOP & @realDonaldTrump are like #GreenGoblin asking #SpiderMan ( @chuckschumer & #Democrats ) to choose his gf or a schoolbus full of kids ( #DACA or #CHIP ). Can they sace both? #TrumpShutdown Country is watching! #TrumpTrain #Maga this is on u!
@realDonaldTrump and America is winning SO BAD with the #SchumerShutdown hashtag, The Left feels like Russia hacked twitter (No, The Left leaning liberals are getting served by conservatives and the #MAGA Coalition). It's not #TrumpShutdown . Chuck is now "Shutdown" Schumer!
Democrats don't hold any branch of Government... They can't shutdown shit... @realDonaldTrump stop fucking lying @GOP
How many abortions to you think @realDonaldTrump has paid for??
How brilliant is @realDonaldTrump ? After labeling the shutdown the #SchumerShutdown Then calls Schumer to the White House. If no deal is reached Schumer has been a prop and will be blamed for all of this. Trump will say I offered him everything and he would not deal. LABLED HIM!
@realDonaldTrump , #KeepYourPromise sir!
@realDonaldTrump spent all last week promising "A deal for #DACA " in this #ContinuingResolution . Did @SenMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan not get the memo or do they really #hate #dreamers that much? Never mind THE notion of a CR being #NewNormal ! Only #ThirdParty can #DrainTheSwamp pic.twitter.com/LzCAI0l2AH
@realDonaldTrump -NO TO DACA! #DelusionalAmnestyCancerousAgenda
So if the government shuts down, and they send non-essential government employees home, does that mean we finally get rid of @realDonaldTrump ?because he is about as useless as they come.
What @realDonaldTrump doesn't seem to get is that nobody wants his monument to racism and stupidity. And we certainly don't want to pay for it.
. @realDonaldTrump ...THIS!!!! Do it!!!!! #ReleaseTheMemo

@realDonaldTrump In 2011 on NBC you said abt the #shutdown "If there is a shutdown I think it would be a tremendously negative mark on the president of the United States. He's the one that has to get people together". Does this statement only apply to black presidents? #hypocrite
Like he and the bone spurs commander in chief @realDonaldTrump know anything?!?!
Supporters of @realDonaldTrump once again show their lack of humor. They're freaking out over #Trumps1stYearAtHogwarts . In these trying and worst of times for our country, a sense of humor is very much needed.
@realDonaldTrump Now that is how you close a deal!
Make America Great Again, by getting on the no Democrat plan. Vote all GOP in November 2018, and no more Democrat lawmakers will be seen. @GOP @realDonaldTrump
With all those corporate tax cuts @realDonaldTrump just gave, why in the world would @amazon raise their monthly prime membership? Why not have tax cuts AND raise membership fees. Right?!?!

@realDonaldTrump is doing nothing to stop #GovermentShutdown . He said he would sign DACA, but that was a lie. He is just a terrible leader.

@realDonaldTrump and his brigade will likely get themselves thrown in jail prior to getting thrown in prison.
You gotta remember that when @realDonaldTrump says "contribute to society" he means "bring shitloads of cash." That's why his immigration "merit system" puts high emphasis on wealth.
