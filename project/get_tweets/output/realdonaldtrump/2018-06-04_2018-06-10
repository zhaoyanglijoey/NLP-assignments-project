Thank you @SRuhle for calling out @realDonaldTrump lies!!
@realDonaldTrump is a dark stain on humanity.
@realDonaldTrump wants a country where he tells us what we can and can't do. Some1 please tell this orange, out for his own interests, idiot, that our military has been fighting 4 our freedoms 4 yearrsssss. 1 of those freedoms is 2 stand, or sit, or kneel when we want. #Eagles
@realDonaldTrump ALERT #FreeTommyRobinson Mr President, please stand up for this good guy and a patriot !!! Don't let those totalitarian elites in the United Kingdom to imprison people just like that, just like in Orwell's "1984", please raise the issue of his imprisonment
The @Eagles have earned my respect. While I always liked the team this just proves that they are the real deal. This vet will kneel with the players before she stands with the orange traitor in chief. @realDonaldTrump #makingpeoplestandisfacismnotpatriotism #VetsAgainstTrump

Kim Jong Un has recently been talking to Vladamir Putin and Bashar al-Assaud. Guess Kim's only friends are other despots. Birds of a feather. Mr. President @realDonaldTrump please be vigilant when you meet Kim Jong Un. Do not let him play you. (Trust no one)

If @realDonaldTrump pardons Manafort it will add to his obstruction of justice and abuse of power. We have to make the Republicans fear us more than fear their base. Let's figure out how to do that. Me importantly we have to vote them out. We need more offense.

So, if @realDonaldTrump seriously thinks it was us Canadians who burned down the White House in 1812, I think he needs to go back and take a History lesson. Canada was not even a country until 1867. Some may have been future Canadians, but thats about it.
Here's the thing @realDonaldTrump . You exhibit all the classic signs of an abuser, and I'm not going to be bullied into not caring if your wife disappears again. You're fucking crazy and I don't trust you. You hear?
@realDonaldTrump Barron probably could've told you that. Damn.
Perhaps North Korea will cancel the summit again. With such an insult, I would tell @realDonaldTrump to go f**k himself.

@realDonaldTrump You are an idiot. I don't have to convince anyone: everyone can see it. I'm not particularly enamoured of my Prime Minister, but your remarks are indicative of the need for termination of your life, as you obviously have nothing valuable to offer the species.
#BestThingAboutThe70s is corrupt, lying, conman @realDonaldTrump was not president!
Trump backs out of G7 agreement, lashes out at 'meek and mild' Justin Trudeau for 'dishonest' press conference https:// washex.am/2kYAVGD @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @MichaelDelauzon @AmbJohnBolton
Idiotic popular vote argument again. @realDonaldTrump spent a fraction of the money the incompetent crooked dimrat candidate did and crushed the electoral vote which is the only thing that matters and what he campaigned for. 1st downs and hits don't matter, only the score does.
Seems @realDonaldTrump and @USAGSessions are trying to punish people who seek asylum. Trump and Sessions should be held accountable for their deadly vindictive policies.

It amazes me that supposedly intelligent people like Navarro dont watch anything but Fox news. Trudeau and many other government representatives have said for a couple weeks that the actions of @realDonaldTrump were insulting. Many news stations have broadcast those comments
God help US if @JohnBrennan 's concept of America returns. We barely survived you and your ilk's dream of a globalist one world order. You have been defeated, Mr. Brennan. Thank God for @realDonaldTrump
real @lopezobrador_ (El Peje) is asking for a reunion with @realDonaldTrump , but he says that Donald must certify that he will respect him. We must advice that El Peje is acting as if he is already the mexican president (but is not). @nytimes @CarlosLoret @aguilarcamin

And by the way, @realDonaldTrump is undermining his own thirst for a legacy here - without the documentary record, there will be no basis for reevaluating contemporary judgments of the administration.
Jonah Goldberg goes so way over the top with his @realDonaldTrump bashing that Chris Wallace even chuckles - they all know that they are full of shit yet they persist, very telling. #FNS

@FoxNewsSunday Mr. Wallace you are soooo bias regarding @Potus that it pains me to even try to watch your coverage. If your guest says anything positive about @realDonaldTrump you go on to what ever you can use to give a negative. Not helpful at all in reporting news.
Hey... Didn't Barack Obama do that very same thing? Smile to @realDonaldTrump 's face and then do everything he could to go against him and subvert every move? Hmm ... #GlobalismWillKillUsAll

@HuntsmanAbby probably needs to be more careful w/her comments. If @realDonaldTrump were a dictator, all of us would be in a world of hurt.
@realDonaldTrump is right: There should be 0 tariffs by any country. @SenJohnMcCain doesn't like Trump fighting who have been imposing tariffs and/or banning certain USA products for decades. Allies should be treating the USA as an ally. They and McCain are hypocrites.
@JustinTrudeau Build that wall Justin. Keep the wanker @realDonaldTrump out
