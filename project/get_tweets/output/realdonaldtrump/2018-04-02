. @realDonaldTrump Look at $50,000.00 fee per employee per year 4 hiring illegal. Call it fee or fine or tax. Should help get rid of all them on their own. Have IRS collect it and ICE write the tickets to employers. Food for thought! @seanhannity @GovMikeHuckabee @marklevinshow
The U.S. Prez just used a double negative. #GRAMMAR RT @realDonaldTrump : Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through thr Southern Border, and... into U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws.... big drug and people flows...

@realDonaldTrump Trump, when are you going to bring in the white South African refugees that are being murdered? Can't do it because they're conservative and would vote against globalist agenda! Be a man and give them and Christians being murdered a place in America!
@realdonaldtrump 's personal vendettas are clouding his judgement, impeachment proceedings should be filed immediately. He's become a loose cannon. It's time he gets out of the way of our progress as a nation. #resign or be #impeached the choice is yours Trump. We're done with u.

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, Since the fake news and Dems are constantly at war with you may I suggest major weekly TV peeches from the WH/Oval Office, direct news to the American people. Like fireside chats done by former Presidents. Use the bully pulpit, no news folks there!
Kind of makes you look like the Uneducated ZERO credibility fool that is spreading lies on twitter. The exact fools that @realDonaldTrump & infowars #NRA need to survive and make money from!

Russian influence campaigns that use the hashtag #IstandwithLaura spiked 2,800 percent over the weekend. No surprise at all that @foxnews is in the same pocket and has the same supporters as their venerated diety @realdonaldtrump .
The only reason @realDonaldTrump wanted to be president is because he was the victim of an impromptu roast hosted by @BarackObama at the correspondence dinner and he felt the need to have people take him serious. Mission failed Mr. #FakePresident !
@realDonaldTrump is still a pathological liar.

@realDonaldTrump Sir, maybe now is the time to start using the military to protect our borders. A deployment to the areas of the border that are hard to patrol, might, show your intent to keep our borders safe and would make Congress finally realize that you mean business.
@realDonaldTrump at what point are you coming on TV tonight to take responsibility for the market drop? I believe you once said the president is to blame.
@realDonaldTrump The time is over due to take control of the DOJ, the Mueller witch hunt, the FBI, our border, our trade policies, criminal sanctuary cities & a corrupt Republican congress that needs to be called out & named by U as subversives out to block the America 1st agenda
@realDonaldTrump tweeted,"They say niggers draw heat, so why is it so friggin cold in DC, you know there are tons of niggers here. Not so many at Mar-a-Lago, in fact we don't allow niggers there!!"

Trump has possibly played more golf and spent more of our tax dollars traveling to his resorts than Obama did in 8 years!!! @realDonaldTrump is the most corrupt @potus in our history!!
