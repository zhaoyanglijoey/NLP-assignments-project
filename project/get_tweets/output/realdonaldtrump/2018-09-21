Pretty sure Trump isn't stupid! Turds float, rats scurry, roaches scatter! @POTUS knows when to pull the plug or flush the toilet! God bless @realDonaldTrump ! pic.twitter.com/DjwqPf9d1S
@realDonaldTrump needs to fill Honda Center
@POTUS44 Bahahahaha is exactly right Laura! Obama is a lost cause and he is struggling to accept that Trump destroyed his legacy the day he was elected! Awesome! Pure awesome! #TrumpTrain ! This is their last stand and they will lose again! #Trump2020 @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President. Why the hell don't you fire Rosenstein?
NYT Story was concocked by Trump Allies with sources that weren't even in the room. Irresponsible Reporting. Probably a Disguised @realDonaldTrump Call. Won't be the first time Assault Enabler.
@realDonaldTrump Dude, if you're so worried about being removed via the 25th Amendment, STOP BEING A FUCKING PSYCHO
Rosenstein was part of the whole FISA Court application process to spy on @realDonaldTrump campaign! Of course he's interfering and wants Trump declared unfit! He's protecting his own ass!!
@realDonaldTrump denagrating a woman's character to the public he doesn't know, then I saw a COMMERCIAL about and for the judge! What does that do?
AMEN! When STUPID, . @realDonaldTrump , Shows HIS IGNORANCE about Education, he proves how valuable it is, cause without his Crooked Actions with #Russia_Putin , he would not be potus. He's Plain Dumb. #VoteBluetoSaveAmerica
Civil Rights Violation. If anyone can bust this monopoly its @RealJamesWoods . Nationalize this utility @realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk @greggutfeld @marklevinshow @LouDobbs
@realDonaldTrump is trying to explain something that he has experienced. "Why did it take so long to come forth?" He has to only speak to the women he has assaulted and probably get an answer he still would deny. @MaddowBlog @Lawrence it sounds odd for him to speak about this.
@realDonaldTrump Accuser of Kavanaugh's been barking about wanting FBI to investigate; so start there investigating her flight records; when did she last take a flight. She asked for it so give it to her. Might discover false statement being made.
#WhyIDidntReport Because of men like you @realDonaldTrump , quick to dismiss, belittle, degrade, & make life hell for females like me who DO REPORT. It's a predators signature move, a strategy, to shut down a victim, keep your ass out of jail to abuse again
Ha! Of course - The Fabian Society!! So obvious - right in front of our faces all the time! @@realDonaldTrump
Wow only @OANN is playing @realDonaldTrump rally.
@JRubinBlogger why don't you go after @keithellison with the same vigor you attack @realDonaldTrump over #KarenMonohan who can actually produce evidence and witnesses Ellison attacked her? #ConfirmKavanaugh

Dear @realDonaldTrump , We the people voted you into office, and you're doing a great job! But we need you to stop playing footsy with the lunatic left! You are the President, so hold their feet to the fire! Make them release the documents now! The world is watching and it's time!
It's time for @realDonaldTrump to fire Rosenstein he is trying to take down an elected President of the United States. #Sedition #25thAmendment pic.twitter.com/2NDlsfvz75
Watching Livestream of @realDonaldTrump Rally .....since FOX isn't showing "in toto" ????????????
So @realDonaldTrump is at a rally in MO and I am watching COMMERCIALS?? @FoxNews Why don't you just come out and say you are turning into liberals.
you already got @realDonaldTrump who has many many credible accusations about misconduct and he ( @realDonaldTrump ) backed a child molester too. @GOP you just want to add to the list?
Despicable you @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump is doing an exceptional job as our President and I think Ted Cruz would have done a great job too. The only two candidates I took seriously .
@realDonaldTRump had "very good & interesting" meetings with #KimJungUn in #NK and #Putin in #Helsinki . Both of which the content even #45's top brass officials STILL have zero idea what transpired. The only "transcript" is whatever drivel drools down from #TRump 's false lips.

Besides the obvious, which is great time at Trump rally, the biggest take from last night in Vegas was real enthusiasm by Trump/America supporters vs agony/misery from the protestors. These people are unhappy and miserable PERIOD. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama #PrayforHollywood
@realDonaldTrump How much will the War You are creating with Iran Cost the taxpayer?
Change to CSPAN2, they are covering the Presidents rally!! Damm @FoxNews !!! @realDonaldTrump #maga
How many women have come forward and accused @realDonaldTrump of sexually attacking them?They have been called liars. I have lost count. He and many of these men in power have no clue of what type of real courage it takes to face your attacker and have people attack the victim.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump you might want to notice the people in the background

#MarthaMacCallum in any universe do you think that #FoxNews viewers want to miss @realDonaldTrump in order to listen to #JessicaTarlov verbal diarrhea - insanity
Only the insanity of @realDonaldTrump could make me agree with anything Obama says. In this instance, I wholeheartedly agree!
@realDonaldTrump fake news At it highest
#WhyIDidntReport heartbreaking and enraging. Get a clue @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @OrrinHatch
Well, @seanhannity told him @realDonaldTrump to declassify the documents. Trump never read them nor had any idea what they said. He was listening to his top adviser!
The Democratic Party is in shambles. They have ignored the blue-collar men and women of this great country for too long. @realDonaldTrump gave them a voice #MAGA
@marthamaccallum @FoxNews why are you not showing the Trump Rally @realDonaldTrump
Also, he supports the idiotic tariffs @realDonaldTrump has stuck on all of us. WTF?
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @nikkihaley This guy has said it all (watch the video). You know exactly what is going on in Venezuela. When are you going to take action? And I mean ACTION! SAD! If Reagan were the president he would have taken care of it https:// youtu.be/XOJlCUee7Js
@realDonaldTrump ple trump quickly.i am die.i have no time.i believe you.problem my life and death.ple ple ple quickly.ple
How in the hell did Barack H. O get 6% that man tried to destroy ur nation and in my opinion committed Treason @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity

For All Tweeting Fire Sessions ! Fire Rosenstein ! STOP STEP BACK -Read Between The Lines That NYT Story Was Planted - A Ploy To Trigger @realDonaldTrump Into Firing Them - In Order To Build Their Case Of Obstruction Of Justice Need I Say More
Laura can't read between the lines. If @realDonaldTrump doesn't get what he wants he already said he would release it. After 2 years it's the same old thing with these people.
This is what a real leader looks like @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN common...its the pop corn industry causing these circuses with lobbyists! I'm sure their revenue has gone up 1000 %!
Is @realDonaldTrump not up to the task? Seems he's being taken at every level. Sad. Low IQ. Low energy.
@ChuckGrassley @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The background on the Ford conspiracy to get rid of Kavanaugh & Gorsuch keeps coming out! It's been a set up all along
No, Mr. President do not fire Rosenstein, allow his boss, Jeff Sessions, to do it. This way if Sessions does we will know something about him. If he doesn't that will tell us more. @realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters @LouDobbs @IngrahamAngle
A beloved family member was assaulted and wouldn't go to the police because she was afraid of just this reaction. She will NEVER be the same. @realDonaldTrump is too shallow to understand. Sad little man.

@FoxNews stop showing Martha and show our PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump
@Susan4Senate ask president Trump to come to Washington State! @realDonaldTrump
Seems extremely beneficial to @realDonaldTrump at a time where he wants nothing more than to get rid of Jeff Sessions. What Better way than to slander DAG, replace him with a loyalist and fire AG sessions knowing DAG will be acting AG. This story provides him and gop cover.
Yep! @realDonaldTrump supporters are re-enrolling to be accepted into the prestigious Trump University. Believe me!
Sad. Unless a miracle happens #BrettKavanaugh or some other @GOP #HeritageFoundation , #FederalistSociety #Evangelicals nominee will be the 9th @Scotus justice while @realDonaldTrump is in office. Impacting laws for generations impacting women, health, race and presidential power.
@realDonaldTrump Wait until after the elections. Please!!
.You'd think @realDonaldTrump , of all people, would know what law enforcement agency handles rape cases. (It's not the FBI.)
@realDonaldTrump the reason she didnt go to the police earlier is the same reason your child victims didnt call the authorities after you raped them-fear.
@HawleyMO You are knocking it out of the arena with @realDonaldTrump tonight. You will be the next Senator from the show me state.
You did it again @FoxNews ! Why do you insist on muting our President during the @realDonaldTrump rally in Springfield??
You know when #Brexit is going bad, that you decide news-binge the madness of @realDonaldTrump to take your mind off problems from home.

@realDonaldTrump how long has your daughter Ivanka been in denial on grabs you did to her? All the comments you made if not my daughter I would marry her, doesn't she have great breasts, telling a porn star you look like my daughter. We have all seen the photos of you and her
#WhyIDidntReport @realDonaldTrump because of you people like YOU that believe a woman is only violated if she notifies authorities IMMEDIATELY after
Antifa faction @RedGuardsLA proudly hanging an effigy of our great President @realDonaldTrump . Not to mention setting fire to numerous American flags. Would you find any of this as "Instances that promoted hate", @PayPal ? @Twitter @Dan_Schulman @DHSgov @steph93065 pic.twitter.com/8dWMundnMb
You think you're doing good, but in a few years, either your husband or @realDonaldTrump will cut one of your fingers off for reading the bible in public.
@LouDobbs we want to hear and see EVERY WORD of @POTUS rallies! @realDonaldTrump where can we see? We also want to hear every candidate you are supporting!!!?
This "Leak" from Rosenstein is a @GOP #HitJob ! Its smells of t @HouseGOP , specifically tht of #JordanNunesPaulAndMedows ! Its an excuse 3 #DonaldDump @realDonaldTrump 2 try & invoke a #SaturdayNightMassacreTwo & tht #BigDummy wil take it & eun wth it. #SMDH t @GOP r #Shameless
Not surprising, since @realDonaldTrump raped a 13yo girl. #TrumpRapes
Missouri loves you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @HawleyMO !
The crowd is fired up in Springfield Missouri for the @realDonaldTrump rally
Why are you talking over our President on @FoxNews television !!!!! Ridiculous!!!!! I turned you off & listen to @realDonaldTrump at Right Side Broadcasting on YouTube #TrumpRally #MAGA
Wow. Only the *best* people appointed by @realDonaldTrump in his administration. #SaveOurCountry
@realDonaldTrump ignore everything. Wait until after midterms. Patience. @ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC #Deplorablesvote #RedWaveRising
Because the 2 other countries helped in the spying on @realDonaldTrump he knows it all
@realDonaldTrump brings #JoshHawley @HawleyMO on stage! #Springfield #MO #JQHArena #MAGA

@foxnews cutting away from the @realDonaldTrump rally again. Finished with you, you have numerous anchors that bleet out the same crap over and over...we want to hear directly from @POTUS while he is giving a rally. #maga #cspan2 goodbye @FoxNews
@CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost @NBCNews All of these liberal media don't like economy is getting better. If they do why don't they report about this rising economy. Instead they look for something negative about @realDonaldTrump Trump every single day.
@realDonaldTrump RALLY ON OANN. DIRECTV 347
Confused as to how/ why this would be a problem if true. He wanted to collect evidence to remove the horrible disgrace of an incompetent sociopath, @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump Get on Offense; not Defense with Kavanaugh accuser. Have FBI investigate TSA flight records. When did accuser last fly? It could prove to be a false statement by her she doesn't like to fly. Stall job.
Fox now is not covering fully @realDonaldTrump rally in Missouri. Fox was the only TV channel where we could watch @realDonaldTrump , not longer we now have to rely on fake news to learn what is going on in USA
@FoxNews @marthamaccallum have decided to yap over @POTUS . I tuned in to listen to @realDonaldTrump and wish the rest of you would stop gas bagging
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Has anyone thought that this is a tactic to get @POTUS to fire DAG? For more negative talking points ? #DrainTheSwamp #Hannity
@foxandfriends @FoxNews Once again, I had to change the channel from Fox to C-SPAN 2. Martha did not want to let us watch the Missouri Rally without talking through it. Shame on you Fox! @marthamaccallum @realDonaldTrump @VP @PressSec @seanhannity

@MikeTokes , another right wingnut fawning over the worse US president in history, @realDonaldTrump .
My father raped me for 3 years after I turned 12, and I am now 50, I JUST told my family a month ago. @realDonaldTrump you can go screw yourself
Pretty sure daddy @realDonaldTrump has been there with @IvankaTrump . It will be years before she speaks out about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father @realDonaldTrump . Yeah he f_____d her.
As new revelations further unfold with this Administration-could Pres. Trump's @realDonaldTrump possible downfall come from within???
Oh don't worry! Macho Man @realDonaldTrump deleted it. Must've gotten an earful from @KellyannePolls . So see? It never happened! All is GREAT! Black employment something wet storm something.

On @OANN channel instead of @FoxNews , so I can watch @realDonaldTrump #MissouriRally and @HawleyMO UNINTERRUPTED by repetitive Fox coverage on bogus #Kavanaugh accusations.
@FoxNews @marthamaccallum You give us clueless, squeaky and dishonest @Tarlov and don't show the entire @realDonaldTrump rally?? Sure glad I have youtube so we don't have to be subjected to her.
Beto said he'd vote TO-DAY to impeach @POTUS @realDonaldTrump . I'll just #VetoBeto instead. Nothing about him represents Texas. For the love of Texas #KeepTexasRed #Vote2018 #Cruz2018 @tedcruz
