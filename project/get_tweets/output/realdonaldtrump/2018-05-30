This is why @realDonaldTrump never apologizes, especially, when he knows he's wrong.
@realDonaldTrump you are such a role model for indecency and deception. No wonder your wife left you.
Hey would you want to be seen with a racist all the time? @FLOTUS - Tell @realDonaldTrump to call out Roseanne Barr for her racial comments. Is #BeBest over?
@tedcruz should be replaced. He is poor in gun control, poor on immigration, poor in racial harmony and diversity, poor in race relations. Above all, his inconsistent approach on the excesses of the @realDonaldTrump admin is worrying. @MSNBC @GOP @SenateGOP @congressdotgov

@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Barzini will move against u 1st. He'll set up a meeting with some1 that u absolutely trust guaranteeing ur safety. At that meeting, you'll be assassinated... Now listen, whoever comes to u with this Barzini meeting, he's the traitor (spy: Sessions).
@realDonaldTrump how many rts to get a small loan of a million dollars #helpme #out #bro

@realDonaldTrump 's reaction to roseanne cancellation, "that's nothing, I don't even need ambien to be a racist"
@realDonaldTrump Sir,you need to send the marines in on the fib to stop them
@realDonaldTrump Famous Chinese saying may I live in Interesting times Trump is a one man miracle everyday he lifts the standards bar higher and higher May G D Bless and keep President Trump healthy happy strong wise full of life to 120 years ...a very famous Jewish saying :)
@realDonaldTrump Last month consumer spending rose 1% Lowest in five years. Corporate profits up over 8%. Those tax cuts are working as you planned. Corporations get rich. Middle class and poor get crap. You failed again. Traitor AND a failure too. pic.twitter.com/T73OlYaY61
California on the rise! meeting our candidate@JoinTravisAllen is to our benefit @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump maga
I can imagine right now that @realDonaldTrump is becoming VERY personally interested in "prison reform and sentencing".
hahaha I could care less if they hammer me... one reason I love @realDonaldTrump is because our personalities are almost identical
@PressSec Sarah Sanders claims that @realDonaldTrump deserves an apology ... Ok, well here goes: "I am sorry you're a racist Nazi." Phew ... it felt good to get that off my chest ...
Then why did @realDonaldTrump say he would raise the age?
@Tennessean how can anyone who is educated and well read support @realDonaldTrump when he lies and lies and lies. (To say nothing of his moral depravity) Says a lot about Tennessee and its residents.
Double Standard. We love Roseanne and we Love POTUS. We hate fake news, and crybaby Libtards. #BOYCOTTABC #BoycottDisney #IStandWithRoseanne #CancelTheView @realDonaldTrump @DNC @ABCNetwork @WaltDisneyCo @ABCPolitics @ABC @therealroseanne pic.twitter.com/sKeXXNnysH
Of course @realDonaldTrump races to defend the lady who once grabbed her crotch while singing the national anthem.
Fits @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump to a "T".
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mike how many strikes is to many before you realize that a criminal is not going to change? 3 appears to be a lot. You may not be afraid of a drug user but I've seen them desperate & hurt ppl. Case by case ok.
. @pjstar #GOP_hypocrisy MT @MJGerson "A political, moral & religious failure of massive, discrediting proportions" *dehumanization of migrants & refugees is one of the most consistent themes of @realDonaldTrump *
LOL @realDonaldTrump ...you sure can pick 'em! No gambler in the country would take that horse now! How's it feel Dan.. knowing the big looser got ya back?!!
The interesting part of the story is that you 'estimated' the crowd size.. Lol...did you eyeball it ?? Lol. Thought journalist write based on fact. Just proves @realDonaldTrump 's point, dishonest, biased click bait drive-by media
I for one give you credit for your apology, but you know you cannot unsay what you said. Everyone has said something they regret at some time. Unfortunately your buddy @realDonaldTrump will have labelled you a loser for apologizing. If only he had the balls to apologize.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump HOPE? Well said Governor. You just used the one word that is literally fueling all divides in this Country. I am currently writing a book about this and how it has killed Hope and Ruined lives. I am also writing a letter to President Trump.
Un-fucking-believable.... ?!?!?! Where did our nation go, and how much worse can it get under president shit for brains @realDonaldTrump ?!?! #DonTheCon #MAGA #trainwreck #VoteOutGOP
WTF? Kim Kardashian met with @realDonaldTrump today to discuss prison reform. What next? Mickey Mouse discussing international nuclear disarmament with him? This White House is a joke! pic.twitter.com/VPxgplVP5B
The moment when working American families are dreaming of getting a fair shake from the corrupt @GOP & @realDonaldTrump , and not being screwed again! And that moment is November! Vote corrupt @GOP out!
@realDonaldTrump Hello, Thank you for what you are doing, but there is always room for improvement for when it comes to the news. I feel there must be a brake down of monopoly fake media & news channels that are on the USA air waves. So uninform Voters can be educated w/real News pic.twitter.com/cGQ6vMLOYt
@realDonaldTrump tell me the convo with Kim word by word
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec
@FoxNews really tryin 2 equate wht otha ppl said against @therealroseanne racist rant? Wow.. Nstead of tht @realDonaldTrump & @seanhannity on tha #CohenTapes
I see. Melanie has kidnapped FLOTUS and @realDonaldTrump is writing the ransom note.
This is a great watch regarding the @therealroseanne situation. @ABC @abcnews @ABCNetwork @ABCWorldNews @ABCPolitics @abc @realDonaldTrump #Roseanne #RoseanneCancelled #Roseannetweet #RoseanneTheRacist
@realDonaldTrump go back to whatever it was you did before??? Kardashian, are you kidding me? White house is a swamp.... #trump
So @therealroseanne comes out as a racist, homophobic, and mysogynist, and "SURPRISE" gets fired. Meanwhile, the racist, homophobic, mysogynist dirtbag @realDonaldTrump that inspired her is still employed. Welcome to America.
Do you people actually believe @realDonaldTrump -and his lapdogs Gorka, Hannity, and Ingraham-know more about FBI investigations than @TGowdySC ? LMAO! Gowdy's seen ALL non-redacted documents and has YEARS of experience w/the DOJ as US Atty and is undefeated as a Prosecutor. pic.twitter.com/ZxcRO2i2HB
BIEN DICHO SR: PRESIDENTE@EPN SI EL PRESIDENTE @realDonaldTrump quire un muro lo mas justo es que EL MISMO SE LO PAGUE
@realDonaldTrump says MS13 and NP says he said all immigrants. For the love of Pete! I'm surprised @NancyPelosi didn't get dizzy & fall from that huge spin.
Sometimes you just need to take your camera for a walk and enjoy a little bit of Gods wonderful creations! Counting blessings for this amazing President & His administration... @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @FLOTUS Thank you all for all you do for all of us!!! pic.twitter.com/eltX30a3Pp
@Katebolduan @juliehdavis @CNN Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) couldn't win the #Repulican primary without help; Trump would not be where he is without herculean help; the evidence is in his performance thus far e.g. #Mexico will not pay for border #wall #NAFTA is intact I
#IWillApologizeWhen @realDonaldTrump apologizes to immigrants, women, journalists, Puerto Rico, the Constitution and releases his tax records...

Truth is @realDonaldTrump could do everything that you haters wanted then you would find something else to nag
No way she wrote that tweet. I'll bet the national debt, @realDonaldTrump wrote it.

#Nazi #Zionist #IDF #Gestapo trying to out-do the #Nazi #German #Holocaust savages? For #Enemies of the State of #Israel (protesters of brutality), it's open season. Tragic, & @realDonaldTrump seems to approve of #Israel eliminating the #Palestinian #humanity . #WhitePrivilege
Watch your pussy @KimKardashian @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Traitor
Brilliant idea. I hope @realdonaldtrump follows up with this Sec. Pampeo
@realDonaldTrump will prove them wrong once again!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe Kim K. is irrelevant, but she is a slice of America. Thus, she is not deplorable. She matters.....somewhat.
Excellent work Donnie .... Next week, Honey Boo Boo will discuss School Safety with @realDonaldTrump .... "a well oiled machine"
No problem Mr. Fox. @realDonaldTrump will be going to prison soon.
@realDonaldTrump is amazing!!
@realdonaldtrump , do you still think your response to Puerto Rico was a 10? You should be ashamed. But I realize that you have no shame, so I will be ashamed of and for you. #PuertoRico
He was obviously asked how @realDonaldTrump is still President. #NotMyPresident
Well, . @PressSecSanders , shall we talk re . @realDonaldTrump double standard on golf ( Obama = bad for 37 rounds in 500 days. Trump = no comment re: golfing 102 times in 493 days)? Or the double standard re insecure email accounts (Clinton = bad, @EPAScottPruitt = no comment)?

@realDonaldTrump did the same thing over and over that Roseanne did,he needs to get his racist ass out the White House and he can take his bulldog Sarah Sanders with him and the rest of them puppets. #RacistRoseanne #RacistTrump
Oh my goodness, how this warms the heart @realDonaldTrump . Thank you for being such a compassionate President.
There is no one to better represent a bunch of fucking morons than @realDonaldTrump
@realdonaldtrump WINNING !~! US Marines kill more than 70 Taliban leaders in Afghanistan https:// fxn.ws/2sj3t1G #FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump and Kim Kardashian are quite a fitting pair....tRump will soon be an expert on prisons...if you know what I mean!
Ratings were falling fast after @realDonaldTrump endorsement. You just gave them an excuse to pull the plug with a dumb tweet.
