On behalf of our blowhard in charge, allow me and many Americans to say how very sorry we are for your loss. @realDonaldTrump has no shame, no class, no sense of decency. #HurricaneIrma #HurricaneMaria
The response that @realDonaldTrump gave to #PuertoRico was only a photo shoot tossing paper towels to soak up the water and nothing more. This is what #trump wants for #Americans . It's time to end the tyranny of this #GOP administration. Don't Hiss, Don't Boo. #VOTE #Election2018
#GOPCorruption #GOPComplicit @realDonaldTrump #NoKavanaughConfirmation A man is known by the company he/she keeps
As per @hardball @realDonaldTrump is the "Babe Ruth Of BS"...
I do not agree with the impatient, demanding tone of this Anon. Q and @realDonaldTrump depend on the various internet platforms even more than we do. President Trump IS WITH US! We still #TrustThePlan AND it's timing as we do NOT know all of the dynamics behind the scenes.

WaPo says @realDonaldTrump has reached the milestone of FIVE THOUSAND LIES since inauguration.
Sen Feinstein insinuated Brett Kavanaugh could be guilty of a crime. What crime? This drunken Witch has no Soul nor Integrity. She needs to be expelled from the Senate. Kavanaugh is the best America has and Feinstein is the worst. #@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @PressSec @FoxNews pic.twitter.com/n4GpFqOvxv
@realDonaldTrump is the literally the most honorable and honest president since Lincoln. Point out one thing he has done to dishonor the office? Obama crapped all over it!
Dear #NY , the last time #Americans ' #voted for #change ,' just because they wanted it, we ended up with @realDonaldTrump . #Minnesota ended up with #JesseVentura . The #GOP doesn't have a monopoly on #inexperienced wack-a-doodles who talk a big game.
All @realDonaldTrump had to do for Hurricane Maria was call ret. Lt-Gen Russel Honore who directed operations during Katrina. He didn't have the brains to do that.

I am a strong supporter of @realDonaldTrump . I believe he is the only President to live up to campaign promises. BUT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT HE SHOULD CLARIFY HIS COMMENTS REGARDING DEATHS IN PUERTO RICO. IT SHOULD BE ON TWITTER FOR ALL PEOPLE TO READ.
@ezraklein @realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel @pdoocy For Kavanaugh 2 be confirmed, he must have majority of votes & President & Party that confirms him will only be unpopular 2 the party who lost the last election. Thankfully, USA avoided catastrophe in 2016!

@realDonaldTrump hope you have your next SCOTUS nominee ready as RBG might announce her retirement soon.
Lol @realDonaldTrump lied over 5000 times so far HAHAHAHA fuckin ass
I had someone correct me just today. I called him "Donald" and this guy says, "PRESIDENT Trump!". I said, "No. It's BARELY Donald." He gets, and deserves, absolutely no respect. The only thing @realdonaldtrump deserves is ridicule, scorn, removal from office, and prison.
@realDonaldTrump though,how can you be a president of a country n yet not be able to speak its tongue???
@realDonaldTrump Piss off, traitor.

There is no question that all of those 3000 people did not die from the hurricane. Truth is 90% of them would have died anyway, even if there wasn't a hurricane at all. DIRTY TRICKS AND MORE ATTACKS BY FAKE NEWS & CROOKED DEMS @realDonaldTrump #TRUMP
Come on John don't be a fucking 'dumbell' I'd still bet ya with yer bird like build against #dictatorinthemaking @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump If I click on a link to your tweet outside of the twtr platform in youtub, youtub stalls me with a question if I want to leave to go to your site. I dont recall it doing this for other sites...but I could be wrong.
@realDonaldTrump you got to do something
Pres Birther @realDonaldTrump : DSM 5 sociopath. Impairment in empathy, personality traits, interactions, cognition, impulse control, affect, disruptive behavior in occupational and social situations. Sound familiar? Apologize for the Birther lie. Petty little liar.
@realDonaldTrump has anyone told you about the gas explosions in Massachusetts? 3 towns with explosions. Why is there no news coverage ?
Ignorant is way to nice. @realDonaldTrump is stupid, cruel, a malignant narcissist, sociopath and psychopath.
Am I supposed to follow @realDonaldTrump ? Because I don't want to listen to his garbage, but I do want to tell him denying the #PuertoRicoDeathToll is repugnant, disrespectful, & harmful to the nation. Can't wait for a #TrumpSupporter to tell me, "But 3k people didn't die!"
Instead of enjoy the fruits of our labor in Unison as Americans and Future Americans and Farewell to those that choose to become citizens of other nations. Be well my friends. Viva @realDonaldTrump SAVE America from their cold blooded hands.
@mjfree : If you have some real evidence that @realDonaldTrump is a racist you should present it otherwise you shoud just shut up! However your tweet does present evidence that YOU ARE A RACIST!
@realDonaldTrump you would never have won without the help of the @BernieSanders cult and #Putin
Great background picture. The storm is passing through! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump - you are seriously mentally ill. @gop stop this madman. @gop you are seen by the majority of Americans as the party of cheaters and traitors.

@TalibKweli thank God for @realDonaldTrump and we got rid of the worst Prez in history Obama. You must want millions back on food stamps. Minorities to have high unemployment again. High taxes again. Ocare disaster. We now have the greatest economy in history
Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his tax returns.
Not surprising you gloss over the fact he was caught lying to the committee, more than once. i mean, that's normal for the dotard @realDonaldTrump (over 5000 documented lies since taking office) family and administration.
@realDonaldTrump money and power, but shit for brains...
Is it bad for a @yankees fan to like the @RedSox manager Alex Cora? Just saying BECAUSE I do. @ac13alex is from my part of #PuertoRico and stood up to bitch ass @realDonaldTrump . I have nothing but respect for the man.
@FactCheck can you please have a look into the Puerto Rico death toll claim by @realDonaldTrump ?

@realDonaldTrump 's narciccism in full view. It's sick. He's a national security threat
Due to the fact that @realDonaldTrump consistently lies to the American people on a daily basis, it is impossible to believe anything he says.

But I thought they didn't have any clean water?? Was @POTUS supposed to deliver to all the residents door to door?? Even if he did you'd say they weren't cold enough or the chopper made too much dust on delivery... I can see the freaking headlines!?!? @realDonaldTrump D/warm h20

History will just gloss over this time in an effort to forget the national embarrassment that is @realDonaldTrump
ABSOLUTELY @realDonaldTrump We Are The "Majority" Of This Country That Loves Our Country And Our Flag. It's Going To Be A Fun Next 6 & 1/2 Years...
So @realDonaldTrump and @PaulManafort are "thick as thieves"
What the #Americapeople don't see in this chaotic time is that #DonaldTrump is the "fever".. the "disease" is failed policies, #Immigration and #DCcorruption . In other words #POTUS45 is allowing this disease to cool down for rehab and restructure. #KAG2020 @realDonaldTrump #HERO
How DARE you @realDonaldTrump question the #PuertoRicoDeathToll ? You are by far the most CRUEL, DUMB, ILLITERATE, ILLEGITIMATE, FRAUD @POTUS ever. And yes I am screaming at you dumbass !
I am Percent @realDonaldTrump all the time. If you object... Don't follow. #WWG1WGA
He has taken permanent residence in you and your friends heads...while crushing the satanic side of the coin. Subverting the @POTUS is treason... Really didn't know how stupid people were until the people elected @realDonaldTrump ! You're not worried about your friends are you?

Fuck you, @realDonaldTrump . You fucking suck. Stop breathing my air.
@realDonaldTrump seeing that @Twitter has no issues with blocking free speech from conservatives then there should be no issues with you blocking whomever you want to block on your personal account. I do not see any Liberal judges telling @Twitter they can't do that.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President Twitter now allows Tweets calling for the killing of "Whites"+"Trump Supporters"(NONE resulted in the Tweeters being suspended or banned), while Twitter still very aggressively bans Conservatives+Republicans before the November elections!
Yep, the whole @gop , @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP are complicit in the bs coming from @realDonaldTrump ! Disgraceful and disgusting!
@realDonaldTrump @Queen_UK @theresa_may IF HE WILLING TO STAY IN UK ! WE MUST PROUD OF IT ! OBEY HIM GOOD GUY
Any accusation by @realDonaldTrump should be considered a confession.
Yeah, just like when he told Palestinian leader to wait because @realDonaldTrump would be out if office in a year. He needs to be tried for treason or have his passport revoked and security clearance revoked. He is undermining the @POTUS
