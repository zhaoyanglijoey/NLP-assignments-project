Cannot be true as dumb dumb Trump @realDonaldTrump stated that he provided full autonomy to FBI to investigate all relevant parties.
@DonaldJTrumpJr is irrelevant. He is just as bad if not worse than his father @realDonaldTrump
WTF , I thought we Americans had first choice . What's wrong with these CEO ? Money is more important then a strong Industrial America . @LouDobbs @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump will be jailed, he will die in prison. But tax evasion won't be the reason.
Someone must have shown Putin my Moscow presentation a couple of weeks ago. But to be fair to @realDonaldTrump , I doubt Cohn & Tillerson shared the financial part of #EnergyDominance with him
I think you all have forgotten why @realDonaldTrump wants @BrettKavanaugh on the court. If Mullers has to subpoena Trump to testify he know Kavanaugh will block the subpeona #StopKanavaugh
You even learn that concept in Finance survey classes in undergrad... Wharton never taught you that @realDonaldTrump ? SAD MFER

I am exhausted from hearing Republicans bash & question this traumatized woman's motives. I sincerely hope @realDonaldTrump , @ChuckGrassley , @PressSec , @LindseyGrahamSC and Brett Kavanaugh all rot in hell for eternity. They are despicable, vile, people without any compassion.

Ok..as I read all these comments..regardless of your opinions on @realDonaldTrump , he IS still your president! Do you live in the United States? If you answered yes, then guess what..HE IS YOUR PRESIDENT!!! If you hate him that much then move out of the country!! Problem solved!
No matter HOW RELENTLESS THE MEDIA IS ON @realDonaldTrump .. HE STANDS TALL, DEFENDS AND FIRES BACK. You think other international adversaries want to test those waters?? TRUMP: 1ST ALCOHOL FREE @POTUS ..NOW IF THIS WERE HILLARY?? SEVERAL NATIONAL EMBARASSMENTS 2 YRS IN. #MAGA
And the only 2 reasons the story is false: 1. Her boss said so 2. She has no brain of her own #FakeTrumpNews @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr President - you said the FBI isn't being limited but they can't talk to the plaintiff or the defendant who's your SCUS nominee? What kind of con-job are you trying to pull here? If you say Kavanaugh is innocent let the @FBI do their job. #Kavanaugh #trump
