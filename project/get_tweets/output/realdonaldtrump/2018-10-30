Thank you to the protesters who stood their ground and protected the mourning families not be subjected to the circus heading their way. It's hella disrespectful @realDonaldTrump to take advantage of others' pain you caused!
FLYING IN TO POPULATE & OVERWRITE A NATION IS OVER! #USA WILL NOT BE ERASED BY DROP IN POPULATIONS - Open border RINOs are the wrong people to ask about the entire globe scheduling vacations in the #USA conveniently when a baby is due to be born. @librarycongress @realDonaldTrump
Poor guy will probably be fired from Fox and attacked by @realDonaldTrump for telling the TRUTH. Only FACT he left out is there are Absolutely NO Middle Easterners in the Caravan
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @LouDobbs @foxandfriends Today I watched Smirky Judith Miller criticize our POTUS on sending the Military to the border! It's called being prepared Judith! Thank God she can only write because she sures the hell wouldn't be a good leader! Dumbass!
@realDonaldTrump you moron! You vowed to God and the United States to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States! You can't just change it!

@realDonaldTrump 0tv and C
I always believed everything @realDonaldTrump said about these 2
If accurate, the only meaningful context this can be placed in is the recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital. Much hateful rhetoric from leftists sympathetic to Palestinians. Hence @realDonaldTrump has indeed engendered such a spike; don't think it's of skew insinuated.
It's a lot worse for @realDonaldTrump then it was for Reagan.
I'm sure @realDonaldTrump will call to congratulate her. People are horrible!

@realDonaldTrump
What the fuck? Did he actually think this was at all clever? This is the logic I expect from @realDonaldTrump , not a person with a brain
Interesting that @realDonaldTrump would impose himself on this synagogue which law enforcement still considers a crime scene. I guess Trump's need for a photo-op supersedes all else. Deplorable!
Thank you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for saying @FloydMayweather would be a Great president for us in starting 2020 lol I hope he runs #easywork pic.twitter.com/wkXjqWnBOR

@realDonaldTrump I am sick and tired of fat Donnie trying to side step the14th amendment to the constitution. You are not God or king. You need to resign or be impeached. #LiarInChief #needtoimpeach
@realDonaldTrump you have caused this. The hatred you spew is vile, and it makes other disgusting people think that racism/sexism/discrimination and violence is ok. IT IS NOT OK. You are following in Hitler's footsteps and you make every rational human being sick. pic.twitter.com/Sceg39HjqM
I believe people have ample evidence to tie the rise in hate crimes (by 12% from 2016-17) to the hateful rhetoric @realdonaldtrump spews on a near daily basis. He has let the dark come into the light.
Will never happen. The @realDonaldTrump is out his mind! He hasn't a clue as to what the Constitution is. I'm waiting for this LUNATIC to try and declare Marshall Law!
This sounds a lot like "We captured the heads of ISIS" tweet from @realDonaldTrump a few months ago. #QAnon #TheGreatAwakening
Somebody help w/ understanding. So @realdonaldtrump says military deployed to border, no one getting in, but Breitbart says hes gonna do tent cities? Mark words, this IS his moment. 2020 might have just eluded him w/ this decision
OMG! look! PEEP SHOW! Bearded Lady!@realDonaldTrump @FILTHYAENIMAL @isawthat9 @realDonaldTrump @Education4Libs @5945USARTR @Tombstone1954 @TomFitton
With all these accusations going around and drama everywhere, we're not asking the real question. Who would win in a fist fight, @realDonaldTrump or #Mueller ? Find out this question and more in #covfefethegame ! (Not really though, but still check it out)
@realDonaldTrump could demand answers and documents, but he isn't doing that. We have to wonder why?
Oh! So NOW it's a big deal about something over 30 years ago?!! Puppetmaster @realDonaldTrump deflecting the heat. So busy with so many pots on the stove. You wanna keep playing America to derail the the investigation? #collusion #liar #wagthedog #Mueller

Would you please man up and kick @realDonaldTrump off Twitter for his endless hate speech?
Donald @realDonaldTrump Trump is not responsible for @JoeNBC paranoia and monomania.
The thing about the @MinnesotaDFL is that it's not the same party of the 60's & 70's when my Dad was growing up. He left the party to vote for Reagan, moved states and has prospered under the leadership of @ScottWalker & @realDonaldTrump . Today, in #MN08 voters are still leaving.
@realDonaldTrump Tell em all.....that you will accommodate fiscal policy even further to offset The Fed rate hikes at unreasonable magnitudes and pace.
@realDonaldTrump we hope you do not let one migrant into our country no matter what anyone says. Your base is asking you to keep em out
Whether or not @realDonaldTrump can even address it by EO since it's a matter of existing statute is another story. Perhaps within the confines of U.S. enclaves overseas, but I doubt it.
Donald Trump and his whole administration are in the clutches of the Israel Lobby. That being the case, I'm still trying to figure out what @realDonaldTrump has to do with anti-Semitic violence. Let me know, though.
@realDonaldTrump Your buddy @VinceMcMahon is not a #legit Trump supporter unlike me since he refuses to cancel his show in Saudi Arabia on Friday after Saudi Arabia Government killed a US Citizen. I will never watch @WWE again.
@realDonaldTrump hi mr. President I love U I found a good scriptur in Proverbs 24 verse 5 & 6 says a wise man is strong yes a man of knowledge increases in strength for by wise counsel you will wage your own war and in a multitude of counselors there is safety thank you mr. Ptmp

@realDonaldTrump they asked you not to go... but your disrespecting ass doesn't give a fuck.
This @GOP , party of @realDonaldTrump , has no bottom.
Let's see how @SpeakerRyan reacts when @realDonaldTrump signs the Executive Order before we give him any credit. He 0-for 2 years so far.
Madeleine Albright-WARNS @realDonaldTrump Convinced voters in the right states that he was a blunt TRUTH teller. Masterful negotiator Champion of American interests He is none of those things. Most frightening- TRUMP is the first antidemocratic president in modern U.S. history
POTUS can and should adjudicate the precise meaning of the #14th_Amendment and the meaning of "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in the #SupremeCourt Go @realDonaldTrump ! #cocainemitch - #respect pic.twitter.com/3doXCrandk

In other words @AndrewGillum actually IS a thief just as @realDonaldTrump has stated. How anyone could support this crappy of a candidate amazes me. I pray he loses bigly!

Have some respect and recognize how YOU and @realDonaldTrump are contributing to a climate of hatred, dehumanization, and vilification of "the other" for political gain and at the expense of decency in this country.

I have to admit, I do not like the idea of @realDonaldTrump eliminating birth-right citizenship. I am not happy that we are letting these immigrants try and walk 1100 miles knowing the perils they face. We need to help them get here safely and process them. #MoreLoveLessHate
@elizabethforma I've been watching the debate and you keep bring up @realDonaldTrump , I'm curious are you running for Senate or President because it sounded like you were trying to debate the president without him in the room.
Absolutely, @realdonaldtrump is deranged, causing a syndrome of hatred, and domestic terrorist problems, which we can solve with the 25th Amendment!
. @realDonaldTrump Effect -- The Justice Department is reportedly investigating @realDonaldTrump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke https:// cnb.cx/2CRM7iv
. @realDonaldTrump is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the #1 issue Americans care about. The GOP is threatening to gut protections for pre-existing conditions. Dems are focused like a laser to #ProtectOurCare .
Wonder if @realDonaldTrump knows Kanye has dumped him yet?
Outstanding ! @realDonaldTrump is not messing around. Thank you Mr. President for standing up for these United States.
Jeopardy Answer 2019: @DonaldJTrumpJr "Alex, what is 'who will be the first anchor baby to be deported if @realdonaldtrump repeals the 14th Amendment?' "

Can't help but notice that there's one thing that @realDonaldTrump never does when he endorses someone for office. He NEVER tells us what that person will do for the constituents of that district. He never says anything about economic opportunity, education, or health care.
Respectfully disagree. If you are here illegally, your offspring have no right to US citizenship. On this, @realDonaldTrump is right. As usual. I will still vote for you as Menendez is a disgrace.
Am I the only one who believes @SouthPark was completely correct about @realDonaldTrump ? Like, with this whole attacking the constitution thing? Is he just like, get me out if here! I don't want to be here!

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President: After the Revolutionary War this country was the talk of Europe. Everyone was wondering where our Prosperity and Greatness came from. A European came over here to find out and this is what he said, ( his name is Alexis de Tocqueville )
Fixed it for you. President @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS will travel to Pittsburgh this afternoon to meet with family members of the victims of Saturday's anti-Semitic attack he helped instigate with his rhetoric. Be best.
We know @realDonaldTrump is just running off at the mouth. Stop reporting his every word and watch how much news comes flying out his mouth. This weekend would be EXCELLENT TIME TO IGNORE HIM. HINT HINT. HE WILL GO CRAZY BATSHIT.
You've got to say one thing about @realDonaldTrump he has exposed the dormant scum in the bottom of the white barrel. Any non white who votes for a Republican should not complain when Trump unleashes his racist desires.
Going to vote this coming Tuesday,If we get swindled again,We must not let this POS @realDonaldTrump continue to kill us & this nation,Whatever you think you need to do Do it!Please no more fucking around,I pray for a peaceful solution,but am ready for an all out confrontation.!!

We've had an African-American couple gunned down, Jews massacred in their synagogue, pipe bombs mailed out... @realDonaldTrump next move? Stop the constitutional right of others to have citizenship when they're born here. Minorities being targeted again, again, again, again...
@realDonaldTrump is the Very first president of the Divided States of America. #DSA
@realDonaldTrump I think Dems may be using WELFARE/HealthCare as LEVERAGE to get people to campaign for them... IF true, isn't this illegal? I have no way to look into this myself.
@realDonaldTrump legitimate friends,mourners in Pittsburgh had to move to make room for YOU...You, who inspired all this violence. Shame is the only thing you should feel. I hope somewhere in your deepest parts you can feel guilt and shame! Please-tweet your resignation.

@RepSwalwell how irresponsible for you to say something like that. Both the @GOP and @DNC are partially to blame for the rhetoric. I also blame the media for fanning the flames with their biased commentary. Finally, I do blame @realDonaldTrump for not toning things down some.
@realDonaldTrump Can someone get some crayons and a chalk board,"explain to Trump, he's a birthright citizenship. His family illegally came from Germany and birth him in United States. He's a birthright citizenship.
Guess what, @realDonaldTrump ; yes, you do. Have you not had a chance to read the Constitution? Put down the phone. Get to work.
LOFL!! Yeah, you tell that to the families that are being overtaxed so that @realDonaldTrump & the 1% can have their millions in tax breaks & have to get assistance to feed their families. Especially our vets & active military families #TrumpSupportersAreFuckinMorons
@realDonaldTrump Please, please stop accusing the media of being the enemy. There are too many idiots that don't know the difference between MSNBC and the local NBC station and some local reporter is going to get hurt, or worse. Please stop!!
@realDonaldTrump is there anybody in there?
@VP you are wrong. Nice legalese chat speach but you are wrong. Read the 14th amendment. And maybe read it with @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump you are treating our country, this election and the immigration issue like a reality show. You don't care about anything or anyone but yourself.
Constitution does not confer citizenship to children of Illegals. #USA statute Is the problem. The @Scotus has never ruled on It and If they did @realDonaldTrump would win. The practice Is ridiculous on Its face. @WhiteHouse
@realDonaldTrump You didn't mind birthright citizenship when your Russian friends wanted in on the deal. #Hypocrite #Liar #RussianAsset #PutinsPoodle
@realDonaldTrump #Putin @GOP will stoop to anything to stay in power! Talk about a totalitarian fascist pigs!
@POTUS @RealDonaldTrump "End Birthright Citizenship"?? You had no problem giving citizenship to that gold digging porn hag that you married...her chain migrating parents and her sister!! Who the hell do you think you are?

@realDonaldTrump @DanScavino , could you please keep your massa offline.
Very unprofessional to disrespectful to ignore the President @realDonaldTrump and First Lady today. Typical Democratic wonder why country is divided politicians like Bill Peduto
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for not having your head up your "butt" like so many in former administration. You actually are fully engaged in this MOST PRESSING and urgent need, unmoved by the political rhetoric. Thank you, thank you, thank.
