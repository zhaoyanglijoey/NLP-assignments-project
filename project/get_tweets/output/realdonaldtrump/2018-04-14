As a kid, I knew a neighbor a few miles away from my home. He was an irascible old guy, WWI vet & hard as nails. I would enjoy hearing him vent about our current despicable criminal @realDonaldTrump , but am glad he's not suffering through the destruction of a country he loved.
@realDonaldTrump they need to impeach yo dumb ass
Interesting there is no mention of Obama's incursion into Lybia and Egypt, or Bill Clinton's incursion into Yugoslavia in the 90's. @timkaine @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump
Nice job, @realDonaldTrump ! 8th Summit of the Americas in #Lima shows how quickly US moral leadership has collapsed on democracy and anti-corruption. Hapless @VP even lectured by #Cuba for "sacrificing" Parkland high school kids to gun lobby. https:// hrld.us/2HxT9Jr
While this is indeed good news, this would still have to pass in the House and then on to Benedict @realDonaldTrump I've no faith in him signing the bill into law which means it has to then go back to Congress for a 2/3 majority in order to override the Dotard's veto.
@GOP While you allow @realDonaldTrump to commit #ObstructionofJustice , we are happily working to #TextTheVote . Sad for you. #ProtectMueller
They are not hypocrites. They are one-sided. They hate @realDonaldTrump . They are very up front about it too. The Constitution takes a back seat to their hatred.

@realDonaldTrump "Mission Accomplished!" Really? You struck empty facilities because you tweeted out your plan, Putin WARNED Assad, he evacuated sites & chemicals. OH - G.W.Bush said those words re: Iraq /Afghanistan. How did THAT work out for him/the US?! HINT-2WARS STILL GOING!
@realDonaldTrump time to quit paying taxes all together // so you can not play these war games // if they want to kill there own people / let them / we kill our own people by what they put in our food
So are we at WWIII yet, or what's going on? #Russia #USA @realDonaldTrump please chill

Waiting on @realDonaldTrump weekly address. Looks like it's late this week.
On another subject, @VP , speaking of Putin & referring to Assad, said he'll be known BY THE COMPANY HE KEEPS. Surprising thought from a man who hangs w/ @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump @MikaBrezinski pMilitary did a great job as always. However you telegraphed to your Buddy Putin so he was prepared by removing their assets - Puppet
Hey @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/MP9mpDQ79B
Does this include the "Red Line" @realDonaldTrump says #Mueller has crossed. I get we need to help the ppl from being gassed. Why attack before the evidence was found. We reacted on "I'm Confident" & "I Believe" If that's how we work than Trump should be out of the WH now.
Because @realDonaldTrump tweeted, I just saved $[insert amount] for [insert your reason here]!
No problem IDK what was wrong with it. Wasn't even some thing I said Might of been my very first follow, @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Mr.Trump. Why do I know that there was no chemoactics in the Duma/Syria? The special services of the ANLwere forced to study the "Fake Hollywood" "w. helmets".You did not wait for the OPCW! 90% under the control of Assad and you want to save your fucking beard.

Ultimate collusion in Syria is #Russia & Putin realizing that @realDonaldTrump is in trouble @home gets Assad to spread a little chlorine around, piss off locals & give Trump excuse to bomb targets from a list supplied by the Russians! And also Tomahawks are no good unless fired

Again, there was a pall in the air during our visit, knowing that DC has been sullied by the festering sore that is the administration of @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @AmbJohnBolton Why destroy ISIS in Syria & then leave country for Assad? Are we working for Assad & doing work for him?

You're a worse liar than @realDonaldTrump ...... give it a rest comrade!
Not wanting to hurt boyfriend Putin & his pet Assad, @realDonaldTrump loudly warned them of the pending US attack through his twitter megaphone.

If he would have taken out #Assad , he'd lose all hope of stopping North Korea. As far as weak, Russia is pledged to protect Syria, and @realDonaldTrump went in there like they meant nothing. So who looks weak? Not @potus . But man does he look smart.
OK #QAnon family...I just spent a good bit of time unfollowing non-follow-backs so that I can add new WOKE friends (I've been twitter-throttled for following back for months.) Hit me up and I'll follow you back! #GreatAwakening #TheStorm #MAGA @realDonaldTrump

Hey @DiamondandSilk Here's another one for your #BowlOfStupid @ananavarro The stupidity that the FRENCH and the BRITISH would help @realDonaldTrump cover up #FakeHookerPornStarNews through COMBAT risking their soldiers' lives is LAUGHABLE and beyond #EpicFail
@realDonaldTrump @AmbJohnBolton Show real leadership by removing Animal Assad & partitioning Syria so refugee crisis ends.
Mr @realDonaldTrump , will you do something about the Saudi Arabia and the war in Yemen? The saudis funds ISIS, is that a problem for you?
Whats the best way for @realDonaldTrump to get the world off his investigation? Have missiles launched at innocent civilians.
@realDonaldTrump waiting for you to make your final mistake. Fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and that should be the end of your presidency. Each day you show the world how corrupt you and your administration is. RESGN NOW
