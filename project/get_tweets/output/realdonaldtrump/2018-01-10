Again it proves out #FireAndFury . @realDonaldTrump is not competent to hold office.
#TheBeat How anyone can be intimidated by @realDonaldTrump is ridiculous. He's an absolute insane clown. He acted like a pouty little kid making excuses in that deposition as he still does now. Love the show by the way. @AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri
@realDonaldTrump , start with a man in the mirror, who says things that are not true and still gets to pocket money.

Cutting taxes too much, as you are doing, starves the nation of vital services that the democratic majority support. Simplifying regulations denies Americans democratic regulatory protections from predators like @realdonaldtrump @realdonaldtrump is a danger to America.

@realDonaldTrump The Democrats are the ones who never keep THEIR promises of border security for amnesty!
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey Dipshit Donald, you're so repulsive even your wife won't sleep with you.
Hahahhaha hahahaha what a fool believes. Wait until @realDonaldTrump gets Russia to withdraw from Crimea and you will look like the fool you are.
I'll trust @realDonaldTrump to 'take the heat' about as well as I trust a record on a wood-burning stove to take the heat.

Wow @realDonaldTrump you're wanting you stop yourself?
@realDonaldTrump remember what JFK did to Governor Wallace when fighting desegregation and federal law? He issued Presidential Proclamation 3542 and called up the National Gaurd with executive order 11111 to enforce federal law. Why not do the same to sanctuary cities and states?

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey Dipshit Donald, you are a disgrace to the office.
@realDonaldTrump Please take into account that America is a Continent with about 30 nations. The Spanish nations are about 25. When you refer your country, say United States or USA. That is the correct form.
The court system is not broken @realDonaldTrump it protects citizens from you.

I wish I could throw my shoe at @realDonaldTrump in the face.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey Dipshit Donald, do you know how supremely stupid you looked yesterday confirming everything everyone is saying about you and your lack of fitness for office?
This negotiation will probably hurt @realDonaldTrump way more than the Fire and Fury book.

I DARE . @realDonaldTrump to produce the letters he claims he got from network anchors! (ShammityHannity @seanhannity doesn't count.) Remember the phone calls he claimed he received and Mexico's president & another country's leader said they never happened.
NO DACA..NO AMENSTY...BUILD THE WALL FROM 1986 AND ADD MORE WALL...WE THE PEOPLE ARE DONE WITH THE LIES...THATS YOU TOO MR PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls @LaraLeaTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP
OK then it is, @realDonaldTrump has created a big fat ZERO jobs.
@SenatorLankford @senJamesInhofe I believe in the FIRST AMENDMENT as the cornerstone of what's left of our democracy. NO TO @realDonaldTrump self-serving proposed libel laws.
@NBCNews I like Elizabeth back. The attorney who deposed @realDonaldTrump twice. She has phenomenal presence... I think she would be an asset to the network. #sugar

@realDonaldTrump 38 million tourists visited Mexico in 2016, so it's not exactly hell. The dreamers can work in tourism.
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump why do t you pay for it? You made a bundle through shell companies this past year. Which I bet had a huge influence on giving the wealthy a big tax break. Conning America is what you do. Own it.
@realDonaldTrump why can't we just build a gate. They're openable and protectable. They sound a lot better than a wall. Please take this to heart, have a good day/night!
Promise? DACA was never permanent. Now the @realDonaldTrump promises to clean up the mess you've created. #DACA
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey Dipshit Donald, do you even know what's in the tax bill?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, PLEASE do not back down on the wall. The past 4 decades have been nothing but lying Democrats pretending they care about border security but then never doing it. They keep tricking Republicans into supporting amnesty. NO DACA UNTIL A WALL IS BUILT!
Well good!!! @realDonaldTrump says things ALL the time he knows aren't true! Does this apply to him?!?!
FIX HEALTHCARE. SCREW DACA!! OPEN UP CAPITALISM AND LET US DO OUR THING SIR @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump cbs evening broadcast still reporting Trump flip flopped on DACA. Fake

Trump dodges on prospect of a Mueller interview @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2CYzzHb @realdonaldtrump FYI you don't get to decide. As well, the entire investigation is being run by GOP so get your facts straight.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey Dipshit Donald, a clean bill means NO FUCKING WALL.
This would be a very wise decision, BUT @realDonaldTrump lets attempt to finish a complete sentence and end one train of thought before reaching for another. This is called "flight of ideas" and IS NOT a good thing psychologically. FOCUS is needed sir and you can't find it 2 soon
@realDonaldTrump You wanna talk about Libel laws..IMPOSSIBLE..BUT, the 1st cable channel would HAVE to be FOX
@realDonaldTrump U afraid??? What happened to "I'd 100% sit down under oath and talk with Mueller"? Guess he's got a lot of shit on YOU!
