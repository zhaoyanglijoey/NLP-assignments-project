They are trying to remake their base, as @realDonaldTrump is gaining the support of American workers from their party. Lots of ex-Dems now as the D party has abandoned any pretense of patriotism & embraces far Left ideology.

@realDonaldTrump The Democrat Party represents a clear and present danger to our democracy. You sow the seeds of hatred like Obama did....the Senate is dysfunctional. McConnell, end the filibuster NOW. #SchumerShutdown
Sure, then @realDonaldTrump deals with a broken promise, that Mexico pays for the wall #PantsOnFire
Trump's first year has felt a lot longer than one year. Trump is literally slowing time and allowing us to live longer. But you'll never see the fake liberal news media give @realDonaldTrump credit for that now will you!?
@realDonaldTrump will reverse that or pay out of his own pocket, sometime #Obama would never have done! #schumershutdown #releasethememo
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is such a dangerous policy. And it only serves to give massive incentive for illegal aliens to pour through the border, and even worse, it is like a neon sign that will draw scores of criminals and possible terrorists. #SupportICE #CloseTheBorder

Your thoughts are rational, @realDonaldTrump is ignorant & self centered.
@realDonaldTrump Even if the Senate sells out the people, please stay strong on the wall, ending chain migration, e-verify. As one of your supporters, I don't want any amnesty because it just keeps happening over and over again.

Hey @realDonaldTrump People are calling him President Kelly because he seems to be in charge and you are easily led by the nose. Weak and sad!
The ONLY reason I say MAY HAVE is that there is so much evil in our government and our country...time will tell if it's not too late. If not for @realDonaldTrump we would be in very poor shape. Thank God for him and We The People that voted for him.

Wouldn't it be a good thing to make the dreamers legal? They would need to pay a hefty fine or a fee if you want to call it. That could be used towards border patrol or border security, just a thought. You could even say @realDonaldTrump came up with that.
@realDonaldTrump Stick to your guns Mr President. The American people and our military will NOT be held hostage to illegal immigrants! Dems own this. Btw, if you wanted to support the Vikings tonight. They have stood for flag and anthem all year. Go Vikes!
