@realDonaldTrump Wishing you a Happy 1st yr Anniversary of your Presidency. We are so grateful & thankful for all the sacrifices you have made to save America and @MAGA . You never let us down & kept all your promises. Thank you President Trump! God bless you & God bless America!
How ironic that not only did the US government shut down on the one year anniversary of the @realDonaldTrump presidency, but with a republican majority in the house.
Nice try, dumdum, but no one is buying it. YOU and @realDonaldTrump are responsible for this mess. What a maroon.... #MitchLIES

Absolutely true! Check out Judicial Watch's post about Obama-vintage program still run by operatives of DHS and HHS, who are seeding country with illegal aliens using commercial flights paid for by your tax dollars. Does Trump know? Doubtful, but he will now! @realDonaldTrump
I really believe @realDonaldTrump should instruct the DOJ to go after @davidbrockdc and @mmfa for money laundering. @Newsweek found out this week there is a new sheriff in town. #ReleaseTheMemo
@realDonaldTrump 365 days TOO long
@realDonaldTrump I don't care about the shutdown. I just looked through at least 100 photos, reliving last January 20th. Your inauguration was the day that America was saved. This is our anniversary, we love you, Mr. President. !!

@realDonaldTrump this chit needs to STOP pronto!! Who cares if there is no room in jail, don't let them stay, send them back!!
Why 19 days? Take vote in committee then send to @realDonaldTrump to give green light. 19 Congressional Days at the rate you people work means months. Get off your duffs and get it released NOW
@realDonaldTrump You were much better on the Apprentice.....why not try something else beside President...it just doesn't suit you!
@realDonaldTrump Putin asked if you picked up your laundry...
Somebody please let @SpeakerRyan and @GOP know that a few years ago @realDonaldTrump said that when there is a government shutdown is all on the president. #TrumpShutdown
To be fair - this is from an email @rebecccaballhaus received, I don't think she is pushing it as 100% accurate. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump should just be ashamed though.
At least someone is working hard besides me... @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
First it is announced that we are going tonstay in Syria for years to come and Afghanistan is blowing up, so much for @realDonaldTrump being a non interventionist.

@realDonaldTrump congrats on the first complete government shutdown when one party controls everything in U.S. history. A big achievement of just how pathetic the party in power is at governing.
@realDonaldTrump So they just made FISA worse and stronger! You have been a victim of FISA! Why would you allow them to do this? Did they bother to ask us? This is our country! Congress doesn't represent us! They just represent their pockets! Hypocrites!
@realDonaldTrump Please ban and take away ownership of media companies from those who are not natural-born US citizens.
So how is it fair that y'all will still be getting your paychecks but the people who fight for our country probably won't due to this government shutdown. @realDonaldTrump
Right...... So that 190,000$ from @realDonaldTrump to @StormyDaniels was for what then?
Imagine if President Shit-for-Brains spent his time trying to come up with a budget that could get 60 votes instead of his dumbass fake news awards show? @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump if Congress can't reach an agreement by the deadlines given to them, then why are they getting paid? Everyone else in the real world is reprimanded or fired when their job deadlines are not met.
Ooooooo CNN reporting Russian bots want the memo released, too! and Wikileaks! @realDonaldTrump what are you waiting for??
Please declassify the 4-Page memo. Release it to the public. Read it aloud at the SOTU. @realDonaldTrump #gop @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan WE MUST NOT LET THIS SEDITION STAND. DO IT FOR THOSE OF US WHO WANT TO MAGA.
