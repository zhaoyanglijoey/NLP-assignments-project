@realDonaldTrump the #RINO Congress a Senate under @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr are allied with globalists and their liberal counterparts. There goal will be to turn the House and Senate over to the liberals in November. @freedomcaucus
. @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke Why did the @USFWS quietly issue 16 permits to US entities for elephant parts/trophies months BEFORE you announced your flip-flop on the Elephant Trophy ban? #BeKindToElephants #BanTrophyHunting #BanIvory
A group of about 200 immigrants walking to the US border to seek asylum (something that has been done for about 8 years) and @realDonaldTrump is so scared he deploys the National Guard. Theatrical!
@realDonaldTrump attacks Amazon because CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post which hurts his feelings bigly #Trumphasfeelingstoo #COVFEFE #buthurtbigly
McMaster had to wait until he was leaving to attack Russia because he knew how @realDonaldTrump would've fired him for an attack on his base like this.

If you're looking to stop the spread of misinformation on Twitter, there's this Russian bot account that goes by the handle @realDonaldTrump that's long overdue for deletion...
@realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods replace State Dept. in Mexico who only care about trade with military persons who will focus on human trafficking. Caught drug lords are only replaced with new ones. We must go after the financial businesses who support money laundering.

Arrogant RINO China-$25-mil-kickback-recipient @SenateMajLdr undercuts @realDonaldTrump 's China tariff negotiations to KY businessmen siding with Dems again. @LouDobbs asserts @GOP opposition to @POTUS will cost the majority. He embarrasses Kentucky. #DitchMitch #ReplaceRyan
Is there a point where all of us who are mandated reporters will be brought up on charges by adult protective services for letting @realDonaldTrump continue to be a danger to himself and others? Seriously, people! #Impeach

I hope it turns out I'm wrong but I see @realDonaldTrump driving this relationship under someone else's direction and Putin being cautious and hesitant because he knows this. Trump just seems a little too much like someone doing what he's been instructed to do.
look HRC was a seriously flawed candidate and individual. But the fact u threw in all the other names tells me u have bought into the snake oil BS shell game of . @realDonaldTrump hook line and sinker. Open your eyes and ears and THINK!

No one who advocates the dissolution of a key portion of the US Constitution should hold any federal office. So glad that horrible, corrupt @HillaryClinton lost to @realDonaldTrump despite having everything in her favor. It takes a special type of idiot to lose in that manner.

It's springtime. Migrant labor picks crops in this country. Of course, we know @Realdonaldtrump has never eaten a vegetable in his life, so ending a #caravan coming to do work for American farmers won't hurt him. What say Idaho Republicans? #Crickets
In my personal opinion if you embrace @LouisFarrakhan you've given up your right to criticize @realDonaldTrump on just about anything.
There is NO EXCUSE FOR TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR, stop excusing the blatantly hideous acts, a madman in Office, #BigFatOrangeTweekyMan goes ballistic AGAIN!!!! @realDonaldTrump

Despite my constant rhetoric, I do feel pity for the likes of @realDonaldTrump , @Nigel_Farage and @DonaldJTrumpJr etc. Can you imagine the heartbreak and devastation they must feel looking in the mirror every morning, realising they haven't quantum leaped out of their bodies yet.
