Hey, Geraldo-- @realDonaldTrump hired those snitches, vipers, & rats (& has to fire many of them for being incompetent, racist, foreign agents, or wife beaters). Also, the rumor is Trump himself wants Ivanka & Jared out of the WH because of their questionable/unethical biz ties.
Maybe he has a peculiar delusion that @realDonaldTrump can peremptorily get him off the hook, or "pardon" him (for what?). I wonder if he's on the phone with Chee-to as we tweet screaming at him to fire Mueller. If Trump tries to defend Nunberg, a political OK Corral may ensue.

@realDonaldTrump I am letting the media know that I expect them to chase Melania until she speaks publicly about @realDonaldTrump affairs. You know, like they did with Hillary. It was wrong to do then, but not wrong to do now. I WILL expect the media to be even handed.
The real problem is that you're a fscking clueless idiot who is in denial because you can't face reality. @realDonaldTrump is a disastrously incompetent president NOW, and he'll get even worse when his senile dementia really kicks in.

@realDonaldTrump Donnie, Your gross ignorance, which pushes you to your own brand of stupidity, is keeping you from realizing that being "reined in" is all that keeps you from rushing over the cliff of your own design. 35 who have left your admin have gone over for you.
Was @MichaelCohen212 given a slush fund by @realDonaldTrump to pay off people who know the really salacious dirty dirt...like "PATERNITY Information?" How many payouts have been made? For what? When? And...Who is out there who can blackmail Trump? It's all going to come out.
This is unprecedented history folks. The media will not report on it. We are living through history for generations to read about for years to come. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst @POTUS Thank You!!

. @GOP @DNC Enough is enough! The gig is up! Stop the illegal Russian collusion investigation based on fake data from political opposition, fire Mueller and start investigating the real criminals. Obama, Hilary and the DNC. WE SUPPORT, @realDonaldTrump !!*!

That is so sad, unfortunately there is always a possibility! Hey @realDonaldTrump are you listening???
@realDonaldTrump As president you should stay out of this. There should be no what the constitution states. If 21 is going to be the age then they should noty be able to vote until age 21. @lois95387316
@realDonaldTrump tweeted his approva rating is around 50% according to Rasmussen. I guess 44% is around 50% but 54% disapproval rating, according to Rasmussen is also around 50%. Lying idiot.
I just love this picture of you, @realDonaldTrump . It really highlights your best features. pic.twitter.com/ZvYT48pIEs
@realDonaldTrump just pathetic? Stormy
I was asked to identify anything @realDonaldTrump does well. I thought hard & admitted he knows how to sell himself to the GOP & to his voters & his campaign was a 1st rate salesmanship tour! Then I realised that SALESMANSHIP TOUR anagrams into TRUMP IS AN ASSHOLE Gee!
@realDonaldTrump Stop talking about the friggin' summit with Fatlboy..... he is nothing without his ridiculous father.....you are being set up !!!!!! Take him down, send a look alike. He has nothing to lose......you do!
Walt Disney was a child rapist and his entire empire was built to groom children for pedophiles and have an organized child sex trafficking ring with help from CIA. All Disney movies are mind control and propaganda. TRUTH look it up! @realDonaldTrump #ThankQ #MAGA
whaat is the website ?? @realDonaldTrump plz see leadership of India France in enabling Solar and reducing green house gases - wish USA took this lead @nikkihaley
Imagine if @realDonaldTrump 's teachers were armed. @iamjohnoliver
I'm sure @ICEgov is doing just that. They have become @realDonaldTrump 's personal jack booted goon squad enforcing his and @jeffsessions racist agenda to make America white again. #Resist
Looks like @realDonaldTrump is scared of the NRA. White House vows to help arm teachers and backs off raising age for buying guns - The Washington Posthttps://apple.news/AdVbbe_8bQpmd9uatcUazhQ
@realDonaldTrump @NRA Do not fall for it. It's a violation of our gun rights to restrict the age to buy to 21. Our soldiers are 18,19,20 years old fighting for freedom with these guns. You cannot tell them they can't buy one because they are not old enough
@realDonaldTrump Pls step in &fix #corruption @DeptVetAffairs shooting in CA was preventable. #FailedVALeadership bury #Whistleblowing , #gaslight #Veterans , & put #corrupt folks in positions of power. #VAAccountability #Vets #veteranhiring #VeteransHome #WhiteHouse #veterans pic.twitter.com/3KBgoS5iWH
Mmmm how could you not support @realDonaldTrump ? He's my favourite lard shaped, sized, coloured human being. And i mean the used medical gauze he has for hair??? Slays me every time
DOJ and Twitter users blocked by Donald Trump argue First Amendment case in federal court - http:// go.shr.lc/2G91GCb - @washtimes no America can Constitutionally be forced to associate with people who hate them, even @realdonaldtrump . cry on your own page dummies!
Hey @realDonaldTrump , instead of blindly and offensively tweeting this evening, just watch @Oprah on @60Minutes & try to actually learn something about humanity!

Nothing is beneath the office of this presidency . The thing occupying it @realDonaldTrump keeps lowering the bar to the level of his own sick and desperate narcissism . Our democracy is being slowly driven over the cliff by a sociopath . At what point will the @GOP take action?
@realDonaldTrump thats alright . #WeThePeople know the #Truth #WRWY and LOVE YOU #GodBless45
@realDonaldTrump Careful with that Kim boy. I tussled with his grandpa a bit back in '50. Double-shot of my 80 proof, roll up them sleeves and let's get to work.
This is also a lie. This is @realDonaldTrump lying Sunday.
@DearAuntCrabby @chucktodd @realDonaldTrump ha..ha...NOT!
@realDonaldTrump said even worse during the 2016 #POTUS campaign, yet many people like you VOTED for him????

Just saw on Newsy that @realDonaldTrump is seeking out the attorney that represented Clinton in his impeachment proceedings. #fatNixon is starting to sweat. #impeachment of #@realDonaldTrump. Go #BlueWave2018 and beyond!!!
@realDonaldTrump says he's done more than any other president. He's right. He's done more to embarrass America than any other president.
#democRAT leaks on . @realDonaldTrump - #Russia dossier mislead media ... http:// go.shr.lc/2p7vTcz
It is absolutely hypocritical of #Dotard @realDonaldTrump to claim that he's the "least anti-Semitic person", even right in front of the press. Why does he go inciting anti-Semitism when his own daughter has already converted to Judaism? His "very fine people" are to blame too.
This just in: #Chickenshit @realDonaldTrump who was going to take guns 1st, ask questions later is in fact doing NOTHING. #TrumpIsAffraidOfTheNRA #TrumpSupportsMassShootings #TrumpForPrison
@seanhannity @rushlimbaugh George Soros just pumped in a million $$ to vote out the incumbent San Antonio DA Nico Lahood. We need a loud vocal @realDonaldTrump to support the SA GOP candidate @TyldenShaeffer

it should be obvious to everyone spending $30 million on a military parade instead of helping veterans in need is spot-on @realDonaldTrump brand. #MAGA
Give me the Obama family any day! The @realDonaldTrump family are nothing but crooks and liars. Melania dosen't love the man. She loves the money!
@realDonaldTrump hates anybody who doesn't have money, or can't raise money.
I did. I always do. I can't watch or listen to @realDonaldTrump Hopefully people will start blocking all stations, who give #Trump any air time! I turn on the news AFTER he's finished

Can someone please explain to me why the left is so convinced that @realDonaldTrump has done something illegal that warrents impeachment / prison. I seriously have no idea. Someone, preferably on the left please explain in detail with supporting facts. Thank you
@realDonaldTrump What is with your neurotic attachment with guns? Your obsession with all things military will be the demise of all things American. History will not look kindly on your presidency.
HELL NO! Emphatic NO! Definitely NOT! #nowall #dumbassery @assifiditty @realDonaldTrump #NotMyPresident #bluewallofdems #BlueWaveComing2018 pic.twitter.com/eN6NXSFYhb

Another broken promise as @realDonaldTrump repays the NRA for its 30M in blood money
If @realDonaldTrump wanted to really mess with @jeffsessions head, he would legalize #marijuana #CannabisCommunity
"Make America Sane Again!" After @realDonaldTrump is impeached
because @realDonaldTrump wants money from the NRA and he supports more dead kids.
@realDonaldTrump is afraid of the NRA
she's smart and NOT ashamed of who she is. Sadly, this will have no effect on the GOP's unwavering support. What does @realDonaldTrump have on @SpeakerRyan & @HouseGOP ?

@realDonaldTrump ...... President Trump IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL PRESIDENT in American History. THE DEMOCRATS, THE AMERICAN AND WORLD LIBERALS, THE FAKE MEDIA, THE ESTABLISHMENT, AND THE AMERICAN AND WORLD ELITES, will not be able to destroy him.
