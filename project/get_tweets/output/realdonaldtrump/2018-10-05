Now the Republicans will try to convince the Democratic majority in House (after the election) to impeach @realDonaldTrump . Of course, they'll do it behind the scenes so it can't be blamed directly on them.
. @lisamurkowski #Alaska does not have the intellect to make decisions that impact Americans. Just simply clueless. Dry her District up until we can find a person worthy of this high office. @RNC @senatemajldr @SenateGOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #Kavanaugh
@realDonaldTrump Thats it with Murkowski and the oil deal-she has got to go-
It feels good to see them finally find their balls. They owe it all to @realDonaldTrump

Sorry @realdonaldtrump . Can't use President to refer to you. You may have the nominal title, but you have yet to exhibit a single presidential or leadership quality. Stop being an idiot. We are not paid proffessionals. Not like the Craig's list recruits at your rallies. We Care.
And f*** every woman that LIES about rape. F*** every individual that uses the race card. F*** every LGBTQ individual that thinks we HAVE TO ACCEPT their lifestyle. And MOST OF ALL, F*** everyone of you that has put a burden on the 63MILLION ppl that voted for @realDonaldTrump !

@lisamurkowski @FoxNews @GOP @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @marklevinshow Dear Sen Murkowski, I have ZERO confidence in Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her blatant as well as her appearance of impropriety on important issuesTHIS citizen holds dear. She should be removed! @senatemajldr

Two perfect qualities as personified by the @potus @realDonaldTrump . He's perfectly qualified. #NoKavanaugh
Did you forget about Justice Ginsburg, @lisamurkowski ? Why did SHE get a pass when she showed the appearance of impropriety if it's so important to a Judge? How confident do you think the public felt when she talked trash about @realDonaldTrump ?
Good. Let the @GOP have @realDonaldTrump and go down with the ship! #BlueWave #Vote #EveryVoteMatters pic.twitter.com/P3LzDHdtJQ
No matter how much success the country has, as long as @realDonaldTrump is your president, you will never be happy. So therefore, I will never listen to you.
Now Sen. Lisa Murkowski is blaming the White House & @realDonaldTrump for what happened to Judge Kavanaugh. She is spinning it to look good. Your democratic friends laughed this attack for the only reason to make the President look bad and score political points
By attacking the motives of women who accuse men of sexual predation, @GOP and @realDonaldTrump give license to such attacks and a defense to the perpatrators. By their own actions they make sexual assault and violence against women acceptable behavior.
Start pulling federal contracts from Alaska @realDonaldTrump

#Murkowski @realDonaldTrump @lisamurkowski @FoxNews Murkowski's decision and statements are ludicrous. What she has cited as appropriate behaviour is related to a Justice that has already been seated - not a nominee fighting for his life's reputation. Just stupid.
@lisamurkowski is a #RINO . I Am listening to her Position on #Kavanaugh and she sounds like a freaking @DNC @realDonaldTrump hater obstructionist. Aargh!
@realDonaldTrump are You amused Sir? I know not to ask I need a reaction Son

Way to go @realDonaldTrump ! Thank you! President Trump!!! We the people are with you!
@lisamurkowski I have lost faith in you. Do you really think that if Brett had met your high bar most would not have said that he must have done it since he did not react strongly... stop your BS and get off the floor @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump PRESIDENT Trump I support you 100 percent. You have lived up to all your promises and I respect you for that. Semper fi
Then he should show it in his tweets. All he ever does is blow @realDonaldTrump . Is he hoping to secure employment in the administration?

Are you threatening a judge's life? Maybe this should be brought to @realDonaldTrump

The people at @realDonaldTrump rallies have it correct...CNN SUCKS!
@realDonaldTrump The entire process is corrupt since McConnell and the republican party decided they could do whatever. Stolen elections when the majority lose's, asking for help and getting it from Russia. The frosting on the cake is the idiot president.
So #SenatorCollins is okay with the fact that @realDonaldTrump wrote @BrettKavanaugh statement for the hearing. Yep, that impartiality

Maybe! It would be nice to actually see one celebrity leave, like they said they would when @realDonaldTrump was elected, to a far away land. You know what? I would actually have a little respect for them no matter what their politics if they kept their word. But, they are fakes.

The @GOP isn't a US problem - it's a global problem and a threat to the entire world and to world peace. @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace to the US and he is consolidating power by the second.
