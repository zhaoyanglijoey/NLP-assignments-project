@realDonaldTrump nice job remembering the Las Vegas massacre today too
Cowards don't fight, they get others to do it for them or they do it by insidious means. I could cough that cowardly @realDonaldTrump down and I am only 4'10.5" tall, weigh 7st and I am a 'girly'!!!! How embarrassing for him. One of these and he would be down
He's Lying!!! @PhilosophySeel Desperation like @realDonaldTrump ! It's called she's ignoring you because you don't matter!!!!
Bernie why should we care about America anymore if it is about to become a terrible place again with @realDonaldTrump selling us out to every short of the liquor lobby? What is going to be left that is good? We are never going to face the issue with people like this leading them
All the con man @realDonaldTrump did was change the acronym (Somebody tell him what that means) because he feels so inferior to our best president ever @POTUS44

My man @realDonaldTrump has the crowd going crazy in Johnson City! Love it! USA chants are great!
I am going to ask the Democrats to take a page out of the book of Russia, North Korea, Canada & Mexico & learn how to work with our President @realDonaldTrump so we can all conquer our multiple global challenges & take a step forward into a good future Together. #TeamEarth

@ABCWorldNews Just despicable to see the president disrespect @CeciliaVega at the press conference today. What a rude SOB @realDonaldTrump is. No class whatsoever. Pathetic.
Once again the Trumps celebrate the end of a drama cycle totally of their own making. So we have a slightly altered NAFTA that only includes provisions that would have been introduced with TPP and @realDonaldTrump celebrates it as a success. All he did was create chaos.

I think the appropriate thing for Kav to do would be to withdraw. A nice statement: "This is continuing to be too difficult for my family and too divisive for the country. I look forward to continuing to serve America as a Federal judge." @realDonaldTrump

In deep-red Tennessee, @realDonaldTrump tells his ardent supporters that Democrats will "flood your streets with criminal aliens," echoing the fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric that fueled his victory in 2016. But will it help the @GOP defend the House in November?
@realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley demand the FBI get a copy of Dr. Ford's high school yearbook and that they talk her boyfriend who said she stalked him and also look into her current billion dollar pharma employer
I stand with you @CeciliaVega . Stand up to that bullying slob @realDonaldTrump
So you think using taxpayer dollars to help one party over the other is a Constitutional use of taxpayer dollars? Because it's not. The government isn't allowed to play favorites, though @realDonaldTrump doesn't seem to understand that ... and a great many other things.
