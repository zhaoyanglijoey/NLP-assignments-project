How can @realDonaldTrump hold a meeting with Putin just after he has assassinated a UK citizen? Call off this meeting instantly!
@realDonaldTrump what is wrong with you? You are obviously a very damaged person.... One who we unfortunately we have to live with, for now. That video just reiterates how much outside help you received in the 2016 election.
@CorbieCrow @realDonaldTrump Trump is so weak and tired
@realDonaldTrump I am watching a documentary - Dirty Money - on the Volkswagen scandal. THANK GOD FOR THE EPA. Quit trying to destroy our air and water!
Your GRUDGE against Obama is childish. And at what cost to the American people, are you willing to ruin this country and all it stands for? @realDonaldTrump Health Insurers Warn of Market Turmoil as Trump Suspends Billions in Payments https:// nyti.ms/2lYVTpj
@realDonaldTrump LATINO FAMILIES AND GOSPEL BLACKS ARE YOUR SEED BEDS.
@realDonaldTrump can your heart please fail now? Your brain has clearly gone to mush yet you keep breathing.
. @realDonaldTrump NATO has a very real purpose - to contain Russia. If we don't work with NATO countries that nerve gas fiasco will land on U.S. shores. It may be here already with the Russian oligarchs,posing as businessmen, who have been given citizenship. NO. MORE. RUSSIANS
i hope the choice to know is yours does not imply that the russian narrative and or the msm narrative about everything will persist. #WWG1WGA #WeThePeople #GrowTheNetwork #DeepState #TheRainMakers #IBOR #Qanon #potus #MAGA #OneVoice #TrumpWorld @realDonaldTrump

@TheSimpsons predicted it with such stunning accuracy even the electoral map win What they didn't predicted is how great the #economy will be and the secret #Genius of @realDonaldTrump that will invest in #RenewableEnergy more so than @MikeBloomberg to beat him at his own game pic.twitter.com/EEWJ9TklAo
You not fight for Democracy, you fight for your agenda to get votes from illegal immigrants and to stay in the senate! The truth is what will take you down and bring justice to the real Democracy! @realDonaldTrump @thehill @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump Here's why you should pick Amy Coney Barrett for the SCOTUS: - You and the Trump base of voters want a committed constitutional originalist who will interpret the constitution based on original intent+ who can reliably remain conservative (like Clarence Thomas).
More like incredible disgust. The only positive thing that came from @realDonaldTrump is that his presidency has exposed all of you for who you really are. At least you used to pretend you cared.
@IvankaTrump how does feel to be rejected by #TomBrady in favor of an immigrant @giseleofficial ( way better human being than you'll ever B ' ) & her father unlike yours @realDonaldTrump , isn't called the #AdolphHitler of 21st century !! Trump brand will haunt u & Fredo (DonJr)

Just your daily reminder that every time traitor and #FakePresident @realDonaldTrump attacks journalists and calls them the enemy of the people, he commits #perjury , because he took an oath to uphold the Constitution, which guarantees a free press, and he's lying under that oath.
INDICT the Clinton's now @realDonaldTrump

Folks just don't get that raising minimum wage, giving free college tuition & maternity leave are necessary because of the #FED Bank's #DebtBasedMoney . They are only being offered to prevent people from rioting & demanding the end of the FED. @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TheDemocrats pic.twitter.com/oOzHieRkJs
Palm Beach reports @realDonaldTrump hires foreign workers by the dozens ... with hardly any effort to hire American. Viz, he not only refuses to hire American ... he lies to DOL about his efforts to do so +breaks their rules to pay prevailing wages.
Is that because he is trying to deport all of them? @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump #notmypresident
But ....They are mostly anti Trump @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Please put sanctions onto any companies and countries for the direct funding of an evil totalitarian terrorist regime. This is simply evil

Never. Gets. Old! Thank you @realDonaldTrump .
Speculation in the @ThePost @HillaryClinton might run again in 2020. If @realDonaldTrump looks strong going into campaign season, @TheDemocrats might nominate her rather than waste a rising star like @SenKamalaHarris . It would be both pathetic and hilarious simultaneously.
If @RealDonaldTrump can't have a Roe v Wade litmus test in selecting a #SCOTUS judge, why does Congress get to have one? They should not be allowed to ask if the candidate would overturn it.
The world really is laughing at us. I had some very nice #Canadians ask if I knew where they could buy a #MAGA hat so they could give it to a friend as a #joke . This is where we are now. @realDonaldTrump is a joke that really isn't funny anymore. #Resist

What to expect from #groper at the NATO meetings? He will come out with guns blasting against either @realDonaldTrump or Russia ... or both. He will be bombastic and emphatic about something there. This will further distract from who and what he is and
President @realDonaldTrump needs to shove Dodd-Frank up Barniece Fwanks fat a**. Sideways. I'd like to see them all get the firing squad, on national TV
That sounds appropriate to me! @realDonaldTrump is doing far more harm to America than OJ ever did. How is possible that Dershowitz could even begin to draw this comparison? He is supposed to be smarter than this!
Funny to watch the ridiculous fake #WalkAway accounts. Unfortunately there are a large number of ignorant @realDonaldTrump supporters that will believe them, and we have an ignorant and despicable president that will shamelessly promote them. #LoserTrump #pathetic #BlueWave2018
Please @DickDurbin have your Senators block @realDonaldTrump SCOTUS pick & then we can wipe out those Democrats & have a Republican majority.

@realDonaldTrump & Epstein were accused of beating & raping a 13 year old girl. She withdrew the charges. Did Trumps fixer @MichaelCohen212 contact her? Trump & his associates feel entitled to do as they please, sexual assault, rape, beatings are all for their entertainment.
@realDonaldTrump will be the next one poisoned by Putin...
You are indeed correct. However, you must remember that those people are NOT Christians; rather they are Trumpians, adherents of Trumpianity, reverentially faithful to their Messiah. @GOP @TheDemocrats @Im_TheAntiTrump #TheResistance @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse
After the tax break, Orrin Hatch giddingly said "this is going to be the best presidency ever". After the tariffs Orrin said "I want to kill 'im". Im not sure if he meant the tarrifs or Trump. Orrin won't answer the question. @realDonaldTrump

The more we learn about Liddle Twit @realDonaldTrump , his temperament, lack of intelligence, and his focus on "me," (his "I"s are too close together), the more frightening it is to think of him in one-on-one meetings with leaders such as Kim and Putin, who can and do play him. pic.twitter.com/PicZnycGo6
