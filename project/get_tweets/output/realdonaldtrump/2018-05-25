Pres @realDonaldTrump Please consider changing bullshit tax laws like owing taxes on things you win. Ppl who enter sweepstakes don't have money. It's why they enter them in the first place. Bartering. Trading items equates to equal value not income. Garage sales. Seriously wrong.
Hey @realDonaldTrump JUST STOP LYING YOU BIGOTED RACIST MORON #NeverMyPresident
@realDonaldTrump ZTE uses technology to track & spy on users & this has enabled China to STEAL hundreds of billions from US in developed technology. Trump did not shut ZTE down and all of a sudden "China is stealing our jobs!" changed to "We have to protect China jobs!"
Not with @realDonaldTrump at the helm!

Actually everyone ! I think that Kim Jong Un actually wants to make this happen. It means alot of $ and prosperity ! Sanctions hurt him. Unlike POS Hillary and Obama , @realDonaldTrump is not set on destroying North Korea . Thanks to Hillary and Obama , slave actions in Libya!

@realDonaldTrump quick to say people need to follow the law; but, of course he thinks he is to powerful to follow the law.
This #MemorialDayWeekend let's remember that U.S. soldiers died fighting wars around the world so that one day a reality TV star could be @POTUS . Also, let's remember @realDonaldTrump excuse for not fighting with them. #BoneSpurs .
@realDonaldTrump You have to care about the health, safety, livelihood and well being of the people of a country or you shouldn't call yourself President. #TrumpTheHypocrite #PresidontTrump #MuellerIsComingforyou #InprisionTrump and the whole #TrumpCrimeFamily #ItsMuellerTime
He must be stopped before he completely destroys this once, prior to 1/20/17, great nation that we love. Do your job Congress. Impeach Benedict Donald NOW! @realDonaldTrump

I'm saddened that those #Resisters hate @realDonaldTrump more than they love America. America...love it or leave it.
VERY DISTURBING INDEED!! @realDonaldTrump @Cabinet @SenateGOP @parscale I predict this will be the next crisis in America - coming soon to a TV network near you! @SoBaySD4Trump @southernkimmy @beangiterdone @DemiWuflower @MikeESteelr0077
@realDonaldTrump My name is Danny Lane, a decorated Vietnam Marine. I have suffered with PTSD for 50 years. My new book "Some Gave it All" is about the battles in war and the battles I still fight decades later. I want to bring national attention to veterans suicide. Help!
@realDonaldTrump You might find the jail we had in the 1950s in Cincinnati fascinating. It looked like the Biltmore but inside were cells with bucket and hay. Not a place anybody wanted to get themselves into again. We were taught the laws in grade school. Ignorance no excuse

I think you need to see this. It ties in with everything. That includes the corruption in the FBI. They let it in the door...& then lied.

Almost everyone on Twitter is refusing to acknowledge the name Seth Rich for fear of something huge. Perhaps that is why Julian Assange has been silenced. Seth Rich worked for the DNC. Seth Rich is now dead. @realDonaldTrump

DEMS are rejoicing over the US/NK Summit cancellation. These selfish, self-absorbed hateful people hope we'll believe that they want what's best for our country? When they only find pleasure from thinking (wrongly) that @realDonaldTrump has failed at something we really see them!
I hope he gets so angry and upset that he tells everyone what @realDonaldTrump or his flunkeys asked him to do with Wikileaks.
Well said, even though as usual it will fall to deaf ears of @realDonaldTrump & more importantly the #Republicans !
Funny to listen to @POTUS talk about deals. @realDonaldTrump has to be the worst deal-maker EVER! Unless you consider the fact that he is lining his pockets while delivering 0 for the U.S. without blinking an eye. #Oligarchs #TrumpIsCorrupt #NoWayToRunACountry
He is the demonic one chosen by Satin or is Satin in disguise. Boycott @netflix and support @realDonaldTrump . We must fight the Evil that is Obama.

Any time @realDonaldTrump signs an executive order you can completely tell he has no political agenda, other than stroking his base, and that he's a puppet for special interest groups on a level never before seen in US politics.
I want every single one those children accounted for! @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems #ICENazis
Trump may be cutting programs but, in my opinion, if @realDonaldTrump doesn't end the OBVIOUS waste that is the TSA. Nothing he's saying he is doing as POTUS is real. Sad. Losers. Failed programs... total waste of tax money.
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Torshin? Romanov? Outside connects to NRA? &, Jr.? The list of added foreign citizens grows. &, Jr. named along side many. Maybe headlines are prescient. Should Jr. be scared? What else does Cohen know? How many Russian names to come?
@realDonaldTrump @JennKernsUSA looks like a typical Trump camper. Low IQ conspiracy theorist quoting Trump and Giuliani like they are the oracle of truth. NOT

Sure. But when it comes to it, he'll roll over. @SenateMajLdr isn't going to stop sucking @realDonaldTrump 's dick at THIS point, he's gone way too far.
It truly is time for @realDonaldTrump to be impeached.
You need to read this, where were you in 2016? Oh ya, you only get wound up when it's @realDonaldTrump . Your outrage should be levied at congress, previous admins and both parties.
@realDonaldTrump Pressure on Saudis and Russia to increase oil production isn't good for America. They'll crash the market (as before) and our energy independence gets behind by years. Our country has got to be independent and continue exporting. Low prices, no drilling!
@realDonaldTrump hope u just listened to Jason on Dobbs.Sessions not even at meeting yesterday.Missing.Has given job to corrupt Rosenstein.Needs to go.Does nothing and Rosenstein never trusted.Keep embarrassing yourself with this crap Out of control.Base says everyday u will fire
@realDonaldTrump : animals that talk! Imagine that.
Amb. @RichardGrenell nailed it! #China agrees to #sanctions against #NOKO to make them behave, but then they never actually implement those sanctions. @realDonaldTrump applies just the right pressures & now China is doing it right. Why won't the #Leftists recognize this #Reality ?

Amateur rube @realDonaldTrump in addition to being a repetitive business failure is also a dismal failure as a liar. He keeps insanely engaging in repetitions on a theme. Offering up easily disproven lies and fantasies. All of which are designed to skirt personal responsibility.
Can you tuck in @SteveSchmidtSES for the new @realDonaldTrump @VP Mike Pence @GOP policy of sepersting children from parents, yellow bands of shame, reporting?
Retweeted Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ): ...but complain and obstruct. They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump McConnell says he backs Mueller probe after classified briefing. McConnell's vote of confidence in Mueller's investigation came after he attended a highly classified meeting with top law enforcement and intelligence officials on Thursday.

Hence @realDonaldTrump need for extensive prep/questions/evidence/restrictions before Mueller mtg. Who knew telling the truth was so hard.
@realDonaldTrump are aliens real or nah?
These are called "lies" not "misrepresentations"! @realDonaldTrump L. I. E. S.! He lies about everything. Large and small. Meaningful and meaningless. He's a liar. He has no relationship with truth. Stop deminishing the disgraceful nature of Trump by lessening his deceptions.
As you know, I carefully observe what Leaders of Canada and USA are doing on a day to day basis. This is undeniable: @realDonaldTrump actively personally working and leading on dozens of very important files. @POTUS workload and work ethic is 100 times @JustinTrudeau pic.twitter.com/etJzYEEmeH

No, @realDonaldTrump ... our ancestors didn't "tame" a continent. They invaded an already occupied continent, and committed a pogrom against those occupants. Tens of millions, perhaps many more, were killed. All the while claiming "God" was on their side.
