@realDonaldTrump We The People that voted for and fully support you are relying on you to return Law, Order, and Honor to our once great Country. Any meeting off our shores, especially that region, is an extreme security risk that we cannot take at this critical time of MAGA.
Too bad @POTUS was not in office when the Benghazi nightmare happened resulting in the death of our ambassador and three others. Surely it would have ended much differently with @realDonaldTrump and his team in charge. #3amTeamTrump
@realDonaldTrump Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reportedly drafted a resignation letter after Trump railed against her in front of other officials: https:// aol.it/2rxOJus via @AOL So crude. Administration still running smoothly? Going to speak to Kim? God help us!
@realDonaldTrump I have never been able to dance freely. I never felt comfortable raising my hands in church. I never thought I could go to a concert and whoop. But I jumped up and down and whooped during your rally! Thank you for making me feel normal. Bless you forever.

@realDonaldTrump needs to be reminded as well, as he cast the die for egregiously bad and insensitive behavior. She was only following in her maker's footsteps, hoping for a thrown crumb of acknowledgment. It did not work.
If this kind of bullish comment was made by a Dem or anyone @POTUS doesn't like and it was directed to him or anyone he favors he'd be calling for them to be fired. So @realDonaldTrump how will you respond?
