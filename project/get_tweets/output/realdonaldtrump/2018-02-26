To have that much going on in your life and you become this ignorant shell. So privileged and so vindictive. That's where entitlement and greed lead you. May you live long enough @realDonaldTrump to see it done much better.
Reminder: @IvankaTrump is as much a feminist as @realDonaldTrump is courageous. That is to say that they're both chock full of platitudes, hypocrisy, and bullshit.
And a draft dodging @realDonaldTrump to run in and save everyone without a weapon. He doesn't need one. So why do you? #nomoreguns #CadetBoneSpurs
@GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenatorTimScott @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @CaseyCagle I really hope Delta Air Lines moves its headquarters out of Atlanta and leaves the NRA and all the rest of you Blood Money sucking leeches twisting in the wind.
@realDonaldTrump Why is no one talking about assigning the National Guard to guard our schools? It seems that should fall in their job description.
@IvankaTrump is a daughter in the @WhiteHouse nothing more. She has no experience doing anything she claims to be an advocate for, & outside of tweeting, has done nothing to add value. She is there to protect herself & Jared, and the Trump organization from @realDonaldTrump
#IvankaTrump the question you were asked on MSM is so insulting to you and your family. That's why I don't watch #MSM . I stand behind you and your family. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @VP did u notice no one can tweet to that little jerk Cameron kasky. I'll bet he got some heat for his flippant twirling of mic and childish diatribe to senator Rubio. That kid needed to be taught some respect. He's the class clown. Shame on parents
@realDonaldTrump funny how green cards are ok as long as they support your bank account. @maddow @CNN @Lawrence do you guys remember hearing anything about this?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Keep putting it in their faces, if they shrug it off, then the blood is on their hands. Democrats say but don't care. Just want to continue their agendas! SAD!
You can't believe anything @realDonaldTrump says
http:// aflcio.shpg.org/389550781t pic.twitter.com/bwc2U2D0ls @realDonaldTrump ATTACKING UNIONS NOW! ANYTHING GOOD 4 AMERICA IS NOT GOOD 4 GREEDY CRIMINAL TRUMP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP ! SEND THESE CRIMINAL PACKING IN NOVEMBER OR WE R SCREWED!
But, some of that $30 million came from Russia, didn't it? @realDonaldTrump doesn't want to make his buddy Vlad angry. He certainly doesn't want to make any of the @NRA guys with guns mad either. Since they're all overcompensating for their own shortcomings, they get mad easily.
NO, not everyone 1. Feels @realDonaldTrump did anything wrong. In fact, HE is the victim 2. Thinks its OK to be disrespectful to another, especially an elder, just because you're angry or upset 3. Thinks the NRA is an evil entity. In fact, the NRA are simply American citizens
@realDonaldTrump looks like the Dems knew something you didnt about DACA. #SupremeCourt
So @IvankaTrump you say that You shouldn't be asked whether or not if you believe the man that you have been sleeping with all your life (your Father) @realDonaldTrump if you think ALL the Woman that accuse him of sexual conduct are LIERS and YOU BITCH say YES they are !! UDOUCHE
