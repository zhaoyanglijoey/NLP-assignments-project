This is why @realDonaldTrump bashes the media When Hugh Hefner, a man that normalized sexual abuse is honored by @nytimes , but a man that dedicated his life to serving other is shamed...I have no words. LDS or not, Monson was an example of how to be a decent human being.

My final comment. Anyone who doesn't think that We the People was the reason @realDonaldTrump is @Potus does not care about America. It wasn't #SteveBannon It wasn't #Russia It wasn't @WikiLeaks It was regular people who love their country and wanted to #MAGA

Love the #MAGA Trumpers. "I didn't pay attention to or even know who Steve Bannon was before the election. I voted for Trump." They dismiss Bannon now by admitting they were uninformed before voting! Great statement about Trump's America. #Liar #DumpTrump #Sad @realDonaldTrump
I cannot believe I just ordered a book about @realDonaldTrump but... @MichaelWolffNYC you made me do it. #FireAndFury Every time a copy of this book sells, it drives #Trump crazy!! LOL
