Reminder: @IvankaTrump is as much a feminist as @realDonaldTrump is courageous. That is to say that they're both chock full of platitudes, hypocrisy, and bullshit.
And a draft dodging @realDonaldTrump to run in and save everyone without a weapon. He doesn't need one. So why do you? #nomoreguns #CadetBoneSpurs
@GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenatorTimScott @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @CaseyCagle I really hope Delta Air Lines moves its headquarters out of Atlanta and leaves the NRA and all the rest of you Blood Money sucking leeches twisting in the wind.
@realDonaldTrump Why is no one talking about assigning the National Guard to guard our schools? It seems that should fall in their job description.
@IvankaTrump is a daughter in the @WhiteHouse nothing more. She has no experience doing anything she claims to be an advocate for, & outside of tweeting, has done nothing to add value. She is there to protect herself & Jared, and the Trump organization from @realDonaldTrump
#IvankaTrump the question you were asked on MSM is so insulting to you and your family. That's why I don't watch #MSM . I stand behind you and your family. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @VP did u notice no one can tweet to that little jerk Cameron kasky. I'll bet he got some heat for his flippant twirling of mic and childish diatribe to senator Rubio. That kid needed to be taught some respect. He's the class clown. Shame on parents
@realDonaldTrump funny how green cards are ok as long as they support your bank account. @maddow @CNN @Lawrence do you guys remember hearing anything about this?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Keep putting it in their faces, if they shrug it off, then the blood is on their hands. Democrats say but don't care. Just want to continue their agendas! SAD!
You can't believe anything @realDonaldTrump says

But, some of that $30 million came from Russia, didn't it? @realDonaldTrump doesn't want to make his buddy Vlad angry. He certainly doesn't want to make any of the @NRA guys with guns mad either. Since they're all overcompensating for their own shortcomings, they get mad easily.
NO, not everyone 1. Feels @realDonaldTrump did anything wrong. In fact, HE is the victim 2. Thinks its OK to be disrespectful to another, especially an elder, just because you're angry or upset 3. Thinks the NRA is an evil entity. In fact, the NRA are simply American citizens
@realDonaldTrump looks like the Dems knew something you didnt about DACA. #SupremeCourt

. @realDonaldTrump Do you really believe that constantly tweeting "I am innocent" and "Look at Hillary" is going to change the outcome of the Mueller inquiry?
How is this not considered an act of war by Russia against America and yet our leaders do nothing about it. Amazing and incredibly sad. @realDonaldTrump - what about those sanctions???
@realDonaldTrump Please endorse @JeanneIves for IL Governor. Rauner is #NeverTrump , made our state a sanctuary for illegals and is making taxpayers pay 4 abortions. Ives is a real conservative, the most pro-Trump candidate and would be a great Trump ally in IL. #ILRevolution

@wolfblitzer @BobSMueller What if @realDonaldTrump was in such financial trouble somewhere that he did what @jaredkushner did to get loans so as to avoid bankruptcy? Could it be that Kushner did so because that is what his father in law said would work?
Odds of Kushner not being given access to anything @realDonaldTrump wants him to see are about as good as <blank>. Nope, they're not good unless the push continues for him to be removed completely from a WH position. And he needs to take his wife with him.
sure am tired of waiting for @realDonaldTrump to be arrested. #AmericaHatesTreason #Mueller #MuellerTime #MuellerIsComing #TrumpColluded #TRAITOR #TrumpCrimeFamily
@realDonaldTrump I hope that is fake news. Death penalty for drug dealers? You would be killing a lot of white suburban people. Iran/contra bleeds into the CIA.
The Vegas shooter and Parkland shooter were both @realDonaldTrump supporters. The Planned Parenthood shooter was a Christian Conservative. The kid who shot 9 people in a black church was part of an online community on Storm Front. @tedcruz took money from the guy who runs it.
Today would be a great day for @realDonaldTrump to decide he really is an American and not a russian operative, afterall. Hardly likely, but sure would be nice.
@realDonaldTrump thrives on "drama" as long as he's the star of it. He can't bear not being the center of attention. Weakest Most Insecure President Ever.

@realDonaldTrump It is difficult not to criticize everything you stand for, you are not intelligent enough to be aware of the image you are projecting to the world.
@realDonaldTrump MAWA. Trump is Making America Weak Again. But I give him credit for MRGA. Trump is Making Russia Great Again. This way, when Trump leaves office, he will be able to sign deal for Trump Tower Moscow.

@realDonaldTrump have you seen the death threat towards jared Mr President from the slug @johnpodesta
@realDonaldTrump You are either a coward or have been paid off, based on being afraid of agressively confronting Putin over Russian cyber attacks and your reluctance to challenge the NRA and protect our children and the general public. You are not smart, nor a leader. Resign!!!
@realDonaldTrump THANK YOU so much @POTUS for running in 2020. We the people need you. Hopefully you will start to drain the swamp. Bring in the military to get it started. @HillaryClinton needs to pay for her crooked doings.
This is exactly why the @POTUS should not make statements on issues and events where the facts aren't fully known. @realDonaldTrump just makes a fool of himself, and by association, all Americans. It is baffling that his ego is so frail he thinks he needs to interject on so much.
My prayer for @realDonaldTrump was for the weight of the job to press him to his knees. The Christians of this Nation overwhelmingly chose Trump over HRC. Confusing? It isn't to us. Weird? Heck yeah! But, God is confusing to those who are not inspired by His Spirit. I trust Him.
Does @realdonaldtrump know ANYONE who is NOT an active criminal?
@realDonaldTrump ok Mr trump you tweeter account is saying you or the real Donald Trump,so listen up Jerry brown of California is releasing criminal back in the city then we have gangs coming into the country, along with terrorist and all democrat can think about is our guns
Trump cant put those sanctions on russia cause as soon as he does theyre gonna snitch on his cullosion with them. Right, @realDonaldTrump ?

Do you think that will stop @realDonaldTrump from submitting top secret intel to his kids or someone who has his ear 24/7? No, it will not. The CIA and the FBI must be mindful of who they're dealing with, and be careful about what information they submit to 45. He's a liability.

@FLGovScott @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump 1)Why is this issue of gun control so difficult? Saving the life of a child is a no-brainer. If one life is spared as a result of banning assault weapons it is worth everything. Do you not comprehend how your words and actions are viewed?
If @realDonaldTrump is trying to inspire his base to get out and vote in the midterms, does he really think supporting Gun control is going to do it? We would be looking to vote for those who oppose him on that issue!
@realDonaldTrump You're losing me with this #GunControl thing.

It is so sweet after enduring the whole "Obama will take your guns" for 8 years, that it is @realDonaldTrump that calls for gun confiscation w/o due process. For the Trump voters not up to speed on any amendment but the 2nd, he's going to take your guns for no legal reason. @NRA
Wow, #GunControl is so obvious, even @realDonaldTrump gets it.
Tried to watch the press conference about gun issues & @realDonaldTrump said stronger gun laws would not make him popular but he has never cared about being popular. WHAT! Oh come on, you are BIGLEY in to being popular, biggest crowd, higest rating, you live for it...LOL

Our President gave the Dems the deal of their dreams in the school safety meeting yesterday. Just like with DACA, the Dems will never give @realDonaldTrump a win. The Dems count on issues like immigration and gun control to run on with no intention of solving the issues. #4Dchess
how about you leave AG Sessions alone so he can do his job without bias? How about the @realDonaldTrump focus on his job and not everyone else's...How does that sound? AGSessions is more honorable than Trump.. e_e
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump a friendly suggestion Mr President people who want to own a gun must atten weapon safety and use course. only after permitt to buy a gun is issuesed by local authorities one can purchase a gun just like owning a motor vehicles.

Just one more thing people have been babbling about since the release of "Grand Theft Auto" and now @realDonaldTrump is actually going to do it. What harm could this actually do?

@realDonaldTrump We cannot give up 2A rights because some teenagers well organized by the left say we must. I do understand their grief but I don't want to lose a family member either because I can't protect them from a criminal. And to be honest that's where this is headed.
Hey @realDonaldTrump are you still taking credit for the stock market. Asking for a country

The last trade war spurred on the Great Depression. @realDonaldTrump hates free markets and free trade. His inspiration is Mussolini, not Reagan or Goldwater.
@realDonaldTrump I fully support you, however if you implement this gun ban you WILL lose any campaign for re-election. It's a people issue not a gun issue. Stay the course sir, your country needs you now more than ever.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS NOT here. Not in our elections. Illegal aliens - non US citizens - have zero right to vote here! YOU must stop this!
In other words, @realDonaldTrump ignores all the evidence and makes a decision that will make him look good to the base but is actually bad for America.
I agree @realDonaldTrump , @jeffsessions is Disgraceful.
It is beyond time for @realDonaldTrump to release his taxes returns & it is now time for @FLOTUS to let us know exactly what her "extraordinary ability" is that got her an 'Einstein Visa'...Wait... I don't think I want to know the answer to that last one...

Angry and unglued is an everyday experience at @WhiteHouse with crime boss @realDonaldTrump and cronies
@realDonaldTrump I told you so. Flush w/ cash from the tax cut companies are heading for a "stock buyback binge of historic proportions."C-suites view the cut not as a green light to invest and build for the long haul, but as manna fr heaven to pump their faltering share prices
did you know @realDonaldTrump @POTUS and others worldwide who want to cut government spending actually want to shut down crucial infrastructure humans might use to survive government and corporate attacks, slow killing Americans with targeting & gutted legal and welfare system
@realDonaldTrump #sphincter
The journalists who have come to know to much have been killed + gone missing. We are talking about global crime and money laundering in the billions and billions. @realDonaldTrump thought he could just get in on it. But the evidence will come out and hopefully we learn the truth

@realDonaldTrump Homeland Security began after 911 so every agency could relate to each other. We need another type of Homeland Security. These agencies need a data base...social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, police, court orders, criminal records..

@realDonaldTrump , someone who is in as desperate financial trouble as @jaredkushner should not be in a position of power. It is too dangerous. He is desperate to refinance 666 Fifth Avenue, which has a $1.2 billion balloon payment coming due early next year.
@realDonaldTrump Lock Trump up!
My family has an extra $300.00 a month thanks to @realDonaldTrump What have you done to help the middle-class out?
@realDonaldTrump Trumpo go ahead mess with those countries that bring us clothes shoes food see what http:// happens.You guessed it will be running around naked
Hey hey! Look at you all! Connecting to impacts on real humans rather than handicapping the horserace. The crimes @realDonaldTrump and @GovGreitensMO are committing are more than personal problems-their inability to govern impacts on people who they are supposed to serve.

Every damn thing about @realDonaldTrump and this illegal administration IS a conflict of interest. This bs would not have continued 10 or even 15 yrs ago-they'd all be gone by now.
@realDonaldTrump I am a gun owner and support the second amendment, but please do not cave to the NRA a 18 cannot but alcohol in the USA then why can they buy a gun. I get the fact the can join the military at 18 and use all kinds of weapons, but that is with training.
@realDonaldTrump is pushing the dems to the far left & they're happily clustering there. The rest of America is slowly awakening to the brainwashing they'd been fed by the #fakenews folks and the socialists/progressives preening and virtue-signaling. They're busted now tho. #MAGA
. @realDonaldTrump thinks people are forced to watch SNL. By whom?
No, Mr. President, being angry at your team and lack of accomplishments is not a valid reason for starting a #tradewar . @realDonaldTrump is clearly not fit to serve as President. http:// nbcnews.to/2oL1Mrm

@realDonaldTrump is a master at what he is doing. I have no doubt he will be remembered in history books as one of the most effective Presidents we have ever elected. He is indeed draining the swamp without showing his hand. #TheArtOfTheDeal #MAGA #AmericaFirst #DrainTheSwamp

I've never read a statement so stupid and devoid of fact before. I'm sure even @realDonaldTrump would have tweeted something that would have had at least some tenuous string of truth to it. The day Ireland has a problem with "African Gangs" is the day I run outside naked #Lidl

@realDonaldTrump before trump starts a war with n.korea take a look at the stocks his friends are buying!
Fox News seems to be able to handle the chaos just fine. Sent the tarrifs message out in the AM, @realDonaldTrump blurts out the plan before days end.
A #leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way! @realDonaldTrump
Here's what it's all about: @realDonaldTrump is broke and in billions of dollars of debt to the Russians. EVERYTHING he does is in service of keeping his dirty little secret hidden because it proves he and his "brand" are a complete and utter fraud.

@realDonaldTrump -the irony of his Vetoes of @BarackObama era executive orders, is he wants to supplant them with his own signature in order to get praise from his base. So Sad
@realDonaldTrump You will NEVER become dictator of the American Republic. Moreover, you will be lucky to survive the next 6 months outside of prison bars for treason. The founders of our constitution knew of pretenders & potential despots like you. Enjoy the air you breath, now.

To me it's time for us to make sure there's a huge #Conservative margin in the #USCongress and pass everything and anything we want that will help those who said they'd leave America if @realDonaldTrump got elected actually leave, they belong in North Korea.

@realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, Humble Advice 41?: The situation in South Africa brought about by U.S. Intervention is headed toward a "white genocide." I suggest sanctions are in order before the comrades of the African National Congress complete ethnic cleansing.
