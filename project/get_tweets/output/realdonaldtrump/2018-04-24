Are you standing with the people in Tennessee who are victims of the hate crime by the man who currently has a bond when we have black men in jail awaiting trial with no bond for non-violent drug offenses? Can you tweet about that Mr. President? @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump incorporate police stations (not jails, no holding cells) into schools. One building saves money and shootings are solved

@realDonaldTrump Pres Trump-I heard something about Mike Pompeo. We want Pompeo in your administration. He is extremely valuable & intelligent. Do not allow the democrat thugs to get rid of him. We are disgusted because the Repubs outnumber the Dems, yet dems get what they want
@realDonaldTrump FYI: As POTUS, you are supposed to represent & include ALL citizens of USA, not just Republicans who support you. Therefore, you should be following protocol & including ALL parties in state affairs, like the State Dinner. Very low class.

Fixing the @IranDeal will disempower @realDonaldTrump to implement any of the proposed actions in the quoted Thread. Nixing the deal will be followed by more stringent measures. I.R will economically collapse and people of Iran movement will become more energised and focused.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for defending the doctor, it's not right to destroy people!
@realDonaldTrump trade with Europe, yes! no tariffs either way! hi TARRIFFS with cheap(ABUSED) labor countries because we have lost jobs to the very poor.Keep things simple! equal playing field & valuesl. Concentrate on the CARIB & CUBA trade & tourism, its clean& close to home.
@realdonaldtrump is #Putinspuppet unable to enact #RussianSanctions or reveal #trumptaxreturns as they reveal #trumprussia and his #Kompromat
@realDonaldTrump Most US citizens that pay attention to what you say have serious questions about your understanding of what the "truth" means. There is no stupid question, the only stupid question is one not asked. You cannot pardon your way out of Obstruction of @TheJusticeDept
RonnyJackson must have been drinking when he did @realDonaldTrump 's medical exam
I hope there are no trials or convictions until trump leaves office so he can't pardon them - @realDonaldTrump has no shame or moral values and will pardon even the most heinous traitor and criminal

That is possible, though there's also a good chance Macron understands how to best manipulate and influence him. @realDonaldTrump is neither intellectually nor strategically in the same league as many foreign leaders. And, he's especially no match for Putin. What do you think?
