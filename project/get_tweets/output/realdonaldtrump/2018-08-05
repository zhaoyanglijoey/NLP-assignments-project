@realDonaldTrump and #Q Can I get some kind of confirmation that you guys got the evidence? About what is actually going on with a certain program doing illegal research and illegal experimentation that is gov funded (our tax dollars) #Waiting
@realDonaldTrump
Ezekiel 28 talks about this same issue and I'm pretty sure the corrupt time is up! It takes strong leadership (which we have @realDonaldTrump ) and strong support of the leader which we also have #RedPill #VoteRepublicanNovember6
Most folks here in Austin are in complete denial that they are slaves to a corrupt system that @realDonaldTrump is working tirelessly to take down. WAKE UP. You aren't anyone I've ever heard of locally, so you thinking you need to speak on our whole city's behalf is comical.
@OverboardMovie @realDonaldTrump GARBAGE, I see they are pushing the mexican agenda now. Ruined a classic.

No, because @realDonaldTrump has never done any actual work to earn a vacation. He vacations every other week without doing anything
@realDonaldTrump 60 Minutes...OMG... Why has Trump Not Eliminated Assad <---- OPCW found NO chemicals NONE that's why.
So sad how many people don't know what's good for them. Love you @realdonaldtrump
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I was wondering if the DNC also paid the Russian lawyer to meet with Don Jr ? She did meet with Fusion GPS before and after meeting, didn't she?
Because @realDonaldTrump tweeted, I just saved $1 for Women of Action LA

@realDonaldTrump Checklist for Monday AM: 1) Declassify all documents related to the dossier and FISA warrant; 2) Summon Sessions and Rosenstein to WH and fire them; 3) appoint 2nd special counsel. Then go play golf
@realDonaldTrump build a school for black kids like LeBron and send every one who graduates to school like LeBron until u do that shut up n put yo toupee back on the nightstand sir.
Sorry but we are in charge. @realDonaldTrump #kag
Does that mean Amazon has pulled all the items that are pro @realDonaldTrump ?
Um, @realDonaldTrump disagrees and he said so via Twitter this morning.
I don't know why said "clowns" on the left need to down play anything, at least until @realDonaldTrump replaces the AG and the Director of the FBI. Just my thoughts on the matter.
Send Chicago the help they need @realDonaldTrump "Chicago is NOT a Trump Free Zone" they're begging for help
Soooo. I hear the big meanies at a @realDonaldTrump rally were taking selfies with #JimAcosta and he was happy to smile for the pictures. On the flip side, #JakeTapper advised @DLoesch that he hoped she had security and needed to leave the #CNN town hall immediately ...
@realDonaldTrump you're an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump you admitted your son purjured himself... In a public tweet... You are the reason your kid is going to go to jail... Keep tweeting!
If negative media meltdowns make @realDonaldTrump more popular --- will they start a positive blitz of good news to try to drive his numbers down ? Nah - they cannot even mentally comprehend it.

I've said it before and I'll say it again; Trump supporters are cult-like. No one can tell me that a rational person can continue to support @realDonaldTrump given all of the vile, disgusting and treasonous things he's done. It's mind-boggling and a shame.
. @realDonaldTrump would not care if @jaredkushner went to prison, might actually throw a party sending him off.

So far Putin has benefited handsomely from the weakness of beholden @realDonaldTrump . Of COURSE he's going to interfere again because Trump will do as much as he can get away with for him & the @GOP is too afraid to act.
@KingJames puts kids in school while @realDonaldTrump puts kids in cages
@realDonaldTrump You're very fucked
Thank you, Roni, for "FOLLOWING". Let's help #MAGA & #KAG for our Children, Grandchildren, Widows, Orphans & Anyone Who Needs a Hand-Up, NOT a Hand-Out. Our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Needs EVERY #DeplorablePatriot to #VoteRed2018 & #Promote #VoteRed at #Work & #Everywhere .

@realDonaldTrump see that tire on my page. YOU MADE THAT! remember the kids that you wanted hanged in public?
Weird. Same thing happens to @realDonaldTrump . Didn't used to be like that before weak Jack became a puppet of the communist NWO.
@realDonaldTrump His mommy never told him no. Pathetic. Trump loves to replay his rallies to relish his brilliance https:// dailym.ai/2MlHmiY via @MailOnline
Hey @realDonaldTrump , are sea levels rising because there are too many ships on the sea? Or too many sharks swimming ?
The WH trotted @FLOTUS out to try to take the heat off of @realDonaldTrump . They think everyone is as stupid as members of Cult 45.
@realDonaldTrump A veterans wife!! TELL us again how much you care about the Vets! Now THAT is fake news.
. @realDonaldTrump this is OUR @POTUS stops the car to say Hello to #FireFighters this is a @SecretService nightmare but he is #WeThePeople President @DylanShaw @GavinShaw20 he Loves American @VP @WhiteHouse @parscale @Scavino45
Sad. @realDonaldTrump is a fucking douche bag. Not surprising but extremely sad nevertheless.
@realDonaldTrump you can hold rallies where you give out bile. I know the caliber of the people at those rallies. They want a country that GIVES them a gold goose. They are the ones who disregarded the warning signs of problems within the companies they worked for.
@RealDonaldTrump Stop whining!!
While, @KingJames is entitled to his opinion and I respect that he is unafraid to express. It was Lebron who attacked @realDonaldTrump first. Our President was defending himself. Lets call a spade a spade.

@realDonaldTrump can you call summer fake news ? I'm tired of being hot.
I didn't call you dumb, I questioned if you had read the previous tweet. That response was aspousing anti-American sentiment, I was pointing out to him and you that I am in Canada and he should direct those comments to the leader of that country, @realDonaldTrump . Simple.
