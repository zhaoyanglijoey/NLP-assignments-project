Yeah who does that? I mean knowingly stating false or misleading information in a public forum should be left to the pros, like politicians or reality TV stars. Right @realDonaldTrump ? Speaking of aren't u due for another outlandish decree?

@realDonaldTrump your wife and kid were not worthy of using the umbrella? Why so selfish loser?
@realDonaldTrump does not like hearing the truth about himself. @realDonaldTrump does not take any responsibility for his words or actions. @realDonaldTrump is never wrong and never admits to being wrong. Only others are wrong, never @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump I'm waiting for the fake media awards. If o stand corrected it was held off until today. Your letting me down... which isn't uncommon these days.. But hell it may be just about the only thing you've done I've looked forward too. What a let down
It's a "stormy" time for declaring success with this attempt at presidency, @realDonaldTrump .
Which ever reporter asked the military Doctor if Trump had false teeth deserves the FAKENEWS AWARD. What kind of inappropriate, stupid question was that? @realDonaldTrump @RealAlexJones
Thank God for @realDonaldTrump

Are the fake news awards still happening @realDonaldTrump ?

What Stormy Daniels confirms is that @realDonaldTrump uses prostitutes, which makes the salacious allegations in the Michael Steele dossier more believable @CNN
Serious question: Was this part of @realDonaldTrump 's much-ballyhooed Fake News Awards that he promised for Wednesday afternoon? Trump praises Bob Dole at Capitol Hill award ceremony @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2Dj2k1t
And THIS is why @realDonaldTrump should never have run for office - all his dirty little secrets are coming out for us to laugh at... he should've kept his scam secret.
@realDonaldTrump You're NOT helping. By all means, tho, do continue.
Classy @realDonaldTrump honors the great Bob Dole.
@realDonaldTrump Mister President I am anxiously awaiting the results of the fake news awards, who are the big losers?
@realDonaldTrump - please listen to The Trio sing the national anthem - would be great singing at the super bowl

@realDonaldTrump Thank you President Obama for helping get the country on track economically. Too bad your successor, Trump, is taking all the credit --like the arrogant fool he is. Sigh.
@realDonaldTrump sir, you must keep your word and go forward with the presentation of the fake news awards. Your integrity is at stake.
#CBTS_stream#GreatAwakening #Antischool_ftw Red pill the normies. #WeThePeople @realDonaldTrump
When asked once on TV what @realDonaldTrump and his daughter Ivanka had in common, he answered (to her bemused chagrin), "Sex." IMHO, she didn't seem as shocked by that answer for it being wrong and completely out of nowhere, as is she did for it possibly being secretly true. ijs

@realDonaldTrump they're buttering the pan.
We have enough on @realDonaldTrump to call him a sick incestuous racist nazi. Wonder if History will be kinder to him and make him a more complex character.
I always love when @FoxNews actually reports data that proves @realDonaldTrump is a fraud. #FactsMatter
