@realDonaldTrump you killed those children @Parkland, Fl. When u turned over Obama's mandate that would have prevented Cruz from buying a gun & shooting them. I think you are a terrible President bc you don't listen!
@realDonaldTrump Innocent kids like myself, kids with hopes and dreams and bright futures, died yesterday at the hands of a man who should not have had AN ASSAULT RIFLE in the first place. Want to make a difference and help the American people? Enforce gun control.
Direct line from @realDonaldTrump to shooter-the hat gives it away-eh donny boy. He is one of YOURS! OWN IT!! #resist
Why isn't anyone questioning Preibus? Did he purposely withhold information from @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump fuck you
I have an idea @realDonaldTrump : How about @GOP passes a bill that picks the number of children who must DIE in their schools before you'll f-ing DO SOMETHING to stop the gun #epidemic in this country? How about it? How many? HOW MANY?? We hit that number, YOU act. Whaddya think?
@realDonaldTrump I am tweeting this as a concerned American. I am a 20 year old college student who would like to offer insight concerning the recent school shooting and mass shooting in general. Why not hire veterans and retired police officers and arm them to guard the schools?

And if you voted for @realDonaldTrump FUCK YOU TOO
@realDonaldTrump You have often pointed to mental illness as the underlying cause for mass shootings, but one of your earliest actions as president was to undo a regulation that would make it more difficult for people with a known mental illness to buy guns. BRAVO to you.
@realDonaldTrump You gutless turd, get out of the NRA'S pockets and start working on real gun control

Instead of discussing mental health management strategies after the 8th school shooting in the first 7 weeks of 2018 you need to be altering your defective gun laws so that people with mental health conditions can not access a weapon and murder people @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump if there is ONE thing you do right. Address school shootings. We should not be afraid to send our children to school.
We don't even know. There is no indication that he was being treated for anything. This is a b.s. deflect that @realDonaldTrump lives for using! It's also common given for a white suspect. His family knew of the gun yet, saw no problem with it. Who does that if he's mentally ill?
