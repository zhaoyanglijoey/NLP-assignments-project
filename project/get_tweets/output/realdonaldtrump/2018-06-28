@realDonaldTrump Impeach Trump
@realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions Fire Rosenstein
are democrats going to make a clean break from the clinton dynasty? Is she clinging to party control with money, wanting to run again? Are younger members too scared to challenge her? @SenSanders @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
@ErinBurnett on CNN has already blamed @realDonaldTrump
hey u gonna take this? @realDonaldTrump
President 'Big Brother' would not agree with you. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #Corrupt #Resistance #SteamingPileOfTrump #PresidentBoneSpurs #FatNixon #StableGenius #FakePresident #PutinPuppet #ImpeachTrump

You are complicit by not speaking out against the rhetoric from your dictator @realDonaldTrump
Bosio just admitted in his denial piece that he openly fat shamed our head athletic trainer by calling him fat. Nice guy . I notice he used the locker room talk excuse like the Fuhrer @realDonaldTrump . Makes me wonder why the Cubs suspended him for two weeks.
So @realdonaldtrump are you offering to get these fools out of jail for attempting to kill journalists? Because you have in the past when people spoke out at your rallies. Say how's that old freak's trial coming? Is he your campaign manager now?

@realDonaldTrump What Democrats are those exactly?
so it did take long for @cnn to get back to @realDonaldTrump & Russia any wonder why their ratings are so terrible
@realDonaldTrump I am inspired by how unapologetically, consistently principled he is. No matter what. Doesn't matter what the trends in DC or Europe are. Carry that to need to reward law following, not breaking. Being principled renders the most gain.
@realDonaldTrump LOCK TRUMP UP
Stemming from @realDonaldTrump comments. Do something already. #annapolisshooting #DoYourJob

How do you find snakes? You hire a snake charmer. RR hung himself today. He is done. He did what we needed him to do. Show us all the snakes. He has. They are done. #DarktoLight #WWG1WGA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump calls America's journalists the enemy of the people......he has no soul.
@PeterAlexander you focus so much on the BS and not on the results his administration, if this is the kind of stuff your researching he has defeated you! @realDonaldTrump
Another great interview by @stephensackur though @JamesComeyFBI is slippery - he colluded with @realDonaldTrump to his shame, and handed the presidency to a man who makes us nostalgic for the intellect of @GeorgeWBush__ @BBCHARDtalk
@realDonaldTrump This is your FBI/DOJ, its very disappointing its now on you to give faith to your supporters you need to declassify the doc.s Congress wants .Don't let your supports down #DrainTheSwamp
And you thought coward @realDonaldTrump would step up and make an intelligent statement before he could find a way to make it about him because.......what?
@realDonaldTrump and his rhetoric have proven to be dangerous to citizens. @SpeakerRyan is complicit as he LET IT CONTINUE WITHOUT CENSURE!
@realDonaldTrump is basically a very troubled middle school mean girl, he (and others) scream from the mountaintops fabricating all sorts of nonsense about what democrats do and want done without ever having any proof beyond the fact that they made it up & these morons eat it up
Almost as wrongheaded as saying @DNC planned it, so the media would BLAME it on @realDonaldTrump . We are all Americans. We are not one another's enemy. There are enough people in this world that hate ALL of us, left and right!
@realDonaldTrump No love for the unloving. No civility for the uncivil No tolerance for the intolerant. No respect for the disrespectful.
YAY NRA, right @realDonaldTrump ?
@realDonaldTrump Whereare the babies? #YouBumblngFool ! #GoAway #TicTocTicToc
@realDonaldTrump Does your base love you or Putin?
The press attacks @realDonaldTrump constantly and his supporters! THE name calling is a list so long, who can remember all the names we have been called?
Jammy Dodgers are releasing a special edition for when @realDonaldTrump visits the UK! #Trump pic.twitter.com/FB9o9a2AJa
I'm going out on a limb and stating that if this Republican majority Senate fails to confirm @realDonaldTrump nominee for #SCOTUS regardless of who ever on that list it is, it will be the single greatest political failure in history.
But, @PressSec , didn't your boss, @realDonaldTrump , label the media the enemy of the people? You know, like the Nazis did.
@realDonaldTrump I watched Wray and Rosie today, Wray thinks he is Elliott Ness (Untouchable) and Rosiestein thinks it is funny that he is holding documents. Both are smug bureaucrats who think they are elite.
@realDonaldTrump Russia continues to attack our election systems and you ignore your own intelligence community and staff about it. You are either in denial, or complicit of their actions. #trumpisatraitor #TrumpTreason #trumpisaCriminal #moneylaundering #ObstructionOfJustice
@realDonaldTrump It's sickening. Today's shooting is in my backyard. I blame trump, every day, trashing the media on Twitter, every day. #FUCKTRUMP #MURDERER #MURDERER #MURDERER
WOW. Just...wow. How many times have you attacked the press during your "briefings?" How many times have you defended @realDonaldTrump 's inciting violence against "the Enemy of the People?" You're complicit, Sarah.
Unfortunately this shooting is a DIRECT RESULT from @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP hate speech. @cathymcmorris your no better by remaining silent on these issues.. shame on you, shame on @GOP and to hell with @realDonaldTrump . pic.twitter.com/s0qUt55Ai0
You know @realDonaldTrump is calling putin, kim jong and bannon Laughing about how he's pushed people into murdering reporters. The psycho puppet master is probably giggling like a school girl about how he can control his sheep. #hitlertrumpisrising

Agree 100% there might be a better qualified person to become our President. Just being open minded... sorry @realDonaldTrump
You do realize, Justice Kennedy is retiring knowing full well that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump President Trump gets to pick his replacement. I hope he announces his pick tonight or tomorrow.
They are fishing, hoping to find something...they were so close to being able to hide all of their crimes with Hillary elected that they are now having to find something to argue for impeachment of @realDonaldTrump rather than allow him to turn this country around
@realDonaldTrump @TGowdySC @seanhannity @FoxNews @foxandfriends Sen Trey Gowdy nailed it today to Rod Rosenstein if you have evidence of collusion provided it to Congress if not then close this investigation our country is sick of this investigation. #TotalWitchHunt #ImpeachRod

You're disgusting and part of the problem by defending @realDonaldTrump and his vile rhetoric.
You and the entire GOP are complicit!! You never condemned @realDonaldTrump though he has declared war on the media. He called the media dangerous to the US. His Supporters also believe that and called for violence, just two days ago!! You have blood on your hands!!
Do you know where else journalists are gunned down for telling the truth? Russia. Putin kills journalists. @realDonaldTrump wants to impress his handler. #MiloYiannopoulos is his mouthpiece and his dog whistle.

@jstephenson1984 I followed you - I felt bad. So few followers and so much to say. You don't get much satisfaction from trying to interact with @CBCNews @CBCAlerts @realDonaldTrump and the like. It's like yelling into an empty box. Not too rewarding. Feel free to follow back.
We're one supreme court appointment away from the long "fundamentally transforming the USA" nightmarish dream of radical leftists being flushed down the toilet for two generations. And the maestro @realDonaldTrump is overseeing it. Life is good. #MAGA

I'm waiting for "great piece" on why American journalists are "enemy of the people," as @realDonaldTrump described them. #Trump created this atmosphere of hatred toward media members who work hard to report truth. But it's clear "truth" is uncomfortable for lawbreakers.
Except maybe @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump #Lies . All. The. Time.
@realDonaldTrump life is an incorrect existence.
Wow!she backs us up 2 stnd up & question wat is going on bhnd closed doors& she gtz death threats! @realDonaldTrump incites violence dring his campaign&uses hate words during his presidency and no death threats? where did @RepMaxineWaters gt death threats from? @StormyDaniels pt2
Let me be clear to ALL members of @GOP @SenateGOP : Lies & attacks via social media by @realDonaldTrump is tearing USA apart. Note: It is a violation of applicable Law to intimidate ANY investigator (ex: @FBI ) "under color of (your) Official Office", @TGowdySC @BobGoodlatte6 etc.
