Make no mistake, @realDonaldTrump will win another Term as #POTUS #Democrats have no candidate & no Platform other than #Hate and mindless rhetoric Programed by #Globalist Elites #BuildTheWall #MAGA #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Next thing you know, @realDonaldTrump will try and sell the idea of Indentured Servitude for the refugees being their way of paying for the Internment facilities.
MS13 was born in the USA. Why aren't you stalking them about their birth certificates like you have done for years with the Obama family&have never apologized or let up? @realDonaldTrump
I have felt it. I feel it right now as @POTUS @realDonaldTrump orders those same heinous actions of one Adolph Hitler and his regime. There should be no doubt in anybody's mind that the USA you have all lived in, is gone. Trump needs to get gone.

@TheJordanRachel is a rising star. She seems to be a non-conforming, individualist, who thinks for herself and supports President Trump. Her tweets are definitely worth reading. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
If you really want to help @realDonaldTrump end it all, tell the mofo to resign.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump I will be in Virginia in August. I will be sure to go to #RedHen and thank them for the patriotism.
@MichaelCohen212 you should give those tapes to Mueller, #HelpUrselfOut you did dirt for @realDonaldTrump and he has left you for "done you're on your own!" What's good for the goose is good for the gander!
More evidence of #LeftistPropaganda from @CNN and the useless organization called the @UN . The unemployment rate under @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is the lowest in 40 years.
@realDonaldTrump For what reason would Clarence Thomas cozy up to Trump? What is in it for him at this point?

@realDonaldTrump you know you really are a piece of shit that should be separated from your family,or maybe Melania should be raped or Barron kidnapped,then u might possibly get it,your father was a fucking immigrant goof cock sucker!!!!
Serious question, is there any chance @realDonaldTrump will go to jail once sanity returns to this country? All tyrants fall. There will come a day where all these people need to be held accountable.
Character limitation clarification, @realdonaldtrump is an entitled, ignorant bigot, but calculated in persona and ethos manipulation with his younger interviews, the apprentice bankruptcy recoveries (part luck), and understanding that any publicity is good publicity.
@realDonaldTrump is in the palm of the Russians this is clearly obvious from Syria, from the elections...and the list goes on. Every route you go and explore it always leads to the Russians.

@realDonaldTrump @GOP We never had fake news until we had a fake president-now that Putin's bff is in office-nothing is being done about further interference in our future elections
Thank God ACA was repealed. No one should ever be forced by law to buy healthcare. Thank you @realDonaldTrump
Oh. It is torture. No doubt. Crimes Against Humanity too. Let's kick this bucket of warm spit to the Hague. There's an open invitation and room waiting for @realDonaldTrump

So like a gay man at a bakery, @PressSec was refused service based on belief, and was deported out of a restaurant where she wasnt wanted? #PoeticJustice 4 the @WhiteHouse .

Racism. On the heart and in the mind of Fake @POTUS & his minions. Red Hen was polite. @PressSec was polite. @PressSec guests were polite. More than could be said for you & @realDonaldTrump . Remind me; who exactly do you serve?
BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump prepared to name #PermitPatty as White House Press Secretary, when current @PressSec #SarahSanders vacates the position.

@realDonaldTrump Just missed my flight home from Las Vegas because Air Force One delayed our takeoff by an hour. If only you had a hotel to put up all the people you just put off
The nastiness toward those who work for @realDonaldTrump is a reflection of HIS nastiness.

@realDonaldTrump YOU BASTARD LIER NAZI
Trump loses his mind in a rally in Nevada, campaigning for Heller. He stoops once again to the lowest level by referring to a senate candidate by a derogatory name-demonizing the person because she is a democrat. That is the kind of America of @realdonaldtrump and @GOP . Vote Blue
@realDonaldTrump U Don't Even Realize WHAT U DID. Went 2 MORTAL ENEMY & BEGGED 4 HELP. BEGGED. Cuz Vlad Is CSMF & Was AFRAID OF A WOMAN, VLAD GOT U ELECTED. WE WERE ROBBED. Never Saw Such A COWARD, TRUMP. Even Ur Dumby Wife, Hates U. Melania Can't STAND U. WE CANT EITHER. RESIGN

Yes sir. @realDonaldTrump got 3 hostages back from NoKo & Kim Jong Un to send remains of our fallen Warriors home. This alone is remarkable, yet you seldom hear anything about it, for all the other lib left lies being aired.
You forgot to mention yourself in that list. Dementia is setting in? Getting old? God bless our most wonderful handsome hot wonderful savior President @realDonaldTrump
@RedHenLex perhaps our military are no longer welcome in your restaurant? They work for the commander-in-chief @realDonaldTrump .
Everyone, including @realDonaldTrump , agrees that not all immigrants are ms13.
@realDonaldTrump You suck! I support the @FBI I support Mr. @BobSMueller
Why are people surprised by @realDonaldTrump & his administration? They are only galvanising what the USA is, has been & always will be. A country built on the back of racism & regulated as such. Nothing has essentially changed, just exposed more.
So true, my family ALWAYS voted Democrat and my grandmother was very heavy in the local political races in my state. I was the one black sheep of the family voting republican. Then to my SHOCK they all voted for @realDonaldTrump !!! The Dems have to be real messed up indeed lol
@realDonaldTrump And every Republican who votes no should be voted out of office in November!
Thank you Red Hen for standing up for American principles. And letting the trumpsters know they will no less Niger be tolerated. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Ever been to The Red Hen restaurant in Lexington Viginia ? Strongly recommend the food there
Ahhhhhhhhh ... So THAT'S what @realDonaldTrump plans on doing with the children he's jailing ... Forced labor camps.
I'm surprised this hasn't happened before.Was writing my script for @realDonaldTrump 's visit to Las Vegas, and when I wrote the "In Las Vegas, I'm Chip Yost, KTLA 5 News" line, the word processor changed it to "Chip Lost" ..yeah...no need to pile on the punch lines! pic.twitter.com/OLexGurgvn
