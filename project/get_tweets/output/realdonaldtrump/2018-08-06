2. told candidate Trump of Russian interference affecting his campaign. Instead they set up a sting based on a fake dossier & spied on his people & raided his lawyer's office & home. Feinstein has never been investigated. @realDonaldTrump

If only he hadn't been nominated by @realDonaldTrump who could possibly be an enemy to the country. Maybe we should get back to him later. We wouldn't want to stain Kavanaugh's good name by association with a traitor. And after Merrick Garland gets his due nomination.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump love what u are doing as president but please....STOP THE LYING....please!!!
Looks like Trump supporters to me. Talk about low IQ. @realDonaldTrump
I doubt the resident of White House @realDonaldTrump gives a damn about @Rosie & her groups protest / only effective tool ( without foreign election meddling) when elections are held make the right choices
Did you and @realDonaldTrump sign as well?? Just think, how many Americans could your family employ?

Textbook racist. @realDonaldTrump #Hardball
I predict @realDonaldTrump conditions for Mueller meeting will be no questions on: collusion, meddling, high crimes, misdemeanors, low crimes, felonies, treason, "mainstream facts", wildfire management, water in general, and chess (in arbitrary dimensions)

The Left = Antifa, abolish ICE, impeach @realDonaldTrump , raise taxes and appease our enemies. The Right = Peace through strength, lower taxes, a booming economy and low crime. Not hard to understand.... #MAGA
Nope. We're with @realDonaldTrump to the end. Where, exactly would we revolt to?

I've said this before and it's a great quote. When the last men and women of the last great war die, the next great war will be beginning. It's already started and @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump are fighting for the enemy, like the rest of the Republicans.
After Rand Paul meeting, Russian lawmakers agree to Washington visit. Good to see not everyone in Congress disagrees with @realDonaldTrump about relations with Russia. https:// politi.co/2LZz0S4 via @politico @RandPaul @GovMikeHuckabee @ShannonBream

If Obamas economy was strong, @realDonaldTrump 's economy is incredibly collossal
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Is THE PEOPLE surprised anymore that the lies jsut keep piling up @SenateGOP @HouseGOP it is PAST TIME for the GOP to stop sitting on their hands and take our government BACK before the people take it back in November
This about sums it up! The left always protected Obama, this man was the man just because of his color and did nothing for his people. While @realDonaldTrump has done more in two years for minorities and gets slammed for it. @dbongino @RealCandaceO @RealJamesWoods @Mark923to25 pic.twitter.com/WmydqlTzOw

When @realDonaldTrump , @realDailyWire and @FoxNews gets on another platform, I'm there!
My day was made hearing about all of @realDonaldTrump 's campaign managers crimes. I also enjoyed it when he threw @DonaldJTrumpJr under the bus @IngrahamAngle
@realDonaldTrump Declassify everything!
Strange how @realDonaldTrump name isn't mentioned once since investigation was supposed to be about him and muh Russia!! #DeepState

@realDonaldTrump will be so mad.
All this will do is make the right stronger, just like every other attempt to silence opposition over the past couple of years. The left cries wolf, @realDonaldTrump 's ratings go up? Don't you simpletons see the pattern? #1stAmendment #LiberalLunacy
Funny that a lot of the people that were mad at the #NeverTrump #Republicans for not supporting @realDonaldTrump after he was nominated, are now mad that @JoinTravisAllen didn't get the nom and are refusing to support @TheRealJohnHCox . #Hypocrisy at its best. @LAGOP #Cox4Governor
Quick Reminder - @realDonaldTrump didn't suddenly 'become' vile, corrupt & treasonous, he's been that way ALL ALONG. The MSM is just opening their DAMNED EYES to it.
https:// youtu.be/C1WVqZ4f3VQ Who really cares what your losing paper thinks? @nytimes We damn sure don't, and EVERYONE, BRING YOUR KIDS TO A TRUMP RALLY! THEY'RE FUN, EXCITING AND PATRIOTIC! GREAT KNOWLEDGE GAINED, THEY'LL NEVER HEAR IT ON THE MSM!THIS IS HISTORICAL! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
Not to mention all this immigration non-sense has been around long before @realDonaldTrump ever got elected. How does blaming him help to fix the situation?
That is because, in addition to working for the #TRAITOR @realDonaldTrump they have a nice little sideline in #TREASON for which #Putin sends them nice big #Rosneft checks!
This is perfect example of the CA state of mind. Celebs like @HamillHimself are worrying about nonsense while the state literally burns. Luckily @realDonaldTrump is concerned about the real problems. #maga #Trump2020 pic.twitter.com/43hn8SiXuK
@realDonaldTrump 4. After 10 years with full employment, paid taxes, and no criminal record both the security number becomes permanent, so does the licence. Any violations of above means automatic revocation and a deportation hearing
Please RT to @realDonaldTrump to tick him off
@realDonaldTrump Loser.
No we banned together to elected @realDonaldTrump so we are still winning and you guys are still mad @RealAlexJones for helping him
@realDonaldTrump you ratted out you own son wow, who is safe on your staff
@realDonaldTrump Destroys Every Single Thing He Touches. #VoteThemAllOut #BlueWave
Like a certain vain religion, a fanatical belief that all should think as they do. Calling themselves "non-binary" they are far too stupid to see how their binary actions put @realDonaldTrump in office, have the nation uniting against them.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump one message from trump on @getongab to promote it all his followers start using it tell freinds and they tell friends. And then @Twitter is in shit street
It's actually worse than that. I follow @realDonaldTrump on this platform and I see NONE of his tweets, unless I specifically visit his page. And he's the President of the US. Also true for several other accounts I follow. #shadowban
They've got nothing they can say that I haven't heard a million times. It's tired. Yet they persist. Doesn't bother me. These are the same people who think Putin is trustworthy and @realDonaldTrump is a champion of the working class. So everything they say is guaranteed...
@DelPercioS thank you for using your platform to call out the racism and lunacy of @realDonaldTrump and many of his followers.

@dbongino @seanhannity @marklevinshow I used to be considered a Republican and my wife a liberal, now we're on the out and supporting @realDonaldTrump I guess we are now considered members of the Trump party now

@realDonaldTrump Charles Manson would be proud of you. You're closer to his Helter Skelter than he ever was.
@realDonaldTrump Feel the noose getting tighter around your neck?
@realDonaldTrump Racist-in-Chief. Hater-in-Chief. Moron-in-Chief. Misogynist-in-Chief. Liar-in-Chief. Traitor-in-Chief. Obstructionist-in-Chief. and worst POTUS ever. you're right - you are the best at everything you attempt.
If there is something good about @realDonaldTrump being POTUS it's this.. Racism is big in this country and the light has exposed it. The Republican party is tied to Russia bigly... FOX network is the enemy of the people because they support Trump and cover for his lies...
Lets thank maxine waters , ted lieu, tha mayor garcetti, and all those great dem leaders of LA. @drwright4congr1 @RealOmarNavarro @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity
At the same time, @Twitter @Facebook and the rest should at the very least display an icon identifying each tweet from anyone they exempt from their own standards. Like scumbag @realDonaldTrump .
Now... to ban @realDonaldTrump Permanently.

I wish @realDonaldTrump gets re-elected so when I get the medal of honor, I want him to give it to me.
Between ANTIFA and Silicon Valley censorship news today, I think the Left is about to wake a sleeping giant. I have never been more fired-up than I am today. I think @realDonaldTrump is about to take action against both--and should. #AlexJones #CandiceOwens

Why does @realDonaldTrump call Labron James dumb and other such insults? He wants to bring him down to Trumps level of lies and stupidity he shows us every day when he opens his mouth or tweets. World leaders see this and know his not worth a penny.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump I advised that you stop tweeting about Mueller's investigation, I said it only gives the fake-news media more to talk about. But... With November right around the corner you should only be talking about candidates, accomplishments and plans. #MAGA
Youve been a marked man since you supported @realDonaldTrump These people fail to realize you hated Bush W, broke into Boho grove and exposed that whole thing....Nixon sucked but he knew boho grove was not something he wanted. Almost like trump and epstein.
