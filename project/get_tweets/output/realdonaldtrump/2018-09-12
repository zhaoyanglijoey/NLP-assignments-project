Agree with @CharlesHurt - A large % of #Hispanics VOTED FOR President @realDonaldTrump because Hispanic-Americans DO NOT WANT gang members & drug dealers coming illegally into their US neighborhoods. And MANY Hispanics FLED VIOLENT GANGS & DRUG DEALERS in their home country!

@realDonaldTrump & yes that means Kelly, Kellyanne, Pence, maybe likely Mattis, the whole ring. Only Pompeii & Carson, Ross I only trust. Rest are establishment, elites. Take tax cut but don't want to do what explicitly was promised. A big beautiful wall & enforcement of laws.
And 7 years since 9/11/12. I am still waiting for Justice to be served to those that lied, covered up, gave stand down orders, and are responsible for 4 dead in Benghazi. God Bless those who disobeyed orders to save 30+ that awful night. Please @realDonaldTrump JUSTICE

Unsurprising continuous diversion into mid-level bureaucracy while @realDonaldTrump POTUS lies to the American people every day. He lies, then lies about his lies. And you want us to worry about these texts? Such BS.
@chelseahandler you need to get on the @JoyVBehar train with @Alyssa_Milano and start kissing @realDonaldTrump ass.
I lived through hurricane relief. No matter how well executed any FEMA plan might be ; it is painful slow and tedious. Once the victims realize @realDonaldTrump is lying and help is not on the way; they will join the blue wave. Trump will screw this up bad #HurricaneFlorence2018

The fact is @realDonaldTrump won the 2016 Presidential election fair & square in accordance with US Constitution & other applicable laws of the USA. @HillaryClinton was not robbed the Presidency in any shape or form.
@realDonaldTrump the same amount of people died in Puerto Rico as they did when terrorists flew airplanes into the World Trade Center. That is not a success. #PuertoRico #911remembrance #resign
let me guess, did #Anonymous actually trick @realDonaldTrump into signing it? what did you have to tell him it was? an order for well-done steaks?

Trump is a mental weakling. HE is the president, not his neo-liberal and neo-conservative staffers. If he is so easily moved from the populist positions that got him elected, he should not be given a 2nd term. #BuildTheWall @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter

An educated guess would be that you voted for @realDonaldTrump - it would make complete sense. Allegedly, obviously.
Unbelievable... the are still out to get @realDonaldTrump with their liberal propaganda lies and deception... All Social media and MSM are out to twist facts and hide positive information in such a way to deceive the simple minded causing hate and anger to grow...
