I don't know why he would trust them. CBS is FAKE NEWS and only wants to destroy him. They don't deserve a interview from our @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump @RealSheriffJoe -- I guess Trump was busy, but apparently Sheriff Joe likes the hookers at the bunny ranch -- Trump's probably been to the Bunny Ranch a lot ...
@realDonaldTrump Don, love you man, keep up the good work. As someone who voted for you, thank you for keeping our promises. Now can you please stop with the petty tweets? Take the high road man!
Do you think you could string together a coherent sentence? Or answer a question? About #climatechange #PuertoRico #Yemen #Syria #Rohingya #Kavanaugh #Debt #ChildrenInCages #gunviolence ? #VoteThemAllOut #Midterms2018 #TheResistance #WeAreTheMob #Quisling @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Stress to Am. that Immigration not a pol. issue , nor is the wall. As commander in chief that you must take part of defense budget and move it to the border for wall our safety and our long-run econ. survival. Or use senate vote of 50 after election.
You know, for someone who has gained so much weight & has gotten so bald & ugly in his old age, you'd think @realDonaldTrump would be hesitant to bring up people's looks. It makes everyone super aware of how old, fat, bald & ugly he is. Dumb strategy, Donald!
@realDonaldTrump RESIGN. Your idiocy may be contagious beyond just the Republican turncoats. RESIGN
Sounds like retribution to me. @realDonaldTrump no matter what you do we will always remember that 4K people died needlessly in Puerto Rico under your watch.
@realDonaldTrump You are a bad person. Come on? Your legacy will be shit because you have no values, no morals. Your even destroying the environment. Don't care if your grandchildren have a world to grow up in. Your parents raised a creep.
@realDonaldTrump @VP @parscale @SenateDems This is ridiculous! It's got to stop, we've got American's that need our help before we support a horde of illegal aliens. #BuildtheWall #Fundthewall #MAGA #SecureTheBorder #KAG #Trump #WWG1WGA #WalkAway #AmericaFirst #Veterans1st

I am reminded so often what an absolute digrace @realDonaldTrump is. All of his supporters are either absolute morons or have something personal to gain and don't care about anyone else that might be affected by his actions. He still has supporters... It's so insane.
Well, @realDonaldTrump didn't think she was a #horseface when he was inside her.
Dems ARE the party of Hypocrisy, Lies & Violence! Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Cory Booker, known offenders; Feinstein, Hitlery, Liz Warren, known liars; Antifa, The MOB...need we say more! @realDonaldTrump @VP @FLOTUS @StephenMillerAL @PressSec @senatemajldr
@realDonaldTrump LMAO
@realDonaldTrump You might need to give John Cox another endorsement for Governor of California. My understanding is he's gaining on Gavin Newsome but still a long way to go. Think your endorsement might help him!
New World Global Order, namely the Democrats, Soros, wants Women to take over so we can disqualify the more physically strong of the genders. Take away our guns so they can rule as they want. Anyone following these Fascists are Dumb Dumber Dumbest. @RealDonaldTrump @Potus

@FoxNews , President @realDonaldTrump talks on foreign policies between it the N. Korea, Syria, Iran axis and their sucess..
There it is, and right before the midterms. Mitch McConnell is betting that the @GOP base just simply follow the Peid Piper, regardless of where he leads. This is the largest wealth transfer from the poorest to the richest that America has ever seen. @realDonaldTrump is a FRAUD! pic.twitter.com/xi0nXI1t5J
They're more focused on money and not on people. "We can't afford Medicare for all." People don't ask to be born, let alone with health issues. We owe it to ALL neighbors. #SinglePayer #MedicareforALL #LoveYourNeighbor , not your money! @GOP @realDonaldTrump @vp @senatemajldr
@realDonaldTrump The Saudis Crown Prince is guilty as hell. Don't try to fool Americans It might be the straw that breaks the camel's back Freeze all support to the Saudis at once
No I actually believe everything that I see online and take it at face value! I don't need to research that @realDonaldTrump is not 239 lbs and that he gets sprayed down exactly as pictured. It is all a joke, just like the #tRump world. #America
This nigga @realDonaldTrump really called this female horse face w no care
@realDonaldTrump Only an infantile jerk, (that means BABY Donald), resorts to nursery school level name calling.. Horseface? Bet you didn't call her that when she was tasting your mushroom...or your pea sized nuts.
This must be #FakeNews . @realDonaldTrump always takes responsibility for his failures. #TinyTrump
. @realDonaldTrump is your guy. Why don't you take it up with him?
@realDonaldTrump This is insane. I see Soros.
@realDonaldTrump is a COWARD who surrenders to America's enemies. I've never seen such a WEAK, sorry excuse for a "man" in my life. He can't even run a household, much less a nation.
@realDonaldTrump love it
. @stevenmnuchin1 - Following Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder, show moral leadership and ditch the Saudi @FIIKSA conference! @USTreasury @RealDonaldTrump Withdraw immediately from the Future Investment Initiative conference until the truth comes to light.
@realDonaldTrump Vegas 2018 was a success. Jimmy was great. Please thank him for the hard work he put in to making our vacation amazing. pic.twitter.com/dog1tciixw
When has @realDonaldTrump accepted responsibility for anything negative? Bankruptcies? Affairs? Divorces? Racism? Sexual assault? Never. Trump is so weak, he can't handle the truth. That's why he has to lie all the time.
https:// youtu.be/9OEcgenPzGw @realDonaldTrump you need to fire the top people in the FBI and the justice department start over if you're getting rid of Mattis put in Petraeus please

@realDonaldTrump are you really going to let Rosenstein and his band of scumbags off the hook? Midterms coming up tick, tock, tick, tock!
@SenRonJohnson mr spineless, are you going to fall in line like a nice little boy for @realDonaldTrump as he ignores yet another blatant attack by hostile power...we are sucking up to Russia and Saudi while our real allies are given a stiff arm. You have a bone saw to lend?
@realDonaldTrump could have saved us BILLIONS in legal fees over the years. "OJ, did you stab anyone?" "Nope." "Osama, did you attack us on 9/11?" "Nope." "Brett, did you assault anyone?" "Nope." "MBS, did you kill a journalist?" "Nope." Cases closed. #nocoldcasesintrumpland

My thing is, why dies @realDonaldTrump even care? Poe doesn't. There is nothing more important for him to concern himself with?
Time to focus on Iran, Turkey, shia terror groups as possible guilty in #khashoogi affair. #MuslimBrotherhood , #Iran @RT_Erdogan @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecPompeo
@ScottAdamsSays I imagine #horseface / #creepypornlawyer #GoFundMe donors of over $500k in support of their @POTUS lawsuit will be screaming at the sky when they find out they actually just paid legal fees for @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you are the greatest #POTUS in my lifetime - ad i'm no spring chicken ;-) You understand the TERRIBLE longterm affects of not stopping these "coached" migrants/immigrants! Not a good for us or them. #WWG1WGA #RedWave2018
Nothing new just one more corrupt government official rapping our treasury. Something that has become very common in @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS crime family regime. 2018 is the year we destroy @GOP . 2019 is the year we impeach, indict, imprison Trump.

@realDonaldTrump @potus HAS REQUESTED @SenWarren PER PEE ON HIM, SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE MONTH TO PROVIDE DNA. I THINK HE IS LYING AGAIN.
Oh boy. I think @realDonaldTrump needs some Aloe Vera for that massive #burn !
@realDonaldTrump is a fucking coward. Any other president EVER would stand up to that murdering shithead. #CowardTrump
So very mature. Is @realDonaldTrump REALLY the president or is this some nightmare we're all living? I feel like I'm in an alternate universe. Trump calls Stormy Daniels 'horseface'; she fires back with 'tiny' and notes the president's 'shortcomings' http:// flip.it/IBCeq5
Would you be alright with your two daughters having sex on camera to earn a living? I agree @realDonaldTrump needs to change his ways, but you should be prepared to stand corrected as well. Leading is not easy or Moses, Noah, & Jonah wouldn't have made excuses to avoid the job.
@FLOTUS you must be so proud of @realDonaldTrump . Clearly he has signed on to your #BeBest initiative. #horseface your husband has no class #MushroomTrump
. #TrickleDown did NOT work for #Reagan ! It did NOT work for #Bush (remember 2008???) and it is NOT working 4 @realDonaldTrump ! Trillion dollar tax breaks for Billionaires and Corps are only hurting working Americans! Wages are down, healthcare, groceries & gas are up #VoteBlue
@realDonaldTrump hey orange assface Shut your piehole! You are a moron as Rex said. You are a horrid person, and you insult people and are mentally sick! Your wife is robot face
Yes @realDonaldTrump , the people who murdered a reporter are so misunderstood.

The Saudis murdered an American based journalist in an astonishingly gruesome manner and @realDonaldTrump is aiding and abetting the cover up. #JamalKhashoggi
Implausible denial that only @realDonaldTrump will buy! did Pompeo manage to keep a straight face when he was told this?
Should never happen, I'm sorry. But, you're enabling of @realDonaldTrump makes problem worse. Any @GOP sen) has power to make POTUS pay legislative price for lying/demagoging. You could force @senatemajldr to put #CountryOverParty . @MaxBoot / @ananavarro should'nt be only voices
Why am I no longer receiving notifications when @realDonaldTrump @POTUS tweet....i have notifications turned on...hmmmm thought @Jack said he does not censor

@realDonaldTrump I really need to say you, that @JuanOrlandoH is terrible and all of us wants to live out of Honduras because of him.

Trump tweetstorm today! No mention of historically high national debt. But, Mitch and the minions are talking about the *need* to cut Medicare and Social Security. Everyone knows the tax cut is the real debt driver. @realDonaldTrump
