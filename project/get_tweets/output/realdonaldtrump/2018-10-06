Congrats to Judge Brett Kavanaugh on his appointment to the Supreme Court. #MAGA #KAG2020 @realDonaldTrump
Vote. If there isn't a #BlueWave in November, this country will have lost its soul and @realDonaldTrump and the forces of evil will have won.
@realDonaldTrump please use the wall as a show of force that America will never accept criminal acts as our way of life. A sovereign country must have borders. for the security of a sovereign nation its borders must be inforced @tepessink @JudgeJeanine @VP
The @GOP Goal to remain in #PoliticalPower through #Perpetuity and Make @realDonaldTrump Amerika into a @Russia Satellite Country with a @Republican @KremlinRussia_E #Politburo @POTUS #AuthoritarianDictatorship Dictating Unwanted Right Wing Laws and #Fanatical #Evangelist Morals

@SarahKSilverman it must suck to be you.....so much losing.....while @realDonaldTrump keeps WINNING.....bwahahaha...deal with it...
Yes, just like our dear @realDonaldTrump , always putting other's interests ahead of his own. NOT! #PendejoDelDia
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS you will go down in history as the first fascist US president. you may also go down in history as the LAST US PRESIDENT. will dance on your grave, fascist.
@realDonaldTrump You are the worst person of today. I wish you would get impeached, you hypocritical, racist, lying piece of shit. You are a disgusting pig. A fraud. A fool. And you deserve hell for all your crimes. Your retarded administration and you can go to hell.
Remember, @realDonaldTrump is under federal/state investigations for Obstruction of Justice, Conspiracy Against the United States, election tampering, RICO crimes, tax evasion/fraud, international humanitarian crimes, and hopefully Treason. Mueller is coming for you, Trumps.

What better way to spend a Saturday night tossing back a cold one, celebrating the confirmation of #JusticeKavanaugh and watching the Greatest @POTUS at a rally #MAGA America is #Winning Thank You @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/cXT5vlMTba
This is leadership. Because of @realDonaldTrump , America is BACK!
Watch how many conservative cases to restrict or repeal rights now get pushed up to the Supreme Court. This is why the @GOP sucked at @realDonaldTrump 's teat and debased their own party's legacy. Morals and ethics mean nothing when their regressive agenda is at stake.
What a great day to be an American, a Republican, and a Conservative. Congratulations to Justice Kavanaugh, a very brave and good man. Thank you @realDonaldTrump , the best President we have had in my 63 years. Winning is bliss! Now we must VOTE next month. #KavanaughConfirmed
Hollywood has been so far up @realDonaldTrump ass they haven't produced a decent film in 3 years! pic.twitter.com/GrjOvlkUlG
@realDonaldTrump Thank you so much for getting Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court! MAGA
The @FBI allowed themselves to be use by @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP #shame
You, @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump and the rest just cant take people actually exercising theit Constitutional RIGHTS. Screw u
Anyone who ever said "we can handle 4 years of @realDonaldTrump , it'll be worth it to teach @TheDemocrats a lesson," please go ahead and punch yourself in the face. Thank you. @HillaryClinton @SenSanders
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump well done on #KavanaughConfirmed . Promises kept. Marxism goes back ten steps
Amen and God Bless your Father @realDonaldTrump for saving this Country from the hell it was heading!
In Kansas, @realDonaldTrump revels in Supreme Court win for 'squeaky clean' Kavanaugh over 'arsonist' Democrats #scotus https:// buff.ly/2pGyAmc

After @realDonaldTrump finishes his 2nd term, @VP Mike Pence will carry his torch for the next 8 years. He will #KeepMakingAmericaGreat !
@realDonaldTrump You are such a jackass
@realDonaldTrump what nation do you represent? Because clearly you don't represent the United States.
@realDonaldTrump Trump I swear that I will do everything in my power to bring you down. You are and alwsys will be a joke to the world and when you are dead no one will care. History has already declared you the worst NON PRESIDENTIAL PERSON EVER
what a rigged @OfficialPDPNig because @atiku did not get his way @realDonaldTrump we see that they are extending the selection...pathetic..this is a selection not an election .. @StateDept ..so unethical these people there @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg deadlines mean nothing to them.. pic.twitter.com/K0OTAOZG1q

I expect it from misogynists like @realDonaldTrump but @SenatorCollins must realise that the confirmation has undermined both the Supreme Court and the testimony of victims of sexual assault, Her vote also endorses the treatment of Blasey Ford by Trump and his stooges #Kavanaugh
I hope my rapist becomes the highest judge in the land -- said noone ever #CancelKavanaugh #SupremeCourt #RapistKavanaugh @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow #mediocrewhitemen
@realDonaldTrump trump = SATAN
@realDonaldTrump Don't forget to PAY the protestors.
Violence always started by the left and white supremacists. Not @realDonaldTrump followers.
A lot of people carry your vids on their pages. I carry all of yours on my topics Gab page & main pages: http:// gab.ai/Gypsy124 They may quiet us, but they'll never silence us!! @realDonaldTrump @GeorgeMNasif @prayingmedic @1CitizenSailor

@realDonaldTrump hey congrats on the North America Trade deal! But as a Canadian, do you know how long we had to fight to get the Super Bowl with US commercials?
Hey! If @BrettKavanaugh and dirty @realDonaldTrump have nothing to do later, they can always qualify as ISIS members! Don't laugh! They're both eminently qualified! pic.twitter.com/FuTJGaeQfX
This is what Democracy looks like. Thank you @realDonaldTrump . #KavanaughConfirmed pic.twitter.com/p2ZU3wb1ld
If . @realDonaldTrump is running true to form, what he's REALLY saying is that he's 100% certain that #DrFord was and is 100% accurate in her identification of her attacker. #KavanaughFarce
@realDonaldTrump You said aboard AF1 that women are "extremely happy" about the Kavenaugh confirmation. No, we're not, and you'll find out how unhappy we are on November 6. 2018! Put that in your pipe and smoke it or whatever else you're snorting. #BlueWave2018
I am so happy that the real Democratic party is showing it's face. All this nonsense is good for the Right, it has solidified us. But what is better? They have driven the Independent middle over and brought some on the Left with them. #MAGA #Kavanaugh #RedWave @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/oGH1iE3YIX
I love how the Dems are so up and arms about @realDonaldTrump mocking Christine Blasey Ford (which I happen to not agree with) meanwhile 2 minutes ago the Dems did a 13 minute skit on SNL mocking Kavanaugh for getting emotional about his life being ruined by false accusations.
@realDonaldTrump NEEDS TO DO THIS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO THAT IT WOULD BE A FELONY!!!!!!!
They know no bounds. Amoral for baby killing. @realDonaldTrump
Lovin it! Conservatives are sick & tired of Being sick & tired ! Keep it up Republicans & THANK GOD EVERYDAY for @realDonaldTrump for Saving Our Country!
@realDonaldTramp Hey Donald i want you be on President My Name is Demi don t think about Hilary she wrong? i liked you Donald you want you part of President? i Voting to @realDonaldTrump
No, trust me @realDonaldTrump ,women despise you and are very unhappy.
We the people are just getting started. We elected @realDonaldTrump for a reason and you are just seeing the begining. He was elected to save the republic.. God bless @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @JohnCornyn How the hell is it that the UK banned George Soros from the UK but yet we allow him to try and destroy us like he tried doing in the UK?!?!?!?!?
You liar from Rotland!!! @realDonaldTrump
I find it very sad that even if Melania or Ivanna Trump were in Ms. Ford's place and raped by Brett Kavannaugh, that @realDonaldTrump would still swear that rapist in. It just shows everyone in our country how much Trump cares about women.
Wait until the elections and the next protest, which will make the last Women's March look like a church picnic: @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump will be in jail but his corruption will linger like the stench of republican lies #justicekavanaugh
Thanks @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @POTUSPress @POTUS THANK YOU FOR STANDING STRONG TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Todo mi apoyo a @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Please come to Georgia and campaign for Kemp! It's too close for comfort. Abrams will make this State a sanctuary state. We cannot let that happen! Congratulations on the KavAnaugh victory!!!!!
Not for my Daughter, sisters or mother! Today, they learned that they have someone on the Supreme Court that will protect their Constitutional Rights, and not EXPLOIT them the way @SenFeinstein did. Congratulations @BrettKavanaugh @realDonaldTrump
In analogies, the best one for Donald Trump, @realDonaldTrump is that he IS the "American Moses"! The analogy continues, after 10 miracles or so, the promised land is in sight... just look down and see American soil.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for giving us 2 Great #Justices #SupremeCourtBalanceAchieved @godisgood1961 #MAGA #KAG
That performance had @realDonaldTrump written all over it. I'm sure the base ate it up.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for all your efforts in Making America Great Again. Thank you for not caving to the Democrats and their evil deeds. Stay strong and know you have much support.
@realDonaldTrump must visit Colorado. We need his help.
No if it rains it will be @realDonaldTrump fault, but Brexit, it's definitely Jose's fault...
"The @realDonaldTrump would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information. With Trump the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the Donald"

Just heard @realDonaldTrump mention you in Topeka. You and @KrisKobach1787 are going to make Kansas great again!
@DarkToLight17 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Interesting https:// youtu.be/Ekhum8ununk
@realDonaldTrump We need to always reference that when we want illegals to be kept from the country, that needs to be done with SENSITIVITY! Do not make the crazies come out and start anything violent. Connecting 2nd amendment with illegals is going too far.
I want to do for Kansas what President @realDonaldTrump has done for America! - @KrisKobach1787 #VoteForKobach
@ChuckGrassley A huge "Thank You" to you and the other Senators who Stood to be Recognized by confirming Justice Kavanaugh. "We, the People" greatly appreciate your efforts. @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats
I expect Lisa Murkowski will be serving her country still, in whatever capacity she chooses, long after @realDonaldTrump has his date with karma.

@realDonaldTrump I have a question for you Mr President when will we see something change about the Nationwide concealed permit ?
Psalm 37 Holy Bible Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
