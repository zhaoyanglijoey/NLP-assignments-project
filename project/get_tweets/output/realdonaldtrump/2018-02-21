@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @wolfblitzer @AC360 @donlemon TRUMP BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY NRA, $30.6 million from NRA! Trump illiterate too!
What @realDonaldTrump needs to do is deport EVERYBODY. Then America can truly start to be great again. #maga #americawasntmadebyimmigrants
No. Arming teachers is a non-starter, @realDonaldTrump . We want solutions, not scams that funnel public education money to gun manufacturers.
@realDonaldTrump so if arming teachers is the solution to a school shooting, doesn't that mean that the solution to a school fire is for teachers to light another fire?
Only a total #trumphole would need to be reminded to hear people. Shallow agenda for a shallow man. #illegitimateDon @realDonaldTrump Trump's note card for Parkland shooting discussion: 'I hear you' @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2ETNT49
Horrible enough to put black children in classrooms with racist teachers, but giving those racists the right to show up armed and threaten those children is high up on the white supremacists wishlist. So of course @realDonaldTrump and @GOP are all for it.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Nicole Hockley from S-Hook was not practical. yes, they have done things BUT there are ppl not going to school, hooked on opiods,gangs etc. They could head toward the school to harm. Secure the schools-more than 1 guard. Retired Mid-age vets-employ them!!
@realdonaldtrump didn't lie this time. He literally did 'hear' them but we know he and the #GOP will wait out this news cycle and nothing will change. Thankfully, things are changing at many state levels & I welcome all those awesome teens to the Democratic party. #VoteBlue
Honestly, @realDonaldTrump is a complete idiot, who in their right mind would think that more guns is the solution. So teachers won't try to protect the children, instead children will try to dodge not only the bullets from the shooter, but bullets from the teachers guns as well.
Who the fuck needs "Cliff's Notes" to convey compassion, empathy, and decency??? Ahhhhh.... yes, @realDonaldTrump does. #CliffNotes #CribSheet #Dotard
The teenagers held their own without notes ... @realDonaldTrump needs to be coached
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I propose armed security at schools perhaps some retired vets or police. Every professional building in NYC has a guard who meets you when you enter. I would give Police the right to stop and frisk also.
And, I can recall several teachers I wouldn't want handling a sharp object!!! @realDonaldTrump negotiates a way with #GOP and #NRA to increase the revenue to offset Congress increasing the age from 18-21. Genius. #GunControlNow #NeverAgainMSD

@realDonaldTrump (cont)... (like we do with everything) on teachers. To achieve better security, provide schools with $ (based on #of kids) to hire extra police who are trained for this role. More important is changing gun laws and taking preventative steps.

@realDonaldTrump do even 1 of these 3 things and we can start to make change. 1. Instill buy back for all firearms 2. Those caught with any firearms after the buy back period jailed for a minimum of 3 years. 3. Ammunition prices are to be raised to $25 per bullet.

@realDonaldTrump Assault weapons don't belong in our homes and NO WEAPONS belong in our schools. The amount of training needed to fire accurately under stress would not leave time in the day for teaching.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I am a gun owner and would like to say that the age for "assault" weapons should be set at 25

@realDonaldTrump I would expect you to feel even more so about our own Country's children who are being gunned down at schools. Proper response would be: Ban AR's. These are weapons of war. No one needs them outside of the military.

@realDonaldTrump It is your obligation and duty to investigate and prosecute those behind the shootings . Florida shooter wanted to be a professional shooter and walked out with students not expecting to die. Who employed him?

@realDonaldTrump Arming teachers is not the answer. More guns lead to more deaths. We already have 300 million guns in this country. We need to address the lax gun safety laws, a weak gun registration system, need for research, and mushrooming sales of military assault weapons.

What? You want to arm our teachers with guns? Are they going to be Rambo Teacher with an assault rifle or a gun that shoots off a few rounds? Don't forget that the killer is armed with an assault rifle that shoots off 30+ rounds or 100 rounds. What's the point? @realDonaldTrump
It's shameful that @realDonaldTrump pushed #nralies that arming teachers would stop other attacks. He's so full of shit. Teachers would have their hands full just keeping students safe. There is ZERO proof that would have stopped this or any attack. And probably more people die.

@realDonaldTrump Mr. Donald Trump You are a good-hearted and affectionate man. Thank you for hosting the students, parents and teachers of Florida School on your chest welcomed and listen to the students.
A voice of "moderation" he would not be. A force to push the anti-American progressive, communist agenda he would be. He needs defeated. @realDonaldTrump fails us in his indorsement of @MittRomney as he fails is in not pursuing the prosecution of @HillaryClinton @cspanwj
@realDonaldTrump I give you tremendous credit for taking the time to sit down with people of all different views to hear their feelings on School Safety!!!! Now please #ProtectOurChildren
Actually Bill Gates is one of the most generous billionaires there is. His wife Melinda and him donate millions. Try and find any donations in the millions that @realDonaldTrump actually donated to. Not promised and didn't follow through....but actually gave!!!!
