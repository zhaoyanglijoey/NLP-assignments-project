Dear @realDonaldTrump , I love your cosplay pic.twitter.com/SRHKTgsVjo
If anything US gave Erdogan the benefit of doubt way too many times, so much so that TR now assumes renagging on your promises is ok (no cost) and the US need not be taken seriously. Hence @VP and @realDonaldTrump may be the 1st admin to get Turkey right finally.
More of the @realDonaldTrump administration getting shit they didn't earn nor deserve. All we watch them do is take, take, take.

Anyone else notice that the people who have recorded @realDonaldTrump conversations are people who have worked with him for years? It seems like more of a habit from long time associates than a political motive. Like he's always lied and people they are protecting themselves
@hardball CM @OMAROSA isnt telling or yelling anything abt @realDonaldTrump use of #Nword black folk don't already know OM can't even write a so-called tell all abt #racist #POTUS nothing makes her acceptable to #AmericanBlacks after all her inflammatory support of DT vids
@realDonaldTrump would say anything to make a buck. Why he attracts the likes of Amorosa. You should instead ask Trump why he hired her, because she buttered up to him?!
Chain migration. One family member gets a shady green card, others follow. So how are those in-lead Donnie? Get to practice your Russian language pre-K skills? @realDonaldTrump #liat #collusion #MuellerTime #pissoff
@LouDobbs your candidate for Rep. Senate from Wisconsin was not really straight forward re. Supporting President Trump. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #maga
Let's blow twitter the fuck up with this! I want to log in and see it trending! Tweet it out far and wide folks... @realDonaldTrump @POTUS is #FancyDonnieTheCoward
@realDonaldTrump Omarosa is a low life traitor to President Trump! She needs to be prosecuted!
@realDonaldTrump hates the media and says that they are the Enemy of the People. The media provide a great service by explaining real news to the American people. Trump purposely causes great division & distrust. He can also cause war! He is very dangerous & sick! @cnn @nytimes
Trump should look at the world from the bottom up. He only knows the rich at the top not the poor at the bottom @realDonaldTrump @andylassner @krassenstein @EdKrassen @_cbackus @MiraSorvino
@realDonaldTrump is a total disgrace.

Why so much hate for @realDonaldTrump ?why no one had recored Hillary or Obama ? This all done by press #fakenews and Dems,He should #LockThemAllUp
@realDonaldTrump so in other words donnie boy, she was great as long as she was lying about how great you were, but now she is telling the truth she is a lowlife. some judge of character you are, you POS>
So John Kelly fired Omarosa for lack of integrity (sorry I haven't heard the tape)? That's ridiculously hypocritical even for @realDonaldTrump 's @WhiteHouse .

When will @LindseyGrahamSC reveal his email exchanges that include naked pics of young men? The Truth Will Set You Free (from @realDonaldTrump )
@realDonaldTrump and @VP are both pieces of crap who don't deserve to clean McCain's shoes.
@realDonaldTrump is the dumbest man on the planet!!
How Pathetic...look at TRUMPS face.....about as turned on as when he PUSSY Grabs WOMEN! @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
Hard to believe but @realDonaldTrump is by far the most credible. I know he is lying to improve his position when he is talking.

@marthamaccallum @TheRickWilson Another idiot selling a book. Oh .. a political strategist. Guess we should sit up straight. Cover the Pillsbury Book on China strategy please. @marklevinshow was excellent. @SteveHiltonx is great. @realDonaldTrump
Can we ask @realDonaldTrump to raise his hand if he's wiling to help pay down the deficit by resigning? I'm just curious.
Here's another quote from @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/MTozINPBBT

@realDonaldTrump Trump has having a full on reality t.v. show with Omerosa. This is how far down the president and presidency has fallen. A two bit grifter and liar has ruined the country
What @realDonaldTrump has done with our economy in the time he has been in office, says volumes about the Dems Agenda. Given a chance Hillary would have made the entire US into the equivalent of a Dem run city. This isn't a difference of political opinion. It's Anti-American. pic.twitter.com/xRSZVcqbO5

@LouDobbs talks to Kevin Nicholson, Republican candidate for Congressman from #WI . All that you probably need to know is that retiring @SpeakerRyan backs his opponent in Republican Primary. @realDonaldTrump
Those words define the @realDonaldTrump presidency and the the party of @POTUS
TRUMP WON ....and WILL WIN AGAIN IN 2018-2020 ....BOT THAT ! @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @seanhannity @Liz_Wheeler @SarahPalinUSA
Hey @PreetBharara I have had my head down all day. Can you catch me up on what abominations the @realDonaldTrump administration has been up to....never mind
Yes. The media has always sided with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @FBI @SecretService Omarosa must be arrested and prosecuted for Recording in the West Wing and Releasing it to the Public! No Black Privilege! Treat her equally, arrest, prosecute for violations!
FIRING SMIRKING STZROK IS NOT ENOUGH! WE NEED A SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL TO LOOK AT ALL THE CORRUPTION AND THOSE CORRUPT NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE AND JAILED.

lmfao!!of course she was.... #bookoflies @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020
@realDonaldTrump RESIGN NOW.
Congrats on the shout out by @realDonaldTrump . I emailed your campaign twice with an idea. Haven't heard back yet.
@realDonaldTrump You couldn't say 1 nice thing about Mr. McCain today? Really? #asshole
@realDonaldTrump is a disgrace.
@marthamaccallum totally took that gentleman to the woodshed!! They can't argue with the difference @realDonaldTrump is making in this country. They just hate his style! Get over it, #NeverTrumpers ... he's not going anywhere!! #Trump2020Landslide
President @realDonaldTrump : maybe you forgot but you're the President. Hillary is a private citizen and past investigations have found nothing substantial (certainly not criminal). You should focus on your interview as part of the #TrumpRussia investigation.
If the progressive democrat socialists protesting @realDonaldTrump could not use the F bomb they would be mute. #AntifaTerrorists
We are on the same page, I just put an article up too. @JackPosobiec should do some research before he tries to mock @realDonaldTrump for telling the truth. This has been going on for years.
@realDonaldTrump Hell doesn't even want you Trump!!
You are a PETTY LITTLE person @realDonaldTrump . Signing the John S. McCain Defense Authorization Act but deleting Sen. McCain's name and not even mentioning @SenJohnMcCain or his contributions to this country. SAD. #BEBEST
"martial law: the law administered by military forces that is invoked by a government in an emergency when the civilian law enforcement agencies are unable to maintain public order and safety" @realDonaldTrump Please stop the killing of dozens of innocent citizens.
We need an endorsement of @paxilbob Mr President @realDonaldTrump
& He was a HUGE supporter of @realDonaldTrump using his position in the FBI to exonerate Trump at every turn. This year Democrats vote in December to not overload the voting machines & to ensure that enough dead people get to vote to push their imagined blue wave over the line
.@I was wondering will the Public be able to attend the trial or tribunal of Obama and his hundreds of conspirators after all they tried to overthrow a duly elected president of the united states Seth Meyers comes to mind running as a Joke still think that Seth @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Are you ok?
Le crecen los enanos al circo de @realDonaldTrump
Ever notice how pathetic @realDonaldTrump begs for thank yous on Twitter for breathing while rudely failing to acknowledge or thank a real American hero like @SenJohnMcCain
. @realDonaldTrump has declared bankruptcy six times indicating he is incapable of running a simple real estate business that others manage with ease, yet some still believe he is capable of running what was the most powerful country on earth. A total disconnect from reality.
