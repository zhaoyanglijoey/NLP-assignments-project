Bird, Crowley seems like an intelligent and a straight forward kind of person. He does not need me to tell him how to act. I only know Crowley from his twitter responses, but I know he likes to restore old cars. That's cool in my book. @realDonaldTrump for #HappyMemorialDay ... pic.twitter.com/6HtHeiWzBT
#Trump is #America ! #MAGA #WeThePeople adore and almost worship that man! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Actually no it's not. It is so important for me to know those who died, and those who were left behind to continue on... we didn't sacrifice so much for nothing. I actually am beginning to have HOPE in humanity again thanks to President @realDonaldTrump .

I thought this must be a sick joke. How dare you use the fallen to sell your made in China tacky Trump trash? How dare that POS @realDonaldTrump profit from the war dead when he himself dodged the draft through cowardice. Disgusting and shameful.
@realDonaldTrump - as a veteran, I can clearly state that Memorial Day is not about you.
@realDonaldTrump . perfect! pic.twitter.com/NdCQct6NzJ
Icouldt agree with you more @KristenGBaldwin we all know @realDonaldTrump lacks the class, grace, intelligence and charisma @BarackObama has. And let's not forget the hands, Obama has way bigger hands than DT. #ugh
Memorial Day Is About Me, And All My Accomplishments, And Not Only My Accomplishments, Even My, Yes Me, My Exaggerated Accomplishments, So This Memorial Day Think About Me. (See How Fucking Narcissist And Stupid That Sounds @realDonaldTrump You Piece Of Shit)

Hey @realDonaldTrump @POTUS what's it like knowing you have to follow the constitutional right for citizens to petition their government?

Stop exposing yourselves.. Hint: It only unites us even more. #WWG1WGA . @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/NNN7OzJQzg
You sound jelly because @realDonaldTrump keeps #WINNING
Should this be a big surprise that @realDonaldTrump has begun to #CopyCat Russia? Seems like his playbook is filled with #UnAmerican behavior like blaming the Dems for a law he passed in the first place, that was a #NaziParty specialty! Hold fast America, #HoldFast

WHY would President @realDonaldTrump endorse a RINO? Do you know something our president doesn't know?
@realDonaldTrump God knows next to nothing positive has happened since Obama's Presidency ended. But if nothing else, I'm thinking Americans are realizing how important it is to NOT take our right to vote for granted. I hope November Voters turn out in record numbers never be4!!
@realDonaldTrump ......History will record you as the first president in America to incite a cival war among its people. You will rest in the ever after with blood dripping from your fingertips. You are a JOKE!

Happy Memorial day. How about we raise the salaries, bonuses, and benefits of our brave men and women in honor of them @realDonaldTrump ?
Although it is a somewhat self-inflicted, there can be no crueler punishment than having to live with @realDonaldTrump . I feel so sorry for QE2 who apparently has to meet with him when he visits England. Shame on Theresa May if she insisted on it!
I Salute my fellow VETERANS, and SERVICEMEN, on this Memorial Day! And I know that we have a PRESIDENT in the WH now, that cares for the MILITARY and their families. Thank you for your Service! And you R due "RESPECT" at all times! Thank U 4your caring @realDonaldTrump ! pic.twitter.com/xsKDhAfigG

I love all veterans and anyone that fights for my freedom. I love it more that those freedoms allow me to say fuck @realDonaldTrump and fuck our corrupt politicians that continue to sell out American citizens for a paycheck. #HappyMemorialDay and God bless the US Military!
@realDonaldTrump you are one sick and disgusting person. Memorial Day is not about you. It is not about politics. You will go down in history as the worst president America has had. Perhaps that will make you happy that you are the best of the worst.
Hey @realDonaldTrump well you don done it now
@realDonaldTrump @VoteMarsha @chuckfleischman @DianeBlackTN Illegal Aliens have drivers licenses. If they can't earn one - they WILL have one made. WHY IS THERE ONLINE REGISTRATION TO VOTE IN TENNESSEE?!? w/o birth certificate or naturalization papers?!? http:// govotetn.com /
@realDonaldTrump , did you have a problem with Tim Tebow kneeling to pray on company time?
There's a reason why @realDonaldTrump loves her so much that he wants to fuck her, she's just like him.
@realDonaldTrump Such a trashy human being. #ImpeachTrump
