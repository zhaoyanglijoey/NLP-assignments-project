@realDonaldTrump trump is like a dog with a bone - he just won't like it go. I don't care - do you. It only makes him look bad.
Obama or Trump. Doesn't matter. Spending that kind of money when @realDonaldTrump can't even afford to give federal workers a raise, is irresponsible.
@realDonaldTrump
He could be president, like @realDonaldTrump

If I were a train conductor, and someone copied and tweeted my train as their own, I wouldn't even care. Why worry about it? I got a message regarding things like this the other day. It didn't take a lefty 5 minutes to call out the division and talk trash about @realDonaldTrump

Have you spoken to @realDonaldTrump about this?
@realDonaldTrump Vote Trump Republican. Here's the Democrat-Nazi party platform: More taxes more job-killing regulations dumb trade deals. Open borders more crimes terrorists murders; welfare migrants fr backward rape-terrorist scam cultures. Millions of ILLEGAL ALIENS. Voter ID!
@realDonaldTrump plead insanity the only thing that makes sence. Your Mother being interviewed-about you as a child -thought it was smart of you to have glued together your elder brothers loaned blocks, I am sure you can't imagaine how he felt either , poor unrespected soul
OR they were withheld because they were being used investigatipvely and once complete, released. President @realDonaldTrump has everything. The deep state could not exert that much control as to hold back these texts because they no longer hold that much power.

Forget arguing the damn total! That won't bring those poor people back, Focus on what @realDonaldTrump DIDN'T do to help Puerto Rico. Goddammit,he loves to stir outrageous shit up to distract from reality. Pin his ass to the wall!
When will he be imprisoned @realDonaldTrump ?
@realDonaldTrump when you go to NC, don't forget the paper towels and bottled water. Leave the water on tarmac for year and then when it is declared contaminated say it was mayor of San Juan's fault .. or Manafort Gates Flynn Papadapalous.

@realDonaldTrump Gosh ...funny how so many Republican trump supporters are turning out to be criminals and thugs. Looks like your boy Paul Manafort is gonna cooperate with Mueller... There is a ROT inside your criminal party and you're the most rotten of all.
Wh... Where... Where is @realDonaldTrump on Twitter today? I (don't) miss his incoherent ramblings. Oh wait, that's right... Manafort. Have a great weekend, everyone else!

If the new information that's been reporter, that Manafort's cooperation agreement doesn't involve anything to do with the @realDonaldTrump campaign is true, do you think Mueller is finally going after the Podestas?

The #GOP think that @realDonaldTrump follow him like he's the second coming because of the economy. Any idiot knows when u loosen restrictions the market always goes up!
@RubenNavarretteJr is a real journalist. WaPo columnist who isn't afraid of the truth. He called out The Left on their hypocritical arguments against @realDonaldTrump during @chadbensonshow , just now. Finally, a MSM "journalist" in a sea of posers.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you so much President Trump for all you have done to help the people of North and South Carolina during this terrible hurricane! I pray for you and your family. God bless you sir...
