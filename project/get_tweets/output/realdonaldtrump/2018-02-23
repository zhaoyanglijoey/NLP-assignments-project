@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President, If we keep a jar of pencils on our desks, the pencils are gone by the end of the day. But you think it's a good idea to keep a GUN there? Sincerely, Every Teacher Ever
@realDonaldTrump kicked it today @CPAC . Those kids love our #POTUS , ADMIN, FAMILY and so do we. Awesome speech, motivating. Thank you Mr. President #MAGA #MASA #GodBlessAmerica #AmericaFirst #SayingItLikeITIs
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump lock him up!
Make America great again. @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/cStMf3IPrP
Trump: Officer in Parkland didn't 'love the children' @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2BMyBMu He froze, which was a natural response. I'm sure that @realDonaldTrump would have run like Hell, in the OTHER direction! Wanker!
.You are an idiot, @realDonaldTrump . We are not all so stupid as to believe your distortions of reality. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump @CPAC #Trumphair trying to hide his bald spot like his #Adultery #RussiaCollusion #MoneyLaundering #Lies #TrumpCrimeFamily
"progressive" leftists are the single most destructive force in the history of the USA. Ignorant too. They call President @realDonaldTrump Hitler, then demand the government take away guns.

@realDonaldTrump has built nothing but a house of lies and a huge resistance
@realDonaldTrump Heard today in the latest twist of Russian-Trump collusion there is an Unnamed Member of Congress involved. We the people want to know who this is. Can you find out and let Americans know? We want the truth!
@realDonaldTrump Did anyone ask Deputy Peterson if he had bone spurs? Maybe that led to his lack of heroism. #Parkland
Wow! @realDonaldTrump #IllegitimatePresident
Disappointed at the way #OGWT ended and the whole #TextForYourFavourite nonsense - shame that you just didn't show them all! @WhisperingBob @BBCFOUR #FirstPastThePost #Bollox At the risk of sounding like the pr*ck that is @realDonaldTrump #SoSad
@realDonaldTrump another bad day! So much losing! How is that approval rating?
@realDonaldTrump says of deputy sheriff : "when it came time for him to get in there to do something, he didn't have the courage" Is that called: "The Bone Spur Effect"? #bluewave is coming for #GOP @jim_jordan @senrobportman
Funny that many teachers in Texas who do carry say #ArmMeWith a gun. I would say they are confident in their gun defense skills. It's not for everyone! #MAGA @CNN @NYTIMES #BREAKING #cnn @POTUS @ap #cnnbrk @msnbc @realDonaldTrump @PressSec #Hannity #Tucker
@realDonaldTrump alone as an entity is irresponsible. What else can we expect?
Also @oprah gave us @barackobama which then gave us @realdonaldtrump As #SusanPowter says #StopTheInsanity
@realDonaldTrump NO to more Democrats in any position of power. The Democrat party is moving to one of Socialism, big Government & Welfare. NO to ILLEGALS & the corrupt Democrat party. Trump 2020. MAGA.
@realDonaldTrump As a voter I would like no nix fix, firearms related bans or age requirement increases. My vote and the votes of many others will be determined by Your actions. Allowing school staff to be armed is a great way to curb school shootings. Mass shooters are cowards.
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan , @cnn , @nra Who'll be first to file a discrimination lawsuit. I will on a contingency basis. I need a high power attorney. This needs to be shared nationwide.

@realDonaldTrump on many occasions has disparaged and mocked #vets , their familes, #FBI , #CIA , #military members, #American #intelligence , and so on. #NRA now mocks the #FBI and the men and women that #protect and #serve
Yeah..exactly... @realDonaldTrump is well informed.../facepalm
Everyday we lose multiple WWII vets! What is @realDonaldTrump doing to stop this!

assault on our 1st Amendment. Progressives will destroy this nation, the Constitution, & the laws of the land, as proven by sanctuary cities & attacks on the Bill of Rights. They have no respect for tradition, the truth, or their fellow American citizens. @realDonaldTrump
To all who offered support & prayers regarding my experience, I truly thank you. I would never have made it public were it not for those who are so anxious to destroy our 2nd Amendment. While I'm at it, I'll offer this; political correctness is a major... @realDonaldTrump
Why should he be victimized for campaigning for @realDonaldTrump ? Liberals are good at criminalizing the opposition. We all know there was no Trump Russia collusion
Not if your going to put @realDonaldTrump on it, give him a yoyo, that will keep his tiny mind and hands busy for years
From our #ExtremeIronyDepartment : @realDonaldTrump , who's been regurgitating #NRATalkingPoints since #ParklandShooting , hosts #AustralianPM . Perhaps some pointers for #Trump , on how #Aus gr8ly reduced #MassShootings by limiting gun ownership, are in order. #SensibleGunControl
@realDonaldTrump Jimmy Carter's idea of a 2 state solution with Jerusalem as capital for both is a great idea
Apparently @Potus really wants a military parade. http:// nyp.st/2EZaxIm How about we bring US troops home from somewhere first. Syria? Iraq? Afghanistan? Please, @realDonaldTrump , end one of America's unnecessary wars first!
@DavidMuir saw your segment on new charges from Mueller. You neglected to say charges were from 2013 activity. You mislead America to think they are current and aligned with Trump. They are NOT. Pathetic reporting. No wonder MSM is rated so LOW @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @abcnews
@realDonaldTrump know what a coward is, he see one every time he looks in the mirror #floridahighschoolshooting
Wow, @realdonaldtrump , is this really the world you want as your legacy? #SickMind #TrumpMinionRuleChanges #LackingAnyHumanity #Farce Stop Pigs Being Scalded Alive! http:// bit.ly/2sQZb4o
@realDonaldTrump can't negotiate his hair on a windy day. Most inept president in history ain't gonna do shit until the NRA tells him to.

we have carling that tastes like @realDonaldTrump has pissed in your mouth
@realDonaldTrump what you need to is level with the mother fuckers so the two parties quit undercutting eachother.
The next POTUS will have one job. UNDO EVERYTHING @realDonaldTrump DID ON DAY ONE. ALL OF IT. ERASE HIM COMPLETELY. #realDonaldTrump #impeach #NotMyPresident
Yes you know @realDonaldTrump is going to have a twitter tantrum

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @nikkihaley Hey guys, when your own "spooks" tell you Israel IS NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND, why do you keep brown-nosing them??
Every person that @realDonaldTrump comes into contact with becomes even more unethical and engages in dishonest activities out of narcissistic self interest.
If you STILL support @realDonaldTrump after all this then #IDontKnowYouMan pic.twitter.com/LyjDo7k0Cg
My heart breaks for families affected by gun violence & the inaction & empty words of elected officials sickens me. The @CPAC comments by @realDonaldTrump today were disrespectful, disgusting. #neveragainmovement we will #VoteThemOut .
No different than @realDonaldTrump though.
@realDonaldTrump forget raising the minimum age...TAKE THEM OFF THE SHELVES!
We stand with you! @realDonaldTrump
@EricTrump is the son of @realDonaldTrump , the most ill-mannered, uneducated president this nation has ever suffered through.

@realDonaldTrump doesn't care how many Americans there are left after he has pillaged and polluted the country
@realDonaldTrump ARM ME WITH AIR CONDITIONING IN MY CLASSROOM! Try teaching on the 2nd floor of a brick building built in 1905 in NJ in JUNE!
@FIRE_THE_FOOL all the "Empathy" the Fake President @realDonaldTrump poured out the other day was tossed out the window as soon as he opened his mouth during CPAC speech. Promised guns for more money to @GOP . #VoteThemOut2018 #TrumpRussiaNRA #TrumpLies #GunControlNow

@realDonaldTrump Trump states teachers will do a better job having a gun than police will cause the teacher cares more about the kids. Does that mean our local police don't care about their communities. This is an insult to our police, they defend us everyday
. @realDonaldTrump wants to arm 1/5 teachers but dont have a budget for basic supplies for 4/5 of those teachers
Hey Scrotus, @realDonaldTrump spends some time this weekend having Baron teach you proper grammar, will ya!
@realDonaldTrump
The dotard @realDonaldTrump is probably getting a kickback for the increase in gun sales.
@realDonaldTrump "no collusion"
@realDonaldTrump signs documents with those kids pens used in preschool - they're extra big with a flat side so they don't roll off the desk
@realDonaldTrump and because of your grandfather you were born in the United States and you are an American.. So why you hated them...
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS PLEASE pull ICE out of California & all Sanctuary city's & States!! Let them reap what they so!!
@realDonaldTrump And yet, Ttump STILL refuses to impose the sanctions demanded by Congress because of the attack by Russia on our election-while Trump says that he believes Putin-Hey, he says Putin is a great guy! #TheResistance #FoxNews #MarchForOurLives #BanAssaultWeapons
@realDonaldTrump This is not an issue of age, guns, NRA, or military service. It is a failure of GOVERNMENT. A 2013 amendment to NICS Act failed (before the last presidential election) that would have closed gaps in the system, 48-52. Guess who voted against it. DEMOCRATS.
What I saw was @realDonaldTrump spinning like a drunk, dancing on a bar at a frat party under the misguided belief that people were laughing with him, not at him. #CleanCoal with applause or were they booing #BlackLungKills ? I know he doesn't read, but he gets news brief, right?

What about the thousands of dreamers who grew up here and who share our values? @realDonaldTrump cut them off and is now holding their status hostage so he can get an expensive wall we do not need and limit immigration to pretty much whites only.
The Molester-in-chief, cadet Bone Spurs, who was so chickenshit that he dodged the draft numerous times, called the Parkland deputy a coward. Agent Orange is a scumbag. @realDonaldTrump #impeachtrump

@realDonaldTrump is a meanspirited, bullying, lying Basta*d!!! How dare he take another swipe at @SenJohnMcCain who is an unbelievable Man who cares more about Our Country than #Trump EVER WILL! @realDonaldTrump is HEARTLESS, SHAMEFUL and a complete EMBARRASSMENT to the USA!!!
