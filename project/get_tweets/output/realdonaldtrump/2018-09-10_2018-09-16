@chelseahandler you need to get on the @JoyVBehar train with @Alyssa_Milano and start kissing @realDonaldTrump ass.
I lived through hurricane relief. No matter how well executed any FEMA plan might be ; it is painful slow and tedious. Once the victims realize @realDonaldTrump is lying and help is not on the way; they will join the blue wave. Trump will screw this up bad #HurricaneFlorence2018

@realDonaldTrump seeing that @Twitter has no issues with blocking free speech from conservatives then there should be no issues with you blocking whomever you want to block on your personal account. I do not see any Liberal judges telling @Twitter they can't do that.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President Twitter now allows Tweets calling for the killing of "Whites"+"Trump Supporters"(NONE resulted in the Tweeters being suspended or banned), while Twitter still very aggressively bans Conservatives+Republicans before the November elections!

@realDonaldTrump The only wealth being experienced by your debacle of a Presidency is going to you and your wealthy cronies! Get real, you and they do not reflect real America or Americans in any way, shape, or form! pic.twitter.com/AoMN3oy7zO
That is exactly what @realDonaldTrump . Said about Obama
I call B.S. Mr President... Thank you @BarackObama for giving @realDonaldTrump a thriving economy... @POTUS fails to understand the consequences of his ill-advised #TradeWars All the gains made by @POTUS44 will be lost!!! Massive layoffs are coming.... #TellTheTruth

. @realDonaldTrump - Hi Donnie, what size...? If you happen to know the sizes for #MoronJr . , . @IvankaTrump and . @JaredKusher it would speed things up a bit. #TrumpCrimeFamily pic.twitter.com/FyfLHPg6oU
@realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @RealCandaceO These Allegations against Hon Kavanaugh really smell. The way they were held off, presented, and timing. What's next? The Race Card? This is a new low for the Dems. J Flake too! Kavanaugh is WELL Qualified! #MAGA #LIE #DemareRATS !

Tell you what, I have offered this to multiple liberals, and EVERY single time they refuse, because they know, like you know, they will lose. I will wager $100 cash, that @realDonaldTrump is not found guilty of #RussiaCollusion . Care to bet?

@realDonaldTrump The fact that the GOPOCRISY can point to one or two statements by President Obama over 10 years, but are silent about Comrade Dim Donnie and his MULTIPLE LIES EVERY SINGLE DAY proves their utter immorality. #FuckTrump
Rep. T Cole (R-OK) is delusional saying @realDonaldTrump is not having an adverse effect on GOP.
#WalkAwayFromDemocrats #KavanaughForSCOTUS @realDonaldTrump Trump/Pence @maga2020
oddly enough, that's kind of exactly what @realDonaldTrump did to @BarackObama policies & now #BarrySoetoro wants to take credit for all the success. @askjimmycarter should've stayed quiet since he "at least" tied for #WorstPresidentEver with #Obama

@BenSasse Like a true enabler of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump , blame everyone else except the ones responsible. Take a look in the mirror, Ben.
@realDonaldTrump What about the 3000 you starved to death in Puerto Rico. Im so happy 770k are going to vote against your corrupt gop. Graham's going down with you.

Donalds view on Mexicans @realDonaldTrump
Joe Biden the ex-Vice President of the USA Just refered to the GOP patriots who voted for and support @realDonaldTrump Dregs of Society for those that don't know what "DREGS" means "the dregs of society" synonyms: scum, refuse, riffraff, outcasts, deadbeats;
@SenateDems @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump Just remember that the number of Puerto Ricans moving to Florida over the last few weeks - and the number that could move in the coming months - could tip the purple state in future elections.
His lawyers have him tied up with a ball gag and he's loving every minute LMFAO @realDonaldTrump
