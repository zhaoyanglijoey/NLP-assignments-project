Democrats claim @realDonaldTrump is an idiot then they claim he's so smart that he has hidden his Russian ties that's why Mueller their criminal leader (HSBC) has found nothing #Resist is a joke and in Nov they will find out what fools they are
On this Super Bowl Sunday, I just want to remind everyone: you know which (supposed) billionaire doesn't own an NFL team? That's right! @realDonaldTrump doesn't own an NFL team. He tried, but couldn't.

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President with all do respect I understand the wall on the Mexican Border but what about other issues going on in the United States. To me Child Protective Service can be shut down you can save a lot money by stop funding them that would actually help also.
Not even close to being as racist or sexist as @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump time to clean house at DOJ and nominate Trey Gowdy to run the DOJ as AG.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, you have to watch "What the Health" directed by Kip Anderson. It's terrible what's being sold to Americans. It's on Netflix.
the huge question on republicans minds are..when is trump going 2 be acknowledged for what all he has done & is planning to do?Donald Trump was very likeable he becomes president & then people come out of the wood work & claim 2 hate him I don't get it? thank u @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump has never taken the first step to stop or stand in the way of the investigation. That entire narrative comes from the left trying to taunt him into doing something they can pounce for. He'll let it play out, just so he can have the last laugh.
@MSNBC ||| LISTEN. @REALDONALDTRUMP IS IGNORANT ABT "FLAG & STANDING & NATL ANTHEM." READ THE LAW(S) THAT @SCOTUS ALLOWED #JEHOVAHSWITNESSES TO THEIR CHOICE (STAND, SALUTE, OR NOT). TRUMP CAN NEITHER "MAKE LAWS NOR ENFORCE NON-LAWS!" NO EXCUSE! HE NEEDS TO STOP!!!! -me RT #FOOL
@realDonaldTrump Wish you were our President in Australia. Keep up the Outstanding work and the pressure on the Evil Axis within your ranks. Don't forget Rockefeller and Rothschild, And don't forget to stop the ChemTrails, ...we all know whats up there for goodness sake .
@realDonaldTrump will continue to lie knowing we all see his deflection but in the wake of the ridiculous memo and Don Jr.s admission McGabe was fired this is all beginning to be a bad Russian Movie. This is an Embarrassment to the USA and the fact that there is no Leaders @GOP
It wasn't Steele. It was the Russians. Putin doesn't like @HillaryClinton , they knew Steele was shopping for dirt on @realDonaldTrump for her. He figures it's a win/win. @FBI made it a massive win for Putin by using it. The entire world is watching this joke on us unfold.

@realDonaldTrump I confess, I watched 3 minutes of it once. I judged, and correctly, that it was the most unadulterated self-aggrandizing show in the entire cable lineup. It was about Trumpo for Trumpo. There were no other stars, characters, or stories.
