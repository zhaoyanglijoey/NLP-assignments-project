@realDonaldTrump don't you think the press would like to not have to report all this crap? They have a job to do and sadly for all of us it is to report on you. If you would stop being a jerk they could stop reporting that you're a jerk! Problem solved. Don't be a jerk!
This is the America that @realDonaldTrump has given us. And you support him.
Of what relevance is this news to u? @POTUS has a lot to sort out. So many will take care of that. You report all the negative of @realDonaldTrump . This is unfair. Loopsided news. You must change now.
RT @DiamondandSilk : RECORDED: Whorehouse @realdonaldtrump honey-pot in Charlotte, NC
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump : Haven't u done enough damage - separating families, kidnapping children, deporting parents w/o their children. "So happy?" Will you be eliminating more detention facilities by shooting asylum seekers on sight?
You fuck face jack ass. This is what we get when you suck up 2 @realDonaldTrump the incendiary time bomb @SenateDems @SarahKSilverman @DearAuntCrabby @marwablue @MotherJones @RollingStone @SenJeffMerkley @SenKamalaHarris @DearAuntCrabby @SenGillibrand @joncoopertweets @funder
It would have been nice if @realDonaldTrump had done so & cancelled the rally. But of course he couldn't cancel a chance to incite more hate could he? #VoteBlue #EnoughIsEnough #GunControlNow #NoMore #TrumpIncitesViolenceEveryDay
@wolfblitzer way to throw @realDonaldTrump 's name into this PA shooting. You can't get through one segment without trying to drag him through the dirt or associate him with tragedy. You are a huge POS.

So, by the new standard, if you've ever once used the #QAnon hash, you then fully support the movement. I think we should all thank and welcome the millions of new #Q followers personally on every single one of their tweets! #WWG1WGA #QAnon #GreatAwakening . @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump 's legacy will be #WhiteTerror
Hey @realDonaldTrump take some lessons from @BetoORourke on how to connect with the American ppl! Voted for Beto !
@FoxNews try reporting that today marks the 294th shooting of 2018 under @realDonaldTrump administration. What a failure! NOT law and order. Try hatred and killing. Murica!! #VoteBlue Repeal and replace GOP.
@realDonaldTrump has kept his campaign promises to his voters but a few important bills did not pass by a couple of votes re/ Healthcare, Immigration, the wall. We need more Republican Senators & Congressman serving so we can get these bills passed. PLS VOTE FOR THE GOP CANDIDATE

@realDonaldTrump during Trump's run for the Presidency everyone considered him an outsider, then Trump became Potus, but I think crooked CNN the media the Democrats the establishment consider him still an outsider. #JellyBellyFriday
So we should put armed guards in every house of worship, every restaurant, every grocery store, every movie theater, every gas station. Everywhere? Does this #MAGA @realDonaldTrump ?
How dare @realDonaldTrump suggest we arm synagogues... and not to set a standard of moral behavior, get rid of guns, and to make a stand against anti Semitic and racist prople in his administrative swamp and in his base . He is just disgusting #UnfitForOffice
Do you all remember when @RonDeSantisFL and @realDonaldTrump were in heated words? Well I sure do. DeSantis realized that Trump was doing great for our country and decided to join the @The_Trump_Train This train is growing everyday.
@realDonaldTrump THAT SEALS THE DEAL! THEY ARE INVADERS AND MUST BE STOPPED BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! YOU HAVE THE MANDATE WE ELECTED YOU FOR TO STOP! DO WHAT EVER IT TAKES TO DENY THEM ENTRY!
Very sad indeed Sarah. Just like the bigotry and hate that we all see aimed towards you and our great President here on this post each and every day. You should all be ashamed of yourself. This is typical leftists bullying. Stay strong Sarah. We you. @realDonaldTrump
No, let's not. We can't continue to do this to ourselves as a society, can we? We're expecting something to happen that won't happen in a million yrs. @realDonaldTrump is a defective human being.When u get a defective product, u send it back.1st step: #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
@morgGstalt @TheDemocrats @TheDemCoalition @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Small miracle today. Now only if the news media and elected officials could address the horrendous GOP corruption via @realDonaldTrump #25thAmendmentNow
I look at the "Hate Does Not Live Here" sign on my lawn & cringe; it does. Every day this rotten, hate-filled jerk is in office, feelings of bitterness, anger & yes, hate, creep into my space. I don't like what @realDonaldTrump has done to me & my country. @DNC , #ImpeachTrumpNow
Let's not attack @realDonaldTrump at this moment. This is the time for funerals and shiva. After that, it'll be time to look at all accounts
@realDonaldTrump Looking over the amount of dollars being given to foreign nations at https://www. foreignassistance.gov . How is the way this money is allocated & spent accounted for? 27.7 bn is a lot of wall.
We want to say this to the people of Germany you are so lucky to have @AngelaMerkeICDU We know some do not like her. Be proud that you do not have @realDonaldTrump . @BILD_English @TheLocalGermany #Germany @RTLde @GermanyDiplo @guardian @AP @washingtonpost @rosemaryCNN @nytimes
@realDonaldTrump @JustinTrudeau & @theresa_may were not invited.The questions were raised about Late Jamal Khashoggi. We again thank @AngelaMerkeICDU response " There will be a joint Reaction once @AdelAljubeir & @KingSalman gives answers" Yemen was also her concern.
. @realDonaldTrump you clearly understand nothing about mass killers, they commit these acts knowing, wanting to be killed in the effort. Threat of the death penalty doesn't deter crime, that's a fact. So to say threat of the death penalty would stop mass shootings is asinine
I'm sure this is the #iPhone that @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS uses to access @Twitter to send out his tweets and talk to people like family, friends and others, that's non-classified/top secret, however I'm sure for official business i.e. classified/top secret matters it is secured.
@realDonaldTrump Armed worshipers!? The root cause mr "president" isn't religion or weapons its #Hate and your unwitting promotion, and yes, weponization of it. Period!
@realDonaldTrump You are a shithead.

#DirtyFilthyLyingMedia This douche works for @thedailybeast and still lies about @POTUS when @realDonaldTrump referred to the people legitimately protesting the elimination of historical statuary - the left was assaulting our checkered history by erasing it-Is he Dumb or Obtuse?
Well except for: @realDonaldTrump Criminal Family Enterprise: @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump CoConspirators: @VP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenRonJohnson @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley @SenatorBurr @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake
Mainly deplorable white conservatives. @realDonaldTrump supporters reminds me of the dark American history when men were lynched and the crowd cheered, drank and party. Despicable!!
@VP @realDonaldTrump refuse to talk about their speeches earlier this week when they talked about the Jewish conspiracy; @netanyahu seeks cheap mileage out of deaths

You can blame @realDonaldTrump for his "Globalist" dog whistling.
I already voted 100% GOP for #MAGA & @realdonaldtrump Our POTUS needs ever single GOP on the ballot
I know @realDonaldTrump could never have empathy, a heart or show compassion, care and love like President @BarackObama but instead of him going to that rally he should've been in Pittsburgh showing some kind of care & love for those who lost loved ones but that's just me.
I never voted for him what makes him think I want his version of democracy? Time to take money like his out of politics. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump - I am tired of having someone in the White House who doesn't care about making our country better. Why are you never outraged? It could have been your family ( if they ever really go to synagogue) This violence towards people who are different has got to stop!
. @realDonaldTrump No mercy for terrorists?? Oh good, then does that mean no mercy for Saudi scum and no mercy for your pals, the Zionists either?? Let's hope so !
and donnie will say he had more people at his me, me, me rally..won't you @realDonaldTrump #Magabomber
@realDonaldTrump NEVER said "Nazis" or Neo Nazis are 'fine people." Part of the Big Lie. In Charlottesville 2 groups protested originally - those who wanted statues to say & those who wanted them to be torn down. Trump said there were "good people on both sides." 2/3
Again, crooked @realDonaldTrump is an evil cloud that has to be dispersed! #TreeOfLifeSynagogue #GunControlNow #ImpeachTrumpNow #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
@realDonaldTrump Immigrant caravan - Would it be a good idea to confront and assist them BEFORE they get to the border. The liberal news media is foaming at the mouth to get their cameras on them right on our border. Is someone trying to get them here before election day?
Whatever, evil will happen with or without @realDonaldTrump .
The right likes to say Obama LIED when saying if you like you plan, you can keep it. MOST people did keep their plan and their doctor. What comes out of Trump's mouth everyday, are outright, provable lies. Today: Wall St. was open the day after 9/11. @realdonaldtRump #maga
@realDonaldTrump
White nationalism is a war against the modern, multicultural, democratic world. Very similar to the motivation of ISIS. And that's @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump I think you're doing a phenomenal job, President Trump, and am praying for the Republican party to have GREAT success in these upcoming Mid-term elections. Hope the democrats get DECIMATED!!! I'm from Toronto, Ontario.
If you really cared, you would do more to stop @realDonaldTrump and his hateful #rhetoric #Hypocrites
It's thanks to the hateful rhetoric and lies which spew from your mouth & racist Pussygrabber ( @realDonaldTrump ) which are DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for this horror & the mailed bombs from the previous week. Perhaps you & your boss should reassess what the fuck you are saying!!!
@GOP @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump when will the Republican Party realize that the NRA is the enemy of the state.?
@realDonaldTrump Pt.5 My response. Once President Trump is apprised of this atrocity, he will take action against these alleged criminals!!!...and these are criminals!!!
Like they did for everything, I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow @realDonaldTrump and @FoxNews ( @IngrahamAngle , @marklevinshow , @TuckerCarlson @rushlimbaugh , @LouDobbs ... say that 11 dead in the mass shooting at Pittsburgh Synagogue was a hoax.
And the world would be a much better place if you were a true leader that cared about all, not just yourself #narcissist @realDonaldTrump . #MAGASynagogueShooter #FreePress
When is @realDonaldTrump going to be put up on criminal charges for inciting violence? There is plenty of evidence of it. #violence #bombthreat #PittsburghSynagogue #CesarSayocJr #Vegas #CapitalGazette #Pulse

I stated facts & you go after my logic? My logic caused an antisemitic shooter to kill Jews in thier house of worship? Or was it @realDonaldTrump ? W/ his hate filled speeches? Designed & constructed to save his own ass because he committed treason? Trump tower, Helsinki = TREASON
@GOP 's Thoughts & Prayers aren't working. Americans Demand #SensibleGunLaws . @realDonaldTrump Americans shouldn't need an Armed Guard to Pray at Church. #WhiteNationalism is an Assault on Humanity. #TrumpRussia #VoteDEMOCRATIC For America.
KEK! Because you talk to anyone outside of the liberal echo chamber. #QAnon @realDonaldTrump
Equally importantly, we need to combat the culture of hate and violence that @realDonaldTrump has perpetuated with every fiber of our being!
@realDonaldTrump hold my beer
@USSupremeCourt @realDonaldTrump Yes Do Take A Two Year Shutdown For Caucus To Change This Into A Central Management Office Knowledgeable Of The Finite Of Workings.. Invite Business And Those From The 11,000 Member Commonwealth..
Yes, and @realDonaldTrump is radicalizing them by his twitter feed with all the hatred and lies he spews!
The message of @realdonaldtrump in his speeches is clear when he says that the nation must reunite he means that the Democrats must reunite with him & that the media must conform to the Fox news to the propaganda of the state is not a message of union but a threat to obey.
Miss his compassion. At best @realdonaldtrump grudgingly reads a teleprompter speech he neither believes nor cares about.
This is something @DonaldJTrumpJr pervert GF would come up with maybe she helped the #magabomber , while @LouDobbs watched and the called @realDonaldTrump to confirm everything is fake news
By hate-monger you mean @realDonaldTrump , right?

In the oval office your friend Kanye mention the bomber days before the bomber @realDonaldTrump why would kanye know about the bomber before it happened you are a liar
@realDonaldTrump is just a walking Facebook post
The same conspiracies @realdonaldtrump and @foxnews spread. They are radicalizing right wing nuts.
The only thing shameful is you. These proud young black Americans are thinking for themselves & turning away from you and your anti @realDonaldTrump rhetoric. Trump was good enough when you needed him or his $ but now you stand in judgement of him. God will judge U in the end.
The more the left hates @realDonaldTrump the more I know he is on track. I judge how much I like something he does by how much hate the left spews.

Hey @realDonaldTrump , this is a real President.
i lived in mexico til 2016 and lost everything being embezzled from. i was lucky to have a bed come election time. food/water was a struggle thats why i didnt vote but i am grateful to be repatriated and feel we are all blessed even the ungrateful libs, to have @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/BrwnLqPsw0
@realDonaldTrump Demoncrats use real bullets to murder innocents! Why do they hate Jews?
Liar. @realDonaldTrump NEVER called "immigrants" animals. He called MS-13 ANIMALS - would you like to speak to the parents of a young girl murdered by MS-13 & call then "divine sparks?" Soros may be Jewish but he's an ENEMY OF ISRAEL. He NEVER said "Nazis" are fine people 1/2
. @realDonaldTrump After the #SynagogueShooting you say antisemitism should be condemned. Mr. President, I condemn you and your supporters for demonizing George Soros, a Jewish Holocaust survivior who has used his wealth to benefit others.

I love how when @realDonaldTrump punks the social media giants on social media regarding censorship, I regain ~50 followers and more people see my posts. #MAGA
@BarackObama Do you ever wonder why you have almost twice the amount of followers as @realDonaldTrump and Twitter now says most of his are fake?
@realDonaldTrump I agree with you- if we cower down and change our lives because we are afraid, we have let the evil ones and the Deep State win
Always a dual message. @realDonaldTrump says one thing as #POTUS n a different thing as a #politician . We say the same thing, each time, this #Trump thing will come to past, sooner than u think.
