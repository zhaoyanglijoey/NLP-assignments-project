Donal J Trump is a RACIST LIAR. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump While you clumsily call other nations shitholes, a once rich neighbor is becoming one. Gonna act for Venezuela? Ur button?
@realDonaldTrump @GOP Previous Presidents have spent MLK day doing public service work. You had your fat ass dropped into one of your shithole golf clubs.
Celebrating today by reflecting on @realDonaldTrump first year. It's the lowest unemployment for African Americans in 45 years! Prison reform is being otw to help minorities get out and find jobs! MLK Jr park has been named a National Park! First ever by an African American!
Now this is how you do it. It's called being a real president that people are proud of... you could never get that many likes on any tweet unless you said you were resigning. @realDonaldTrump #BlueTsunami2018 #FakePresident pic.twitter.com/nvrXMaF2xa
#hatetrump @cnn @realDonaldTrump I don't get it, Trump is holding the dreamers hostage and the democrats are the ones with the money. The president is not supposed to be the bad guy right? He says Dems want drugs and all the bad stuff pouring in? I have only heard them say Daca
Good on @realDonaldTrump to pick a this MLK day to play golf. I love some golf but I gotta tell you it's a white, white sport. I know there's Tiger Woods but he was not the norm in the golfing world. #MLKDay
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @TomiLahren trump and the wife he ordered immigrants and the 5 white guys deciding the DACA outcome are immigrants. If you are not indigenous to this Continent you are an IMMIGRANT tomi lahren ancestors are living on Native homestead land in SD pic.twitter.com/tgpe8pmBHt
. @realDonaldTrump REAL news is always being reported b/c they always get it right! They promote a REAL book about a mentally deranged fake president, which is based off true information & facts. about how I cheated and rigged the election in my favor w/ Putin's & Russia's help!
No way this should be passed without knowledge of what @DevinNunes saw. What patriots will stand with you @tedcruz @TomCottonAR @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @GOP Seriously abuses during last election much bigger threat than Russia. Protect our rights or fail history
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should listen and take notes from President Reagan...
I do not believe @realDonaldTrump ever in intended to create a pathway to citizenship for DACA. He believes that there are only two types of immigrants; criminals and those that work for him. He has sabotaged solutions & forbidden the @GOP to find a solution.
@LavarMemes @ZO2_ @MagicJohnson @Lavarbigballer @BillWalton @Lakers @Soulforsoles @LakersReporter @RealMikeWilbon @realDonaldTrump #Thebestrookie .

Seeing GOP members, specifically @MikePenceVP @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan talk about MLK JR makes me me truly question if they know who the man was and what he did for this country and the world.
And yesss....MY @POTUS this is exactly why millions&millions of us put our hopes&dreams with you...and most importantly our VOTES. Plan to vote for @realDonaldTrump AGAIN!So proud of your policy America 1st!
This means he said it but everyone took it the wrong way! Lol What a piece of you are @realDonaldTrump ! You ARE a racist!
@realDonaldTrump we will let you in to the uk IF you bring @BarackObama with you and let him do all your meetings and public appearances as well basically let him do your job just better than you
As if @realDonaldTrump is capable of apologizing or taking blame for anything.
DAMN RIGHT @realDonaldTrump Dicky Durbin tried to snarl you into a DACA Deal - if you don't they will say you are racist -THEY HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU A RACIST SINCE 2015 - DO NOT GIVE IN
What happened from Hawaii, was CLEARLY another Knee Jerk Effort from BHO / Democrats to Test @realDonaldTrump !The Hawaiian Leaders, are being held hostage and must comply for money flow, or death, as the BHO/HRC are known to have happen, BHO "appointed Judge is a clue to events" pic.twitter.com/KHRBvqqPbX

@sternshow I actually now think that @realDonaldTrump actually works less than @HowardStern ! Didn't think anyone did.
@realDonaldTrump I do not want you to cave on a standalone DACA bill. That's what has happened for YEARS, Congress has had 4 months or longer to find a real solution and they simply refuse. CONGRESS as a whole must compromise and get a REAL bill.
@realDonaldTrump needs to deport them all so fast that MSM liars can't keep up!! Keep deporting them because we all know it is the only chance DEMS have to stay in power since American citizens do NOT support DEMS! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump
I'll bet @realdonaldtrump would hate it if people RT this.
@realDonaldTrump is the biggest sack@of shit we have ever had in the Oval Office.,
Our standing in the world was lowered once @realDonaldTrump won the @GOP nomination. It is not just he and the Government that is being scrutinized, it is the citizens as well. When we travel we will have to wear something that says we are not with Trump. #TheResistance

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, if there is a government shutdown, are you going to barricade the national monuments the way President Obama did?

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trumps words were not unfortunate they were racist. To minimize the vocabulary is the same as endorsing it. He is a racist bigot. It is reprehensible and disgusting. Shame on those that cover for him
@realDonaldTrump @TomCottonAR @senator this is what a real tweet reads like...Tom Cotton you and your complicit counterparts in that meeting will have your day. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

Commercial: "Are you @realdonaldtrump & don't want to sound racist? Have we got help for you! Try our revolutionary new product! With 'Shut The Fuck Up', you won't sound as racist, especially on MLK Day. It won't change the fact that you ARE racist, but it may help, a little."
So when @realDonaldTrump says "Believe Me.." we know to NOT believe a word coming out of his mouth. So when he says "I'm the least racist person you've ever interviewed..." I think you can see where this is going.... #LiarInChief
@NBCNightlyNews @CBSEveningNews @ABCWorldNews since everyone on this #MLKDay talks about @POTUS being a racist why not show the country (world) that the very neice of #MLK himself #AlvedaKing emphatically denies @realDonaldTrump is a racist. I think she is pretty credible. pic.twitter.com/v8If4siJl7
I would argue that Stalin was less maniacal and more sociopathic. In that vein, I would argue that @realDonaldTrump is a sociopath, or at least flagrant self serving narcissist. In which case, he could, if he had the power, make similar decisions to Stalin.

By formulating a sentence like this you effectively prove that you are not a regulator racist, but an intellectually heavily challenged one @that. Why does he use words? I mean: what seems to @realDonaldTrump be the purpose of using words from a real language? biggest mystery!

I can't think of a more miserable way to honor Dr. King, than having to honor him with someone like @realDonaldTrump in office. We failed him, his dream and ourselves. There is no excuse.
