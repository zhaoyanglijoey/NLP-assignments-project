Notice that @realDonaldTrump only makes public appearances/press conferences when there's someone there like a foreign dignitary to hide behind/buffer/deflect the questions asked by the press (?), LOL
@larry_kudlow basically said @nikkihaley was a ditzy woman. The depth of misogynist racist and homophobic attitudes of team "lead" by @realDonaldTrump and in @GOP and #WhiteHouse is stunning.

Now 54 min into show and ZERO talk about #Abe visit, trade, #NorthKorea . Just @ErinBurnett waving arm's, shaking head & sighing with exasperation about @realDonaldTrump and #Russia . Just pathetic.
Stop Taking Our Money & STEP DOWN! This Is Bigotry! @GOP @GOPChairwoman We Demand An Ethics Review!!! @realDonaldTrump @VP
You should just focus on @realDonaldTrump and Russia in my opinion. Supporting @SenFeinstein 's opponent is counterproductive and destructive to the Democratic party. She is after all, one of the leading senior figures that will be vital when Donald Trump is impeached.

@realDonaldTrump you say the actions of Syria were barbaric. I actually agree. But honestly isn't ignoring the desperation in Puerto Rico, your own people not also a barbaric act? Granted it's a different level but still hate perpetrated by you on your own people. You pos!
Let me just add @realDonaldTrump told them to PEE, and PEE they did!!
I don't always agree with @nikkihaley , but she represents the United States the way we should be represented to the U.N. Strong & no nonsense. Unlike @realDonaldTrump , she commands respect around the world with both our allies & our adversaries. Unlike Trump, she is patriotic.
