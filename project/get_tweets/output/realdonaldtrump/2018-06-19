I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE THATS FUNNY LOL!!!! THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump for all you do
I saw several polls today who I think shows a crack in @realDonaldTrump s support. One regarding the children being held at border showed only 27%of country agrees. Another on wether he can pardon self. A decided change. Only 17% of Republican agreed. We are into the very worst

Imagine how clean @realDonaldTrump must be to have been able to withstand this assault on him by a crooked and biased @FBI , I know I wouldn't have withstood the scrutiny and I doubt most of those critical of Trump could either
Up here in Canada. With scuffed shoes. But wait..these shoes are Australian. And they're boots. So fuck you, @realDonaldTrump . I'll continue to get my 'highly-tariffed' footwear from somewhere other than your 'shithole country'. #cdnpoli
@realDonaldTrump you are a real sick and disgusting human being. Those children are being dehumanized and separated from their own parents while you just sit on your own pile of crap, blaming others for YOUR own mess. FIX THIS NOW #KeepFamilesTogether
@realDonaldTrump It's this weeks' diversion, remember the real news is FBI, Obama and his administration, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, The Clinton Foundation, The Muslim Brotherhood and of course Russia they are connected, not the way the media says.
Stop pushing out @realDonaldTrump lies. Report facts & not what Trump wants out there. Ivanka has not come out with any statement & THAT is a fact. Are you a reporter or a fiction writer?

@realDonaldTrump Just stop this NOW! All you have to do is pick up the phone and this could end in a manner of minutes. This is on you and that sniveling little bat boy Stephen Miller. Stop listening to him. He's a loser! Why can't you see that?!
withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council is fucking ludicrous. @realDonaldTrump what the hell are you doing you absolute fucking swine. how is this even justifiable. we are on the most influential countries do not continue to set heinous precedents. how do you care so little.

I am thankful EVERY SINGLE DAY @realDonaldTrump is our @POTUS .
@theresa_may Dear Prime Minister, please cancel the visit to the United Kingdom by @realDonaldTrump . He is currently wrenching children from their parents and imprisoning both, whist withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council. He is not our friend.
@realDonaldTrump is an asshole.
I think it's funny that when supporters of family separation are trying to blame it on everyone else but @realDonaldTrump , it never occurs to them that the President should aspire to be better. NVM. It's not funny. Kids are suffering. #KeepFamilesTogether
very important fact, @realDonaldTrump has the support of millions of US voters. Did you hear speech given today to @NFIB , judging from clapping, @NFIB stands behind with "full" support.
Hey asshole @realDonaldTrump #Hardball pic.twitter.com/0COBNVIAvx
@realDonaldTrump is in a trade war with himself and the loser is America. He creates problems and when they blow up in his face he fixes them with more problems. This is a @POTUS who was in violation of his oath well before he took it. Trump hates America. #Trumpistan
@realDonaldTrump , I am a nationalized citizen who came here with my parents at 10 yrs old. You are an embarrassment to the United States of America, your family, the flag, and the world. You've broken laws. Put Baron in a cage at a processing center. Equality. pic.twitter.com/wPNlJkymoA

@realDonaldTrump The recordings of separated immigrant children calling for "Mommy" and "Daddy" were probably taped at a McDonalds. I would believe La Moma and Papi. How stupid do they think we are?
@realDonaldTrump #WeSeeYou
Huge applause for @CharlieBakerMA signing the bill that insures reproductive coverage in MA despite what @realDonaldTrump continues to take away from women. MA, we are covered! @ProChoiceMass
@realDonaldTrump - Just know that the nation is against you and we will remember on election day that you and other Republicans chose to separate children from their parents. Your approval rate is shit because you are shit. #KeepFamilesTogether
@realDonaldTrump I have always voted my heart, third party mostly, Libertarian when i could. I have never gone to the polls to actively vote against any administration. This November that will change. You are bigly dumb. #Congratulations #POTUS #morelikePOSus

@coreylewandowski I hope you rot in Hell along with @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump We will say that we have been been fooled by Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Booth and Allen and Hammer, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman and many others run our government. They make billions everyday as long as war goes on and sell our identities working for the NSA. Vets
@FoxNews she had a chance to really come across as someone who had answers, a leader. Instead she gave a political pitch, Elizabeth Warren is another member of the clown car, why don't you go sit next to that sad sack of garbage that is @realDonaldTrump sad.

No, it started in April when @usagsessions @realdonaldtrump @SecNielsen john kelly & little stevie miller decided there were too POC & not enough whites & this was a way to stop the flow. Torture the kids. & it's thousands. & it looks & feels like kidnapping, caging, interning.
Michael Cohen is next to be thrown under the bus by @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump The trump folks who say we should "follow the law" and separate children from parents--were they all "follow the law" when Congress passed Obamacare?
@realDonaldTrump Lest you thought we'd forget your legal issues throughout all this bullshittery you've created about little children... Where's Paulie Numbnuts sleeping tonight? You really should ask him about the service quality there--you'll be joining him soon. Very soon.
