@realDonaldTrump patti davis talk about trump, on cnn now, all democrat are brainwashed
Wow @PressSec you must truly know your ticket to hell is punched. How can you with a straight face say that @realDonaldTrump is attempting to heal the country. It is obvious this administration is only out for itself.
Real hate started with the Obamas. Then candidate Barack Obama said, "They get bitter, and they cling to guns or religion." He body slammed Conservatives. The Truth is, Democrats are Psychopaths. #@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs pic.twitter.com/LG4hAts1q9
God Bless @POTUS @realDonaldTrump , America..... Trump in office until 2025
Excellent job @PressSec ! God Bless you! I wouldn't want to have to put up with the #LiberalMedia daily and you do a stellar job! God bless you and Thank you. Thank you for believing in our #POTUS45 @realDonaldTrump and thank you for putting #LilBabyJimAcosta @Acosta in his place
Every week, the left tries to light a Reichstag Fire to stoke domestic panic. Sadly, when they pull the wet matches out of their pockets, they forgot @realDonaldTrump made them piss their pants the last time they did it.
#MAGA @realDonaldTrump
Only people who think @realDonaldTrump should tone it down are those who wouldn't vote for him 1 way or the other. He appeals to his base. Cookoos like McVeigh, Sayoc will always be around...
Liberals will never accept that @realDonaldTrump is going to be our fantastic president for a total of 8 years! They can't stand it that our country is finally heading in the right direction. Well, they can go eat crow.
@realDonaldTrump = #osmaBinLadden . He is redicalizing the white terrorist and no wall will keep them out!
I see your hurt liberal feelings are blinding you to the amazing progress @realDonaldTrump is making in nearly all aspects of the country. You liberals are dinosaurs facing extinction and are fighting to keep your gravy train. You have had your experiment. Your time is over.
The mere idea that @realDonaldTrump understands more than any of the anchors at CNN is pretty laughable!
RT @Ozzymoto27 : George Clooney's response to @realDonaldTrump after he called him a hollywood elite is a great read. pic.twitter.com/TYsxj00ljT

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump may have multiple stars paved, but Donald Trump is no star. All Donald Trump really is just a brainwashing lying unfit president and a threat too the American people!
You are NOT an American!!! You are the enemy... you and all other #FakeNews are dividing our nation. Not @realDonaldTrump . You talk trash about our President multiple times per day. I hated @BarackObama but I dealt with it for 8 years!! Now we are on the track to success. #MAGA

But the media DOES accurately report what he says. Which to @realDonaldTrump makes them his enemy.
So @realDonaldTrump is visiting @CityofPgh tomorrow? Odd since he was told to "Not step into Pennsylvania until he denounces white nationalists." But what do I know? He's going to a city that resoundingly voted against him in 2016, to comfort a Jewish congregation that believes
I can't agree more. He's trying to impress his audience, so it can say oh look Macron is standing to @realDonaldTrump . He's still a product of globalists. They put him there to save the EU. Time will tell.
@realDonaldTrump until Republicans apologize for you being president, they will no longer be a party I consider a legitimate political organization. You are wrong and they are wrong. In everyway imaginable!
@realDonaldTrump Please, sir, respect the wishes of the people of Philly. Let them bury their dead in peace. Your visit will disrupt a city already stretched thin. For your safety and theirs, stay home Tuesday.
@jaketapper @pattieDavis is right.Reporter should stop asking @realDonaldTrump any question.He just lies anyway. #stopaskinghimquestion
@realDonaldTrump has been a defender and protector of the Jewish community in the USA and Israel. He has been a true friend of the Jewish people everywhere. May he continue winning!
@realDonaldTrump TRUMP, HITLER IS RESPONSIBLE 4 HOLOCAUST. HITLER DESIGNED THE KILLING MACHINES, THE CAMPS (JUST LIKE UR DETENTION CAMPS WHERE CHILDREN R DYING CUZ U HAVEN'T DONE WHAT A JUDGE ORDERED U TO DO). WE DO BLAME HITLER-IS ARCHITECT OF HOLOCAUST. READ OR WATCH ON NETFLIX
@realDonaldTrump WTH WTH WTH ????
@realDonaldTrump President Trump. Thankk God you are sending more military for the borders. Have all the borders in those states send in their national guard. I made a comment to Martinez in NM. She turned on us. I told her to send water trucks to use if crowd gets out of control
If we skip to 49:30, in this video @realDonaldTrump says he would be @cnn 's biggest fan if they reported fairly, he's ok with criticism as long as it's honest. @ScottAdamsSays https:// youtu.be/jE4FuwR5CDU
@AprilDRyan President Trump is an American Nationalist. The only color @realDonaldTrump sees is green. He wants to help all Americans see lots of green in their pockets.
@realDonaldTrump should go to the southern border and watch his military parade. He wanted one now he has one!
@georgesoros must be handed over to Israel and @netanyahu and tried for crimes against Israel and the Israeli people. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump "....called for Americans to "unify" and strive for civility..." Sure, OK, no problem. You go first.
@realDonaldTrump Thank God you pulled the United States out of the UNs Migrant Compact. You are most wise more so than people will ever comprehend.
We need the national guard to actually guard our border. Put them there @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Happy Halloween to the first family!
Thank You President @RealDonaldTrump STAND amen yes it is an invasion who carries a flag of a country they want to flee? Only an invading army.
@realDonaldTrump you are a wart on the ass of humanity.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump - LISTEN. HEAR IS THE MEASSAGE. ITS THE GUNS. ITS TIME FOR SENSIBLE GUN CONTROL.
time for you or @1776Stonewall to do a Massive Tweet Storm to @realDonaldTrump about this regarding Fox and we all Tweet and Retweet it to him.
Wow anyone else trying to retweet tweet only to see that they have been deleted? @realDonaldTrump #Qanon
Dear @realDonaldTrump : The media did not say the below. YOU did: "Any guy who can do a body slam is my kind of guy" "Very fine people on both sides" at White Nationalist mob event in Charlottesville "Knock the crap out of them ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees"
@realDonaldTrump People see your facade. Had any good horse faces lately? Stop harrassing people and bring this country together. Let the press tell the truth what you did in russia. watch out for waterfalls mr horses mouth.
Again, @realDonaldTrump caught in a another scam, and will the complicit @GOP do a damned thing about it...nope. #GriftersGottaGrift
The @realDonaldTrump presidency has become an actual and real national security threat. Giving rise to terrorism with your political discourse is extremely dangerous and alarming. #MakeAmericaSafeAgain #MASA

I keep hearing Democrats campaign on healthcare. If they don't like our Healthcare system it is their fault, We have the healthcare program they gave us (Obama Care). Why aren't Republicans reminding the Dems & American People about this. @realDonaldTrump
Martha do you think that women, suburbans moms who voted for Trump in 2016 thought he would change his style? We voted for Trump bc he is genuine, original, we don't want him to change. We him just the way he is. Don't ever change always be @realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum
@realDonaldTrump is the biggest ENEMY of the people!
@realDonaldTrump is a drama queen. 14,000 troop deployment is obviously wasteful, a midterm distraction, but mostly a SHOW OF FORCE against his political opponents, MOST OF US IN AMERICA. Not needed for refugees legally seeking asylum. Could have been used to help in #PuertoRico

Is there anything you won't lie about or spin to fit your narrative? @realDonaldTrump lies every time he opens his mouth; whether talking about immigrants, violence, or Democrats. The only person he defends is himself.

Just in case you havrn't taken good notes: @realDonaldTrump is a pathological liar.
@realDonaldTrump you are so good at assigning blame and shirking responsibility. You are so good at making up things and making money. You are the best at lying and cheating. Just what we want our children to be. Maybe you could teach them.. perhaps a Trump University?
Only 8 more days until the election! If you live in #CA08 , be sure to vote Paul Cook for Congress, the only candidate in the race for #CA08 endorsed by the President, @realDonaldTrump !
This is why your support of @realDonaldTrump puzzles me. I love your music. I always will.

@realDonaldTrump you are without doubt the most insensitive, boorish lout I've ever heard of. Nobody in Pittsburgh wants your hateful, racist fat ass to go there. Stay in your room, watch fox and STFU.
@PressSec How do you live with that disgusting taste in your mouth with all of the bullshit that comes out of it day after day? You know damn well that @realDonaldTrump LOST the election with the POPULAR VOTE going to @HillaryClinton by 3 MILLION VOTES Just stop lying for one day
@cnn promoted @realDonaldTrump during the primaries, giving him hundreds of millions of dollars of free air time, thinking @HillaryClinton would destroy him, then once he was the nominee they turned on him. As far as I'm concerned he will always be the #CNNpresident haha
@realDonaldTrump Do us Americans a quick solid and stop these #robocalls thank you
@realDonaldTrump please close the border. Thank You!
Pittsburgh Mayor @billpeduto is an inspiration. Time to unite and appeal to the better angels . It would be helpful if @realDonaldTrump followed this advice.
I can hardly wait until our #GetOffMyLawn Potus, @realDonaldTrump is out of our #WhiteHouse . In the meantime, #VoteBlue2018 #Peace #Shalom

Matt all that cable news does is report the facts and what other people are saying. Your comments are not fair. @realDonaldTrump needs to stop lying to the American public about fake news, caravans with middle eastern men and isis, crowd size and decent people on both sides
Isn't the crypt keeper @KellyannePolls Jewish? Didn't she say she was a victim of sexual assault? @realDonaldTrump must be grabbing u by ur p@ssy & paying u from those taxes & payments from the Russians 4u2 sell ur "soul". Do this need to happen 2 you'll DIRECTLY 4u2 get da point
So @realDonaldTrump thinks churches should have armed personnel. FOUR of the trained police officers were shot. They couldn't defend themselves against an AR-15, so unless you want EVERYONE to carry around AR-15s, then maybe you should rethink this inept blather.
. @PamelaEvette I agree with you!!! We can call out hate speech. We should. Are you and your running mate @henrymcmaster willing to call out the hate speech of @realDonaldTrump #SCLtGovDebate
