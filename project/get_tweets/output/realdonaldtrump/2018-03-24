@realDonaldTrump You are...an incredible pussy. Fuck you, asshole #POTUS #tinypenispresident
Where was our President today? Golfing as usual while Americans demand Gun laws! Impeach now @realDonaldTrump
Do you follow @realDonaldTrump ? How big of a statement from a woman who threw the first insult without showing her face
Cowardly! Just like when he got his 5 draft deferments. @realDonaldTrump will always be a coward!
. @realDonaldTrump why do you leave town charging taxpayers for endless golf outings at your family businesses every time there's a parade in DC? Seems you'll only appreciate them when you've commanded reverence and adulation from those wielding weapons of war. #PhonyPresident
. @realDonaldTrump needs to go first. #LeadTheWay #DrainTheSwamp
It's Time To Stand Up To @realDonaldTrump @NRA @DLoesch @GOP &EVERY Person Who Can Do Something To End #GunViolence & Do NOTHING To Protect Us We Are More Important Than Your Guns & Money We Need To Vote Out EVERYONE Who Accepts #NRABloodMoney It's Time For CHANGE #NeverAgain pic.twitter.com/UKXcMPJ96p

@realDonaldTrump to only break that one to
@realDonaldTrump hey Trump the Chump, anything to say about the 800,000 person March For Our Lives that made your inauguration look like a high school pep rally?

@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump @GENUG @seanhannity @JudgeJeanine @PressSec Newt, your article is a great outlook of what we face & what to be done. I always thought you were a great indivual. You always take beyond the realm of possibility & instill this sense of reality we need
Hold on Auntie....Let me check with @JerryFalwellJr and @Franklin_Graham and I'll get back with you. It's probably in the part where it says how many mulligans a #LiarInChief @realDonaldTrump gets!!! pic.twitter.com/INQ0aU8zyD
That fact that @realDonaldTrump signed a bill that nobody read, and this fact ALONE, proves that he is more of the same and the swamp is in complete control. #betrayed
Not a peep from @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump or Mitch McConnell today..guess ya know who's back they got $$$ @NRA owned #MarchForOurLives
. @realDonaldTrump how about those crowds? Yuge, right?
@realDonaldTrump can we expect photos showing your inauguration crowd was larger than the crowd today in DC for Walk for Our Lives? 800,000 strong! And where were you? Oh, that's right golfing!!
My daily reminder that @repjohnlewis is a genuine American HERO! Did not attend #buffoon #Trump inauguration. Sad Reminder: @HillaryClinton and @BernieSanders did attend buffoon @realDonaldTrump inauguration. #TrumpIsNotMyPresident #ImpeachTrumpNow pic.twitter.com/2RiZWwSToP
Where is @realDonaldTrump during all this... no word on the marches....hmmmm shows what he really cares about huh ?? #1A #MarchForOurLives .
@realDonaldTrump Any chance you might visit Parkland while you're in the area, or would it interfere with your golf??
Hey @realDonaldTrump take a look at this. This young man served this country. He now needs help and you're demanding a f*cking parade. You don't deserve such an honor. The can help so many Vets. #NoMilitaryParade #VetsAgainstTrump #vetsagainsttheparade #FuckTrump #Resist pic.twitter.com/6mI4S7E1Tw

@realDonaldTrump The border wall is for national defense. Take a few billion $'s from the national defence budget and have the army corp of engineers build it until the real funding comes through.
@realDonaldTrump In case u were wondering, you blithering child... pic.twitter.com/0aLmqwXgSw
You sound just like @realDonaldTrump funny that.
You are rationalizing. The Wall is far more significant than China posturing. @realDonaldTrump got to #BuildThatWall ASAP, and lead #Congress to do the job of the right, they were elected to do. We must elect more true @gop reps & senators.

No-one organizes marches for @POTUS & @GOP . @realDonaldTrump has rallies but otherwise, there is no organization to fight back. Why not? Who has the power to take the lead? @GOPChairwoman ? Seems @GOP is fractured between RINOs & NeverTrumpers & Trump Republicans. Worrisome.

1) Considering is not threatening. 2) @realDonaldTrump kept another campaign promise to rebuild the Military BIGLY!!! We needed DemocRATS to do this, and the CR's have gutted the Military. It's the DemocRATS all should be upset with for putting so much waste in this bill.
Will be the highest rated 60 minutes episode in history. Believe me @realDonaldTrump and the illegal immigrant @FLOTUS will be watching
@realDonaldTrump Just another lie from #45.
Several years ago, I said the November 2016 election was NOT about political parties, but, rather about GOOD vs EVIL! We are VERY THANKFUL that GOOD trumped evil, w/ the election of our great @POTUS ! God Bless @realDonaldTrump & God Bless America!
The divisiveness promoted by @realDonaldTrump makes this almost impossible. Your politics is solely about money, and the @NRA has plenty of it, as you are both all too well aware. November can't come soon enough for most people. Assuming you both make it? #SSSSFS #NarciTrump
@realDonaldTrump Oh yes, comment on #MarchForOurLives maybe, you naval-gazing cock?
@realDonaldTrump @GOP This is the problem with your masters, the @NRA . Let's enact responsible gun control (bump stocks, assault weapons), enforce background checks, & restrict guns from mentally ill. #MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/U4IjnfpJMD

Looking forward to @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @mike_pence to say anything about this historic day. Pretty clear dead kids don't matter 2 them.
@realDonaldTrump doing China an amazing favor: forcing them to double down on their investment in manufacturing for the domestic market - things they wouldn't've gotten to as quickly they'll be all over, at our expense. #KeepWinningDonald
The people who think @realDonaldTrump is a tyrant want to take away ur ability to fight against a tyrannical government? #MarchForOurLives
And had his car diverted to miss the protesters. @realDonaldTrump is a coward!
@realDonaldTrump 45 & his family should give up protection as well as GOP. GOP and 45 say teachers should be armed to protect kids! So take police away from GOP and 45 and let pages carry guns to protect them or Staff for 45! Sounds fair to us.

Sick. That's why I liked @realDonaldTrump . The only thing I liked about him actually. He called them out: "Big Pharma getting away with murder." I was like, finally someone named that band of criminals! Yes, they are murdering ppl DT. But then the sucker went in office and bowed.

#OzTouristProblems there is a crazy guy behind a wall or curtain calling all the shots and not keeping his promises sounds like @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BetsyDeVosED easily could be Wicked Witch of the West
Much bigger crowd than @realDonaldTrump had for his inauguration. That should annoy #Trump . This impotus #POTUS #Trump & his #GOP bootlickers, in hock to the #NRA , are a stain on #USA politics.
Almost ? No. He most Certainly has an agenda @realDonaldTrump
I'd have more respect for @JacobAWohl if he joined the military but like the other former 20 something coward @realDonaldTrump big mouth, big money, little heart and use it to impugn kids his age who were shot at or killed while in school. I wonder what his mother thinks of him
Is this the innauguration? No it's BIGGER @realDonaldTrump
@SpeakerRyan =SNAKE IN THE GRASS @realDonaldTrump DO NOT TRUST THIS DEMOLIBTARD
@realDonaldTrump spineless wimp, scared of a few kids. That was a really dumb move. He blew an opportunity to show some compassion and guts, but I guess the memo said, " ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ISSUES!"

@JohnBrabender @realDonaldTrump Interesting that those at the marches today carried signs to protest those who carry assault weapons while our president carried golf clubs.

If @realDonaldTrump gets impeached. The country is basically over. Nothing will happen from then on. People will get free things, police and military will barely be funded at all. America, once great and powerful, will fall.

@realDonaldTrump Very disappointed!!!!! We trusted U.
@realDonaldTrump GET THE D** WALL BUILT...YOU OWE IT TO THOSE THAT VOTED FOR YOU !!!!

If we get rid of the filibuster we can isolate things like planned parenthood. I thought @realDonaldTrump explained that. I think we need to use this midterm to vote in people that will get rid of the filibuster. He needs us as much as we need him!
Pt 7 Congress Screws USA Summarized @realDonaldTrump signed bill so our military could get pay raises & up 2 date equipment. The POS Congress members who took another undeserved raise should've donated their pay raise 2 military. Kids march on DC Adults time 2 march on DC MAGA

Of course @realDonaldTrump skipped DC! You expect him to stay to listen to the voices of our soon to be voting citizens. Bravo to @Emma4Change and all students who have demonstrated strong & wise expressions due to life experiences that have effected them and their safety.
@realDonaldTrump would have been nice to see a TWEET about the demonstrations all over the USA. DESPITE YOU....we will MAGA.
The more I read re Omnibus Bill 2018, the more I think we're all over-reacting. Yes, there r funds appropriated/authorized 4 things that go vs r morals, but that doesn't mean @POTUS has 2 actually spend those funds! Fear not! @realDonaldTrump will keep his promises! #MAGA :D

I think @realDonaldTrump must be afraid of real large crowds. Lol Crawled off to Shit-Hole-A-Lago. Instead of facing Americas youth. Probably has to report to his Russian handlers. I am not kidding about that. Should be checked
With respect to Gun Violence It is because of the individual So treat the individual & reduce Gun Violence Also most school violence incidents Is because the individual was "bullied" Not just mentally disturbed So address school bullying & Stop revenge killing @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump I can't believe you signed that bill. You let many of us who voted for you down. What a disaster you've become. Enjoy the last few months of your presidency before the democrats impeach you. I'm not even going to vote in the midterms. There's no point.
