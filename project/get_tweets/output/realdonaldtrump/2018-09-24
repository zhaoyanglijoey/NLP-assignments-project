We can no longer be the silent majority. We need people to actually turn up to the polls and vote these pricks out of office. It's time to drop the hammer on them @realDonaldTrump we need shit declassified Democrats arrested & held accountable for their actions or they won't stop

@realDonaldTrump @dbongino @FoxNews @CNNPolitics We own the governorships, we own the Senate, we own the House, now we have the chance to own the Supreme Court. DO NOT BACK DOWN. Hold the vote! Speak your voice loudly, VOTE R IN NOV, then we will own it all. Except the MSM

Dems: @realDonaldTrump is undermining the excellent work of the @fbi Also Dems: 6 @fbi background checks are not enough for #KavanaughConfirmation they obviously don't know how to do their job
I don't even see @realDonaldTrump tweets unless I go to his page
That is exactly what turned me into a @realDonaldTrump supporter. The left and #CNN kept lying over and over. Didn't take long for me to catch on. Problem is millions are still buying those lies, hook, line and sinker.

I wouldn't vote @DNC ever again. I chose to #WalkAway from their hatred & childishness. But, instead of donating to @GOP @NRSC or @NRCC , just donate to your favorite super PAC. The best one I've found that supports @realDonaldTrump & true swamp-drainers is America First Action.

Or he just knows there is no way to prove it and those "sluts" got abused just like all the "sluts" that were paid off by @realDonaldTrump
. @Scavino45 . @KellyannePolls . @Scavino45 . @realDonaldTrump . @DonaldJTrumpJr . @ChuckGrassley I know Kavanaugh was reserved on the Fox interview tonight, but I agree he needs to show his anger about what is happening to him. It's okay for him to be pissed (I am!).
We've sunk so low that our next president will be the reanimated corpse of Billy Mays. @robreiner @DavidCornDC @rudepundit @realDonaldTrump
I believe the left has desparately miscalculated on this one. How many drunken parties did Democrats attend? How many investigations do you want? Remember how you got @realDonaldTrump elected by ignoring that part of America that exists between the coasts. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats

I have a question for you @realDonaldTrump - The United States has a $10B trade deficit with Russia. As @POTUS , why aren't you levying tariffs on Putin's country? And why isn't anyone talking about it??
Evilness is resorting to destroying an innocent persons life, in pursuit of an agenda. @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein @SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley #ConfirmKavanaghNow
COULD ROSENSTEIN BE @realDonaldTrump 's NEW BF? Not that I don't think he shouldn't be fired,but "AFTER THE ELECTION!" However,' an " #FBI pal"'SET ROSENSTEIN,UP! Only someone in'THAT MEETING' had the information,and LEAKED IT TO THE NYT. @DonaldJTrumpJr #QAnon , #tcot , #hardball

So, DO NOT CONFIRM KAVANAUGH ... who would give @realDonaldTrump the Power to Pardon HIMSELF!! Oh ... and then there's the HE'S A RAPIST thing. What the hell more do you need?!

We can clearly see that @realDonaldTrump is a hand puppet of the evil blood thirsty NaZionist John Bolton. Bolton supports Israel even if they were to carry out a Holocaust. Trump has no power or independence from the NaZionists.
@realDonaldTrump Defund and reform domestic violence major corruption goes on in the lower courts! its a sham! and this government gives millions of money to this program reform domestic violence! enough! make America Great again!
@realDonaldTrump your chance to right a wrong, fire Rod Rosenstein!
And this was an orchestrated attack on #BrettKavanaugh by the left. They made it clear that they would do whatever it takes to block any nominee @realDonaldTrump puts up for SCOTUS.
Or @SenateMajLdr could recess the Senate and @realDonaldTrump could put Kavanaugh on SCOTUS as a recess appointment. Been done before .......

All republicans care about is getting their way. Namely, Securing more tax breaks for wealthy. Destroying programs that help people. Polluting our planet. Enacting regressive policies based in bigotry & sexism. Protecting criminal traitor @realDonaldTrump from American justice.

he wasnt going to be fired either. @realDonaldTrump understood when he said he said it sarcastically. not everyone in the US has lost their sense of humor. just the ones on the left of the isle and media
Under no circumstances should @realDonaldTrump use leaked memos and disputed press reports about Rod Rosenstein as an excuse to undermine the Mueller probe. The investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 election must continue without political interference. #25thAmendmentNow
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity My take on Kavanaugh. Wonderful, Gentle man. I believe him when he said ,he did not do it. Don't laugh, But this man would not have taken PUSSY, in high school if the girls poured it all over him. OMG he was petrified of getting someone Pregnant
Make @realDonaldTrump think about humanity as meaning all humankind not just the rich & powerful Also his club of his yes men & women #MakeImpossiblePossible
Why should Twitter be 'nicer' to a selfish, boastful, deliberately ignorant, undisciplined, sadistic egotist, @realdonaldtrump ?The bigger you get, the harder you'll fall. You may've won, however illegitimately, but you will wish you hadnt when your fortune's gone. It can happen

@realDonaldTrump we know you don't know how to use technology very well so here's how its gonna go down: 1. You fire Rosenstein on Thursday we take to the streets to protest and live stream Dr. Blasey and the Sexual Predator's hearing. 2. It's called "a hole in two strokes."
If nothing else, it's nice to know that when #Kavanaugh picks his (alleged) victims, unlike @realDonaldTrump , he doesn't discriminate against Latinas.
