@HardballChris you're out of time for today so how about asking @maddow if she can give us one platform position for #democrats that helps #KeepAmericaGreat ? @DNC position is we #hate a great #America . PS @realDonaldTrump is still @POTUS
. @GOPChairwoman : This is good for our TRAITOR @realDonaldTrump , it is part of our plan to crush democracy, and I hope the Senate will keep the lid on the fire so we can confirm the hand-picked @Scotus to stop @BobSMueller & @TheDemocrats from exposing the TRUTH. #MAGA

Absolutely CHIZ ... this is a remarkable time in history. Can you even begin to imagine what this would be like if Hillary had won and had the power to make a #SCOTUSNomination ... OMG!! Soooooo for @realDonaldTrump !!!
Dear Mr @realDonaldTrump please can you advise me as to whether New Zealand is on your list for being a #ShitHoleCountry ? I think I deserve an answer from you, seeing as it was you personally that started the whole shithole thing. You have many un-educated followers. SAD
Update: I'm still blocked by @SteveDaines even though the judge stated in the @knightcolumbia v @realDonaldTrump decision that elected officials are assumed to follow the law. Precedent established, good sir. #mtpol
@realDonaldTrump meeting with #KimJongUn is a facade and absolutely meaningless - #KimJongUn has no interest in #DenuclearizeDeal - @NorthKoreaDPRK Played #America like a fool Negotiations are #FAKENEWS @POTUS and Now Both @Iran & #KimJongUn Has #NuclearWeapons Looks like #WWIII
A lot going on folks! #SCOTUSPICK today! Apparently at 9:00 pm ET. This is an opportunity for @realDonaldTrump to knock it out of the park! Remember, the Democrats created the nuclear option so a simple majority approves a Justice. What are your opinions?
Don't leave any of these beautiful conservative women alone with @realDonaldTrump , or they may turn into Democrats!

Amazing how @realDonaldTrump is so anti-immigrant when two of his wives are immigrants. @FLOTUS is an immigrant but she is from an old USSR state. Bottom line... #TraitorTrump only wants immigrants who are not brown or black. Isn't that an indication of #WhiteSupremacy
@realDonaldTrump is a Russian Asset and the ENTIRE Cabinet is being investigated by #Mueller . I feel sorry for your family with the treasonous legacy you'll leave behind. You're very old, you'll die, and they'll have to bear your infamy. #McConnellFamilyValues
@campusreform again exposes the dishonesty and stupidity of US College Students who say what a racist and bigoted choice for SCOTUS was by @realDonaldTrump when he has not even announced it yet. I hope their college debt cripples them for life.
#ScotusPick @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @WhiteHouse Please Mr. President pick someone who believes in the Constitution and that it is the law and the guiding document of our great Republic!!! We're counting on you
@marthamaccallum @GOP @FoxNews @campusreform The college kids are so dumb, because they watch CNN. That's what happens when you lower your standards of living. They all think @realDonaldTrump is racist. They have no clue! A picture is worth 1000 words... pic.twitter.com/psN57H66Fl
Never forget this is about light and darkness nothing else, don't trust the change @realDonaldTrump people are waking up and they've switched to act like we are together including some news stations
9:01pm EST, all Democrats, Liberals and lefts will forget about Immigration and focus on the @realDonaldTrump 's #SupremeCourtJustice pick! "The selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 PM." @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld
Congrats @realDonaldTrump ! This is you making America Great Again
. @SenSchumer Hey, here's a bright idea if you're serious about resisting @realDonaldTrump . It involves, who would have thought, actually resisting him. Are you on board, or is that Israel money going to hold you back?
Dear #British friends, make @realDonaldTrump feel your scorn. Bring on #BabyTrumpBlimp and British civility. It will make him squirm!
Hello my great followers! To be clear, President @realDonaldTrump has chosen to release his nominee pick tonight during the Sean Hannity hour. Great Job Mr. President. I will not be flipping over to #CNN even for a moment. I refuse to give them even a second of 'viewer ratings'.
SO glad Ruth is a supreme court justice and you were NEVER Vice President, elected or appointed to ANY federal office/position. You're a crazy nobody that not even the MEGA (MAGA=NAZI) fool @realDonaldTrump wants ANYTHING to do with!
https:// nyti.ms/2m2wZVY 3x married, 2x divorcee, serial adulterer, sexual predator #ConManDan aka @realDonaldTrump just hired someone FIRED by @FoxNews for sexual harassment and for this, he'll no doubt continue to get the support of #familyvalues groups like @TFFVA #UnReal
Tonight @realDonaldTrump will nominate a new Supreme Court Justice, who will help shape the Court for decades to come. What potential Supreme Court issues are most important to you?
Seems about right for @realDonaldTrump and @Trump pic.twitter.com/HWFLZgEp3D
@SenateMajLdr & @realDonaldTrump 's necks apparently have left Washington... Has anyone seen them?
#ScotusPick , so far @realDonaldTrump has done or is working on what he said he would do. So I will gladly support his next pic for our court. Trust him 100% more than our last pic. He stands for America and the rights of the people. Also, unborn children should have rights. #2a
F.U.C.K Y.O.U. @realDonaldTrump
Heading to @WhiteHouse for #SCOTUS announcement by @realDonaldTrump at 9pm ET. It seems that it is down to Kavanaugh, Hardiman and Kethledge. Who do you think will be the nominee?
Why does @SenSanders get airtime? And when did @OutFrontCNN Erin become brainwashed by the @CNN way??!! @CNN training handbook = hate @realDonaldTrump or look for other work! = worst TV ratings!
I'm still holding out hope that @realDonaldTrump will appear on TV tonight to say he's leaving Washington DC and taking his talents to South Beach. #ScotusPick

@realDonaldTrump Fort Irwin National Training Center is a major training area for the United States Military and is a census-designated place located in the Mojave Desert in northern San Bernardino County, California. We need to move the training rotation from NTC to the border.
@realDonaldTrump I think you should nominate the ghost of Joseph Wapner for SCOTUS. My sources tell me he was spotted near the Whitehouse today. SCOTUS is The Peoples Court after all.

Yep, everyone wants a piece. First time ever hearing of this. Why didn't he mention it during the 25 years @realDonaldTrump was kind enough to give him work during terrible economic times? Because some Dem. has put him up to it. This driver is already being paid off, by the Dems.

Announce 3 #scotus nominees tonight. Stack the court @realDonaldTrump and #maga .
Tonight, @realDonaldTrump will name his #SCOTUSPick to succeed Justice Kennedy. Sadly, everyone on his shortlist is both anti-choice and anti-ACA. I stand with the American people as we demand a nominee who won't pursue an ultra-conservative agenda from the bench. #WhatsAtStake
Why is this Supreme Court Judge appointment so big for @realDonaldTrump ? Trying to understand. Someone explain? Why is there so much coverage etc over this appointment?
The 14th amendment needs abolished. @realDonaldTrump @RealMAGASteve @freedom_moates

@realDonaldTrump there is a family from Tupelo, Ms. stranded in Aruba and needing the family flown home. The father/grandfather was diagnosed with cancer in January. He wanted to take one last trip with his family to Aruba. He passed away yesterday while in Aruba. They need help.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, the Democrat's are going to attack you and everything you do regardless of it being right or wrong, continue doing the right things, counter their attacks by replacing all those that don't support our agenda such as Rosenstein, Sessions, Wray.
No flack,it is the truth. All involved in this atrocity have a reserved spot at The Hague @realDonaldTrump

Sean is just marginally smarter than @realDonaldTrump , maybe 2-3 IQ points, 88-86.
How dare he? After blocking Obama from choosing a Justice in an election year, @realDonaldTrump is under investigation! He has quite possibly committed Treason! & just because he's the biggest IDIOT to walk the Earth isn't an excuse!
If Pres @realDonaldTrump selected d woman jurist from #Chicago that would be interesting cuz Pres Obama wanted other jurist from #Chicago on @Scotus whom was on my 3 judge appellant court panel? d #February2008 ruling consistent w/an Obama jurist!! POTUS pick more #Scaliatype

One day Bret will write about a far more amiable US-RUSSIAN story. The steamy affair between Vladimir Putin and @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump Any comments about this resignation? See what you have caused? Fox is our version of RT (Russian TV controlled by Putin, if you didnt know)
As long as @realDonaldTrump picks someone that defends the unborn, to suck up to the Christians; we don't really care if he (or she) helps to take power away from the people and empowers the corporate donor class and the executive branch--is that the bargain? #ScotusPick
@realDonaldTrump I feel very strongly that Chairman Kim Jong Un wants to be Economic champion of North Korea and seen as #Trump of North Korea
