@TheStoryFNC Ladies.. Please remember, #Twitter is exactly like a bathroom.. When people are fed up with something and want their opinions and views heard, they take a seat and let fly. Nobody using Twitter to bash is having regular movements. @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump IS NOTabove the law! He is a man who is engaging in criminal behavior and is the biggest threat to the security of this country and every person living here! If he's goes after Mueller it is time to mobilize!
@realDonaldTrump is the epitome of corruptness, greed and racism! He must not be allowed to stay in the WH! #InstalledByPutin #NotElected #GOPRemoveTrumpNow #GOPComplicit
@realDonaldTrump is the best President we have had in our lifetime.
The question is how do we get back to this vision for our republic? The people I used to have faith in have rolled over to @realDonaldTrump Very disillusioned
You're tongue up @realDonaldTrump tush!

@Rosie https:// youtu.be/GAFnQrJ10is @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump This chick is nuts.
I disrespected the media long before @realDonaldTrump came around.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for cancelling your unnecessary parade which would have cost the taxpayers millions. What do you call an idiot who saves people from a chaotic situation he created? smh
So true which is why @realDonaldTrump wins again. I love him - just the right for the at this
Removing security clearance of Brennan is obviously being done as a political tool. The sad thing is the REAL political tool is @realDonaldTrump
Brennan voted for the communist candidate back two decades ago - or longer - how did he ever get a top-security clearance in OUR government! @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/nFZbMyk4NC

@realDonaldTrump SHAMEFUL!
Good! Stay over there @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump can't spell huh
@realDonaldTrump Trump was much more eager to take action against John Brennan than against Vladimir Putin.
Saying a woman is leading the Republican Party is a bit of a stretch. We know that @realDonaldTrump has #NoBalls but although he is a #FecklessCu *t he doesn't actually have one. so you cant really say he is a woman. I suppose you could say the same about @DonaldJTrumpJr too
The @SalvationArmyUS could have a parade instead of our military and @realDonaldTrump wouldn't know the difference.

#BragAboutYourGeneration The National Anthem played when the networks signed off at midnight. Maybe @realDonaldTrump could bring it back. Play after each press conference & speech. backhttps://youtu.be/ZHqA83gdBwA
@realDonaldTrump I believe that God chose you to save our beautiful GREAT America, to expose all these terrible crimes/criminals. Please hang in there, hoping it will all be exposed soon and you will be seen as the Greatest President ever. God bless you & America!
I'm afraid for our country! I know trumpers say move to a different country if you don't like @realDonaldTrump but how many of them that hated my beloved @BarackObama moved to a different country?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump and family and all the cabinet members that follow POTUS, and your families, I say; May the Lord bless and keep you, guide and direct you and give you strength, and keep you from harm.
I couldn't care less what Harf has to say. All she does is spew her hatred for @realDonaldTrump Whenever she talks, I mute her. pic.twitter.com/GKlxcTTJE0
@realDonaldTrump You taught Don Jr. how to be a dirtbag like you. You taught Eric how to lie and cheat You taught Ivanka how to take advantage of people But the best lesson you taught anyone, was the lessons you taught @OMAROSA ! America thanks you Vote @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems

@realDonaldTrump is definitely thinking about it. Hopefully, he will act.
Lot of #Demonrats and not the Russians voted for @realDonaldTrump in 2016.
@realDonaldTrump As my President, President Obama who will always Bmy President said many times you did not have the temperament 2 B the president of this country. Take those who voted 4you and your family and move to Siberia and run that Shit Hole as a dictator that you are.

@realDonaldTrump does @HillaryClinton still have a security clearance? If so, why? Are you going to revoke hers and that of her former closest staff members? #MAGA2020

John Brennan voted for the Communist Party in 1976, THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR! Between that, his many lies, dangerous policies and defense of terror organizations, he should never have had his position in the 1st place! #CrazyJohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman pic.twitter.com/TkdPSHuUGF

Wow what a professional u r, talking about the President of the United States like that. No wonder the Govt is a mess, u people have NO CLASS OR RESPECT!! @realDonaldTrump America, we are safer, stronger and United. You and your cronies just cant handle a REAL PRESIDENT. pathetic
Waiting for @realDonaldTrump to tweet that "conclusions are not a crime".
@realDonaldTrump Just watched your cabinet meeting!!! HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY THAT I LOVE YOU????? HAVE I TOLD YOU JUST HOW MUCH I CARE? I think that's Rod Stewart.......not sure. Just started singing this while I was watching....and wanted to share! Thank you Mr President!
But Trump said The Wall Street Journal is FAKE NEWS, or is @SecretaryRoss , the @WhiteHouse , and @realDonaldTrump FAKE NEWS?! I guess it's the same as always, News is only FAKE when you don't agree with it. Such BS!

@realDonaldTrump has a lot to say about how experienced politicians do their job. Americans need a president not a real estate agent
Wow, Slimeball @realDonaldTrump doing an excellent job running our Country Can't Dance but has done more 4 Country in last year 1/2 than his predecessor- thats for sure & ALL 4 being Politically Incorrect ! #foxnews #nytimes #wsj #cnbc #politico #huffpost #msnbc #bbc #gop #npr pic.twitter.com/8RTP8l2PbW

When #TDS starts to overwhelm me, I think of @realDonaldTrump as a form of pestilence, like Ebola or Avian-flu. It's clearly pointless directing anger at a damn virus, and you can better focus on finding a vaccine, which may be easier than finding a pair of gonads in the @GOP
Would you let him keep Security clearance, to this man that committed a crime or crimes, first by using a foreign spy to meddle in our elections and for profiting from an investigation with his wife! @realDonaldTrump hell no

@realDonaldTrump @dcexaminer @AGJeffBSessions Ending security clearance for Brennan was clearly correct - based on his complicity with the phony dossier. He was a commie SOB and if some admiral is stupid enough to not see that then he can ship out too. @JudgeJeanine

I thought @realDonaldTrump was the one that was supposed to be destroying the freedom of the press?
What??? The man behind a Coup Attempt on @realDonaldTrump should not only not have clearance, he should be in jail for Treason!
@realDonaldTrump remember money and power creates a black hole in some peoples hearts where that cant ever fill there need to tear other people down , they will never be able to fill that dark hate that lives in some people . IN GOD WE TRUST . ROMANS 3:23
@GovMurphy there are 100 homes ruined in the flood in Brick NJ We the people of NJ DEMAND you take your 2 million dollar illegal defense fund and give it to those Senior citizens who lost everything @realDonaldTrump your #fema told these people to take a hike HELP THE SENIORS
So with your way of thinking because @realDonaldTrump isn't a saint, he's not qualified to have your respect. Let's name some people of great character, Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, should I go on or do those suffice?
#FreePress Disappointing. This is no different from @realDonaldTrump excluding the press.
@realDonaldTrump scapegoating DC, I note that Moody's upgraded its GO bond rating to Aaa: "The upgrade to the general obligation rating reflects continued strengthening of the District's economy, finances and overall credit profile, propelling it into the top rating category. "

@realDonaldTrump has committed crimes. His family and his friends have committed crimes. The circle of people surrounding him that have committed crimes keeps growing. This is why telling the truth and defending law & order is the biggest offense to him. #Impeach45

@realDonaldTrump You're a DISGRACE to America! The continued killing of innocent men women and children by #SaudiArabia in #Yemen are on your hands #Trump . Over 200 innocent people have been killed because you decided to sell certain weapons to Saudi Arabia. @SaudiEmbassyUSA
. @realDonaldTrump Transforming those lost farming jobs into new manufacturing jobs would be a smart transition. Also industry treads as to where future jobs will be due to AI & robotics would be great for the US #workforcedevelopment to position itself for the jobs of the future.
@realDonaldTrump running scared?
Has anyone noticed that anyone who has worked or is working for @realDonaldTrump has become a world wide joke! It's true, you can't make this stuff up!
Of all the shit endorsements @realDonaldTrump has peddled why not skin care products? Sex it up with some marketable color names like Bone Mayo, Hazmat Orange and 3-Cheese Umber.
Just through the traitor in jail and make a good example out of her. She's running around thinking her don't stink while disrespecting @POTUS . She signed a NDA which is a legal contract and she breached it. Take her down NOW! @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump
