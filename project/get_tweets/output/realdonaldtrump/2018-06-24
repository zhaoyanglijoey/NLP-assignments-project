@realDonaldTrump Brought to you by a @usairforce reject, who without having a Marines office nearby, got recruited for Life, Live frugally... We have the means for everyone, you don't need slavery with automation. Just ingenuity, u got a task, Pres. Don, Build. It's like autocad. pic.twitter.com/OZSzsanKeR
@realDonaldTrump me me me...its all about me...you poor whittle whiny brat... #FatNixon
My understanding is that @realDonaldTrump may sign an executive order extending @SecretService protection to other individuals. Why not Cabinet secretaries? Surely that would open up incitement calls to investigation.

@realDonaldTrump please set the record straight on the kids being sent here that are not with parents.. Spread the story of what these kids go through
If you don't like it, too, too bad.There's no better way to let @SarahHuckabee , so-called @GovMikeHuckabee , @realDonaldTrump and the KLAN realize they don't speak FOR Americans, nor TO the majority of Americans. They speak for the pigs they are! They should find troughs. @JoeNBC
You can't fight @realDonaldTrump with weakness, you have to attack him like he attacks everyone. Unfortunately, that goes for his Lying staff as well.
2016 Votes for Trump 66 million, GDP Over 3%, @GovMikeHuckabee calling DonnyDeutsch Mr Douche on Fox and Friends-Priceless. @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @greggutfeld @foxandfriends @FoxNews @PressSec
Distract, Deny, Distort ......yeah, that be @realDonaldTrump

Other than David Duke @realDonaldTrump is the most popular president among Nazis and white nationalists in modern times at this point.

@realDonaldTrump Why can't we just load them into a plane and return them to wherever they came from?
It is totally heart breaking. @realDonaldTrump has supported and cultivated hatred in our country. I am running out of pejorative adjectives to describe him. Nothing is more important than voicing resistance and voting in 2018!
@realDonaldTrump Why are you not getting list of men who i paid for their sex??????????????why get them please they are the ones fighting you rep. Your core.
Any time a @realDonaldTrump staff member is seen in a restaurant, the @WHO should be called for immediate catch and removal. They are a health hazard for the entire world!
Today would be a great day for @realDonaldTrump to resign.
@funder I have a question... is there a Democrat that can stand up and beat @realDonaldTrump in 2020?
@realDonaldTrump Don't let one, single person through! Do not budge on ZERO TOLERANCE! FIRST!
That has aggravated me since @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has taken office.

@realDonaldTrump FUCK U
What are the odds that @realDonaldTrump will erroneously tweet about how Tropical Storm Daniel is fake news?
I know I'm going out on a limb here, but I don't think @realDonaldTrump can take a joke.
And yet you voted for @realDonaldTrump budget which increased the military budget, tax breaks for the 1%, and a spending budget which also increased the deficit. #wheresyouroutrage #GOPTaxScam #Budget2018
Great job @RealCandaceO ... next you need to organize a conservative form in the @WhiteHouse with @realDonaldTrump
People loved Obama. Trump is jealous. He will never be even 1% as good. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, hear you're thinking about stopping and turning around illegals at the Border, like Nike said: Just Do It! Sincerely, respectfully, USMC 66-72
@therealroseanne did @realDonaldTrump have your kids thrown in cages then send them across country to who knows where to likely never be reuinted with you? No? You lost a job for being a racist. That's not losing everything. What gall you have to act as a victim.
@realDonaldTrump Your doing a great job keep up the good work

@realDonaldTeump praises strong men for two reasons. First he sees in them what is missing from him, strength. Second he has always surrounded himself with criminals. @realDonaldTrump is the biggest weakling in the world. He is a man-child. He is ignorant beyond belief.
@realDonaldTrump Please get judge who was given folder on you Hillary pd $17M for lies fisc this judge believed it without a little checking. Get his name published we want to know who he is and who signed lies
Good for them if it was against their religion or core beliefs lol this is where @realDonaldTrump @VP have is heading.
BTW, take out CA and Trump won the majority by over 1 mil. Take out NY and @realDonaldTrump won by almost 4 mil. This is why we have electoral voting. It's the, "United States". CA and NY do not dictate the presidency.
As it should. @realDonaldTrump
Just remember @realDonaldTrump is YOUR President to who is doing an AWESOME JOB!! And there is nothing you can do about it!!
Oh @SenBobCorker ... how about Mr Sessions, Steven Miller, K. Nielsen, @realDonaldTrump , nearly all of the WH with exception of @FLOTUS & @IvankaTrump .
I believe this is called "inciting a riot." The police, DOJ, @jeffsessions , @realDonaldTrump had better get a handle on this. It just takes one spark... these communists are getting emboldened because there are no repurcussions to their actions. Not good.
@realDonaldTrump I agree You must build the wall and beef up security where it can't go
@realDonaldTrump Donnie You have traits that run parallel in your twisted head: Willful Ignorance Racism Constant LYING Conning/Defrauding regardless of impact Sexist - that's just to START the list Each of them bad in their own way Each of them a CHOICE
@potus @realDonaldTrump You are no patriot

@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Google Dmitri Alperovitch & Crowd Strike,Google gave em 100 mill & Google CEO started "The Groundwork" for HRC. You see a connection yet? All their support for DNC hack is a fraud, even the previous FBI agent Shawn Henry @Crowd Strike
@KasieDC @realDonaldTrump likes the dictators because they can bribe him. Leaders from western democracies will not and cannot. That is the real reason behind his dictator lovefest.
Not if it was against their religion or core beliefs lol this is where @realDonaldTrump @VP have is heading.
. @realDonaldTrump I no longer feel like America is special or am proud to be an American. You've destroyed that. Thank you, you piece of shit. YOU and the GOP did it.
Democrat politicians are selling out America and its citizens to FOREIGN COUNTRIES!!!! WTF? The party has just destroyed itself... #maga @realDonaldTrump @MaxineWaters
@realDonaldTrump every time I see you on television I'm reminded of what traitor you are to this country. You are trash. And the only comfort I get is knowing that you have destroyed your family name and will go down in history as the worst president the US has ever seen. Nite.
Whatever @realDonaldTrump called #Nazis "decent people" and incited violence at his Klan #MAGA rallies, silence. The @GOP sided with hate groups and bigots over the rest of us. As a vet, I've been disappointed in your dad since he gave us @SarahPalinUSA . #VeteransAgainstTrump

Shows the relationship between @realDonaldTrump and those parents is solid. Liberals will combust in 3...2...1...
@FLOTUS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump So the coat? Explain your reason 4 the message on the coat visiting the children. We need clarity. It was viewed as a horrible message. Is this how you promote your Brand. Creating diversion & controversy.Did POTUS force u 2 wear it?
Sick minded people. Need re-wiring their brains. Thisbwas/is part of the NWO/Agenda 2030. Where sexual deviants would rule the earth. Thank Heaven for @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

THE TRUMP EFFECT Expose PAST failures of governments, politicians and people. Acknowledge PRESENT shortcomings. Embrace a new FUTURE for prosperity and change. Thank you @realDonaldTrump
In regards to the refugees & your evil policy, @realDonaldTrump & his supporters: Real Christians know that this is not an issue of politics but of right & wrong. Proverbs 4:27 Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.

Quote-unsure of attribution- Civility is the cowards favorite virtue. First it was mocking disabled, insulting POW's, mocking cancer victims and separating brown families. Caging children does not represent American values. Silence is complicity. @GOP @realDonaldTrump #WeSeeYou

Disgusting. The worse they act, the more they dig their own graves. The silent majority of Americans stand behind @realDonaldTrump and all the people who work under his administration. Recent actions by crazies seems to be the desperate acts of losers.
The biggest pain we have is @GOP and @realdonaldtrump destroying the principles that Made America Already Great.
President Trump @realDonaldTrump is the best!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I thought that our constitutional rights were for US citizens. I found out today, that "due process" is there for illegals as WELL!! BUILD THAT WALL SIR, PLEASE!!!!
