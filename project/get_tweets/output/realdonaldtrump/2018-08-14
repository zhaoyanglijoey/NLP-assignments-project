How can one dog call another a dog? @realDonaldTrump
Magnitude of outcome of KevinYoder-Dumala love affair, inclusion of HR392 in DHS Bill, is no less than impact of Russian spies to affect their own agenda @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions @DHSgov @USCIS @TuckerCarlson @DanaPerino @KatiePavlich @newtgingrich @RulesReps @Dawnnewyorker pic.twitter.com/4ZaNNIUXqr
@realDonaldTrump just so you know it is Senator John McCain's bill. You know an American hero......don't forget this bill is not to your credit. It's is his bill.
. @realDonaldTrump all the money in the world won't buy you class, honesty, love, intelligence. You're putting on the greatest clown show in history. It's time to move on, the jokes are old, the gig is up. Pack you're soap for prison, the ride is over.
Interesting that not a single person has ever said @realDonaldTrump uses racist language or is racist... yet the dog trying to sell a crap book insisting on it? Give me a break
In what world is it ok to call someone a dog? @realDonaldTrump enlighten me.
@realDonaldTrump i dont drink Sam Adam's but I may have to start!!
What happened to being "proud" and salivating over #IdiotPOTUS @realDonaldTrump ? Asking for a friend.
@realDonaldTrump is a dog. He's a dachshund for that matter.
https:// youtu.be/ezOsfQupbSM @CNN @MSNBC @iamjamiefoxx CHECK IT OUT YA'LL KEEP SAYING THOUGHT I SHOULD JUST PLAY IT I CREATED A MONSTER LOL @OMAROSA @realDonaldTrump

@FoxNews does the same thing. Just depends on which shift is working. John Roberts blocked me because I called him out. Fox has about 3 or 4 shows worth watching now if you support @realDonaldTrump .
Is that from too much tanning or too much alcohol and cocaine? @realDonaldTrump @potus @gop @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC
@FoxNews @TheStoryFNC It is time to retire @GeraldoRivera !! Just pure hot air, creating more chaos for White House saying not enough blacks!! He calls himself a friend of @realDonaldTrump , and throws him under bus just like Omarosa did!
Of course @realDonaldTrump is a racist.There's no magic threshold he will reach if we hear him say it on tape.Any black person over age 2 has sensory perception that easily detects racist behavior & tendencies.Trump brazenly exercises his racism-no mystery. @cspanwj @MSNBC
Guess you aren't smart enough to understand @realDonaldTrump comment.. but that's ok.. @OMAROSA is a #LowlifeOmarosa #UnAmerican #POS
@realDonaldTrump shouldn't hire people for the White House because they beg or cry. He should hire them because they can do the job. Trump shouldn't be too surprised that the @OMAROSA hire ended in mess.

Great....so now @realDonaldTrump is insulting dogs?
@realDonaldTrump What kind of POTUS calls people names? Calls a woman a dog?? You sicken me. #ResignNow You are the biggest bully I have ever seen and I am ashamed of you. #Notmypresident
Hahahahahahahaha Ya broke the irony meter @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/lWAP5A9OnA
How about leaving it up until Alex Jones is gone and @realDonaldTrump is suspended for calling a woman a dog and other personal insults?
#realDonaldTrump referred to Lil'John as uncle tom. @realDonaldTrump #FuckYouDonald !!!! #NotMyPresident https:// youtu.be/--rAGBoE5Y0

@realDonaldTrump Just so you know, your tweet storms are like a guide for "How To Look Like A Very Guilty Man," and also, you kind of come off as an idiot because you get the facts wrong. Do yourself a favor and resign.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Tonight's #QuoteOfTheDay is from our great President Donald Trump. #MAGA #TrumpTrain #Dobbs pic.twitter.com/IPwipVioMf
@realDonaldTrump Being the POTUS makes it mandatory to NOT be prejudiced toward American citizens or OUR FREE PRESS. You are attempting to take down America, and Don, I for one truly wish you nothing but misfortune, and I hope your KINGSHIP ends in the very near future!!!
We know this because @realDonaldTrump admitted to sexually assaulting women and we all heard the tape.
But it won't matter to his base as they too are racists. Bottom line, the MAJORITY of Americans who voted CHOSE @HillaryClinton . The 70,000 votes that resulted in Trump's Electoral College win are SUSPECT to say the least. In any case, @realDonaldTrump is a DANGER to democracy
Hopefully @realDonaldTrump gets the #IRS on this
Fuck you @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @cnn @msnbc @foxnews RED ALERT RED ALERT WE ARE GOING TO CALL OUT @MSNBC AND @CNN FOR LYING BALD FACE LYING TO THIS WAS NOT THE OLNY TWEET WHERE HE CALLED SOMEONE A DOG. THERE IS 4 OTHER TWEETS.
U have to look USA president first! If u r talking about arrogance and stupidity! @realDonaldTrump and miserable followers believes that #usa has the right of Managing all countries however they want! Your time is up man! Balance is changing and u r not superpower of new era!
@Rasmussen_Poll @realDonaldTrump You and your racist party are the oppressors.The 1% is doing very well though.
LOL at people who need a tape as proof that @realDonaldTrump is a racist.

Unless I misunderstand something, when @realDonaldTrump signed the bill it became a law which binds him to comply.
I joined Twitter 3 years ago and have been loyal to America and @realDonaldTrump 100% and continue to be. @s8n is weak in my house dedicated to GOD/FAMILY/COUNTRY. Millions share my view. #WWG1WGA #Freedom #GreatAwakening
1/ Every man wants to be set up with a partner by a thrice married, multi-hyphenate accused criminal (sexual assault-pedophilia, fraud-treason-conspiracy) who calls women dogs ( @realDonaldTrump We know you meant bitch.) and men SOBs.
#QAnon post No. 1873... @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Along the lines of an #AgentProvocateur or at least #WeaponizedMedia twisting facts / truths - think #HooverDam ...

@realDonaldTrump U are our president
The only mutt I see is @realDonaldTrump
Someone needs to teach @realDonaldTrump that "witch hunt" doesn't mean "investigation into traitorous criminals who absolutely committed crimes" and someone else needs to teach @Amy_Siskind that "smear campaign" doesn't mean "posting real things you said less than 10 years ago."
@voteashleymoody is "endorsed by @AGPamBondi " and "stands with @realDonaldTrump ". Those are the 2 best reasons NOT to vote for her. #BlueWave2018
I think we should make #MoralMonsters trend with any tweet from @realDonaldTrump or tRump enabler.
#Omorosa When you wanted to keep detesting someone who for a decade seemed wholly shallow, enabling and mean, but you start feeling like she is the one person who can bring down the stain on America that is @realDonaldTrump .
@realDonaldTrump stop responding to Omarosa and let us Patriots handle your light work. Please
If @realDonaldTrump really wants to be popular with the greatest amounts of Americans - known as The Greatest President Ever - he should champion universal healthcare. Such a move would stand the test of time. Really he should think about it.
Sir, @realDonaldTrump This stuff raises issues of fraud In the inducement and duress. Ask your lawyers. You might want to provide everyone copies of all of the documents at a minimum. My, you are the sneaky one.

If there's a tape of @realDonaldTrump saying the "N" word, will it effect the upcoming midterm elections? Check out my analysis on @cbs46 News. #CBS46 #WAOK #V103 #RealTalk #RashadRichey #PoliticalAnalyst #OMAROSA https:// youtu.be/5hXrkJ0Qm34
While I support the @realDonaldTrump POTUS, I feel he owes dogs an apology for besmirching their reputation as loyal, true and loving companions by comparing them to a disloyal and underhanded piece of disloyal trash like @OMAROSA .
@MarkSimoneNY "YOU FIRST" i loved your reply with @LouDobbs BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY TRUE. we do need JUSTICE restored @realDonaldTrump LETS take care of the corruption NEXT @FBI and @TheJusticeDept must be REBUILD from ZERO pic.twitter.com/2tpVqk0GjH
Katrina Pierson is an advocate for liars, thieves, and sexual predators. @KatrinaPierson is an advocate for sexual violence against women. She defends @realDonaldTrump who has admitted to sexual assault and to wanting to have sex with his own daughter. Katrina Pierson is a FRAUD
Reminder, @alicetweet 's a #DeplorableWhyteWoman who supports #Racist #Misogynistic #Bigot & #BaldFacedLiar @realDonaldTrump ; she values @GOP over #BasicMorals & wants her #WhyteWomaness to be revered over #Minorities & #Equality , she's #DestroyingUS b/c she loves #WhytePrivilege .
Sarah, what pet animal name will @realDonaldTrump have for you when the inevitable fall-from-position happens to you?
@realDonaldTrump as usual Trump has to resort to a CDA to try and shut Omarosa down. Just disgusting that everything he does is so corrupt he needs a CDA for everything. FU Trump
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @donlemon @NancyPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @IngrahamAngle @ChrisCuomo @morningmika @larryelder @JudgeJeanine @brianstelter @PressSec Finally Jim Acosta will keep his mouth shut at all White House Press Conference.Good News for Sara Sanders pic.twitter.com/6tqPUvhviM
@realDonaldTrump is not only a racist, he's an opportunist who happens to know how to move the people who hated @BarackObama and diversity. Calling him racist makes him more popular among that group, his base. Unfortunately, this is where we are, I don't want to hear it. VOTE!
Do you think @realDonaldTrump @POTUS will leave the Whitehouse when he is #impeached or voted out?
Jim Acosta would still be shouting questions @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump What's up with ppl turning up dead every time they are going to testify against the Clinton Crime Family??
either that or he REALLY likes guardians of the galaxy... cause same @realDonaldTrump
@realdonaldtrump How could you NOT recognize Sen.McCain, Chairman-Senate Armed Services Comm. & named for the bill, John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act. It was childish, especially in the face of the challenges @SenJohnMcCain is facing. You, sir, are a sick person.

It's funny watching you losing it, as the LAW, and Bobby III Sticks, closes in, @realDonaldTrump ! It's that same desperation of a coward, that you displayed when dodging the draft! #CowardInChief #TrumpColluded #TrumpTreason #TrumpIsARacist
Today @realDonaldTrump I urge all to see blackkklansman .. it depicts where we are headed in trumps America. We must vote the son of a bitch and all his white suprenacists out of office. #fucktrumpbeforehefucksyou
@realDonaldTrump We have terriorist group In U.S. now. Where the hell is the sorry AG? Fire him now!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS When will U fire sessyuns rodensteen & wary? These people are incompetent & inane criminals Please mr president protect the good citizens of America Fire sessyuns rodensteen & wary today PLEASE!
@realDonaldTrump does not care he is too busy fighting with Omarosa to be bothered by the death of Americans or any problems other than what hurts his weak ego
Then you haven't read enuf of his tweets. @realDonaldTrump knows she was smart, witty, out conned him. This was all he could do to get back. He's the ultimate low life. Money can't buy real low life character, class, intelligence.
I'm so much looking forward to your thoughtful & well reasoned information on what the great @realDonaldTrump is doing & will do for #America . Thank you Katrina you are the best. Stay strong girl you're on the right side of history. #Spygate #ObamaGate #Trump2020 #MAGA

Democrats have to be shaking in their boots. They know they can't win if @realDonaldTrump gets 30% of the black vote.
Die @realDonaldTrump
Is Obama obliged to pay back the miss used tax dollars or is this going to be excused? @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @RepMattGaetz @RandPaul @newtgingrich @JudgeJeanine @seanhannity @BarackObama
If @realDonaldTrump has done anything positive for America, it's in uniting ~70% of us in being revolted by his behavior and the cowardice of the @GOP . He's damaged the #GOP beyond repair, leaving no legitimate conservative party for a generation. Whatever trumps touches, dies.
And a song dedicated to you young man. @realDonaldTrump #IdiotPOTUS https:// youtu.be/rWb4BJx6pUQ
Thank #God her mother, @HillaryClinton , lost the election. We were truly spared from people like @ChelseaClinton , other leftists, and the Muslim Brotherhood having influence on the WH. Thank you, #God , for @realDonaldTrump 's victory. #BlackAmericansforTrump @Barbarafmharlem
I love dogs, I would never call that vindictive ugly hateful woman a dog ever. That is a horrid insult to a dog. Sad that @realDonaldTrump would insult a dog that much, I am sure the dog will love him.

@realDonaldTrump demented fukwad
Pretty much every tweet I write probably violates the fucking terms of service somehow but they seek to pick and choose when to enforce it. And they seem to allow @realDonaldTrump and his nazi cult to do and say any crazy shit they want.

I love it. @realDonaldTrump took the words right out of my mouth.
@realDonaldTrump Justice will be served. You will, one day, fall at the feet of President Obama begging for forgiveness for your sins, starting from Birther LIE! We pray for you to then PERISH in a ball of fire & fury like this world has never seen before!!
Americans should stop wishing' and hopin' that @realDonaldTrump would simply go away He was duly elected to the office in the full knowledge of his beliefs and values. Focus on the next election, and VOTE him out.
@realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @DNC Keith Ellison: Warm, loving & caring D leader? Possible serial abuser of women? Better choose wisely or all your anti-R rhetoric may get flushed for hypocrisy.
Well, at least we know how @realDonaldTrump got @MarkBurnettTV to get in bed with him.
. @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP See attached post. This must stop.
@realDonaldTrump is having some serious meltdowns on Twitter. He's scared of something. Attacking others to divert attention away from his activities. Don't look away folks, keep your eyes on his tiny hands, he's trying to pull fast ones. ConmanDon.
