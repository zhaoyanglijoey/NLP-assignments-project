@DNC Laughing at the DNC sending out giant postcards against Conservative candidates to the 3 WOMEN Republican voters in our household. Odd the men didn't get them. But keep spending your money...it's fun to tear them up. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #TRUMP2020 #KAG #VoteRed
@realDonaldTrump I am very concerned about our education systems and the direction they have taken. Free speech, independence and a melting pot of thoughts should always be at our core.
So @realDonaldTrump was right all along. Imagine that.
If my 88 year old grandpa can learn to use his S7 and learn how to tip 20%, you can learn not to be an asshole @realDonaldTrump #IBelieveHer #Herstory
It's true, @realDonaldTrump is winning all over.. Most campaign aides and admin officials to be felons first 2 yrs, 1st president to be a Russian asset, least popular in history, tax cheat, conspirator against the US, lover of murderous dictators, enemy to our allies #Winning
@GeorgeWBush__ became President through the shenanigans orchestrated by the Supreme Court and had 2 Supreme Court appointments. Now @realDonaldTrump gets into WH with Russian help and gets 2 SC openings. RIGGED #VoteBlue2018
they are keeping the rabble they are supposed to represent out.. b/c . @GOP is no longer interested in rabble;they want to line their own pockets at the expense of the rabble.Donald J Trump is teaching them to do as his father taught him. . @realDonaldTrump . @nytimes . @PreetBharara

Trump himself seems to have sensed he was losing the crowd so he called up the MN GOP Senatorial candidate. She promptly admonishes @realDonaldTrump from the podium for saying her opponents name, Tina Smith, way more than her name. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump If you have any protesters please invite them up to speak and a have a civil debate
Cant help but wonder if there was something "in addition to" the FBI report in the SCIF. That would be so @realDonaldTrump DROP THE HAMMER

I'm too old for abortion, have a good career, retirement is growing, no kids in school, good gun laws in my state yet I feel like crap about what's going on...little of it effects me, but my heart is broken for Dr. Ford. I have something @realDonaldTrump doesn't - empathy.
I keep pinching myself becsuse @LindseyGrahamSC is en fuego. @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EvanOnstot @benshapiro @marklevinshow @EWErickson
@realDonaldTrump
Well if thats the case then maybe @realDonaldTrump will declassify, so the We The People can see for ourselves bc you know we don't believe a God darn thing that you or your other Senators say. You are not leaders, you are Representatives & that can change fast. #DeclassifyNow
You didn't listen to @realDonaldTrump make a speech did you? I know that makes me violently ill
@Alyssa_Milano Thank you for fighting the good fight! #SAD #BABY #LOSER @realDonaldTrump knows he NEEDS #LyingKavanaugh to not be indicted! #StopKavanaugh

Panic Mode! Wait until @realDonaldTrump flips #SCOTUS 6-3!
@HatchingChange I will give you credit in the manner in which you wrote your letter to @realDonaldTrump . You told your horrible gruesome story without attacking the President, without the hatred & vitriol of most liberals.
Yes and it was ignored by the @FBI under orders by McGahn via @realDonaldTrump .
Who? @realDonaldTrump future ex wife?
@usdemocrats @DNC @nytimes All independents, time to take inventory of Bernie Sanders! @realDonaldTrump How many homes does Bernie own?! @uvmvermont How did his wife, who is under federal indictments, escape the main stream media acknowledgement?! She is guilty of fraud
@realDonaldTrump Monica Samille Lewinsky should not permit to touch any kinds of Government powers.She should live like a normal people.400000000 American people have no senses to help Clinton clean his underwear.And his former one probably just is a member of his corrupted team.
@realDonaldTrump Get your facts straight, you lying cuss.
Fitness to serve. @realDonaldTrump lacks this. #Kavanaugh lacks this. Not surprising @realDonaldTrump picked Kavanaugh to keep him out of prison.
When #Kavanaugh is confirmed the meltdowns will be epic! They will rival @realDonaldTrump inauguration flurrmageddon #ConfirmKavanaughNow #RedTsunami #MAGA #BlueWave #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease
@realDonaldTrump Since when does Minnesota love Trump?

@realDonaldTrump I would like to know why those we elect have the right to give raises to themselves and others in government I for one have seen a bunch of no good sorry asses that do nothing but hold this country back but yet they think they and their friends deserve more
Why not just move to someplace better? @realDonaldTrump #maga
Oops look a back track/ apology @realDonaldTrump is not going to like that !!! and we don't believe you If you're explaining you're losing LOL

@realDonaldTrump If Brett is not confirmed by some horrendous twist of fate I will lose faith in our justice system and hopes he joins a huge law firm and his goal is to sue everyone who slandered his good name and his family! Especially Dems who desecrated him with no proof.
@realDonaldTrump Fox News Won't let us hear the Ralley! We want to hear Trump!

Welcome Mr. President @realDonaldTrump
God knows there are better conservative options for SCOTUS, that's my only point. My concern is that @realDonaldTrump wants #Kavanaugh as SCOTUS for #RussianCollusion self-interest.
What about the country. This guy is a partisan hack sworn in to protect @realDonaldTrump at all costs. Also will be protecting the rotten GOP. I hope he gets his ass impeached. What a piece of shit. I feel sorry for his complicit wife and daughters.
Hey U.K., answer 1 question: WHY were you begging @realDonaldTrump NOT to Declassify the FISA Docs? WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES DEMAND TRUTH & OUR DULY ELECTED @POTUS WILL GIVE THAT TRUTH TO HIS PEOPLE ! WE see you & your corruption! We are cleaning up the Cabal WW! #QAnon

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President (Don't get yourself in any trouble) But wouldn't it be great, to get the word to the people. If any Democrat Senator votes against Judge Kavanaugh and is up for re-election in November, the people will vote them out of their seat.
