One of @realDonaldTrump best decisions was to put @PressSec in her position.
You're right. We'll see what exactly @BarackObama , @HillaryClinton , and @realDonaldTrump actually receive when the smoke clears.

@MittRomney on the telephone with @realDonaldTrump "Hay, Donald we took your hotel from you, but we are thinking of naming a Utah highway after you. A lot of Utahans will be driving over you for years to come!" Romneys run over everyone, they will be taking more from Trump.
Thank the Lord the Democrats voted against Trumps Amnesty for illegal aliens! If it had passed, @realDonaldTrump would have delivered a permanent death blow to Republicans, Christians, conservatives, Constitutionalists, and all American non-socialists.

I believe the dems dont want to fix daca & turned down @realDonaldTrump deal that would've provided more than ever with path to citizenship so they could use the issue for campaigning. Its so obvious. @potus called the dem's bluff #DACA

Words can shoot people and nuke cities? Wow... what a cop out. And having a non military militia is illegal. The only people who do it are generally rednecks worried 'bout the government taking over. It couldn't happen nowadays. Unless you count @realDonaldTrump ...
@realDonaldTrump looks like the swamp is selling you out !
@realDonaldTrump If you & Mr. Trump watched the real news, you would know the answer to this questions. It has been answered thoroughly, completely and convincingly. The FBI knew Russia was interfering with the election; then they discovered ties with Trump campaign. Stay tuned!
@realDonaldTrump and the whole lot are hypocrites in the first degree! But, they don't care, because they have no respect for our country or our laws! No doubt about either!
@realDonaldTrump , @jeffsessions , @TGowdySC @mattgaetz What can be done to forcibly bring Christopher Steele to US to testify under oath ?

So what does this make @realDonaldTrump and his bone spurs?
Amazing that nepotism which is frowned upon by big business (bc it has the appearance of impropriety) isn't a big deal in the Federal Gov't. @realDonaldTrump is giving money away to his @IvankaTrump (daughter? Employee? depends on the day/reporter) & so is senators.
Would you explain why you tagged those people??? Curious @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PamBondi
"two accomplished young people who only want the best for @realDonaldTrump & the country" - There is no evidence for these claims Mr. Rivera.

@AriMelber I have never seen anything on TV like your show tonight. You & your panelists were brilliant, calm. I feel like #SamNunberg lost his mind publicly. I was sad watching him. What did the U.S. do to deserve this circus that @realDonaldTrump brought upon us?
This kind of thing may not be surprising to us after all of the crap @realDonaldTrump has pulled in the past, but it's scary that we are normalizing this type of blatant disregard of the Constitution and laws of the land! We Need to end this Insanity Now!!!

Hey, Geraldo-- @realDonaldTrump hired those snitches, vipers, & rats (& has to fire many of them for being incompetent, racist, foreign agents, or wife beaters). Also, the rumor is Trump himself wants Ivanka & Jared out of the WH because of their questionable/unethical biz ties.
Maybe he has a peculiar delusion that @realDonaldTrump can peremptorily get him off the hook, or "pardon" him (for what?). I wonder if he's on the phone with Chee-to as we tweet screaming at him to fire Mueller. If Trump tries to defend Nunberg, a political OK Corral may ensue.
