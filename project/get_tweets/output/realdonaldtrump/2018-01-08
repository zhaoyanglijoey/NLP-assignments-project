Okay, let me be the first to say it: IMPEACH @Oprah ! @teriobrien @WVON1690 @THR @Rosie @donlemon @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne @robreiner @chuckwoolery @MarkDice @maddow @wcpt820 @WalshFreedom @rushlimbaugh @benshapiro #NOprah
@realDonaldTrump
She would beat @realDonaldTrump like a drum
@THEHermanCain @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle WHAT A HORRIBLE MESSAGE. Not going to be potus...any number.
@realDonaldTrump I have "Executive Time" built into my schedule too. They're called naps.
Only because she's black & a female. Remember when @realDonaldTrump was criticized for not having any political experience. Remember when @POTUS was criticized for having a conflict of interest b/c of his business empire? #DoubleStandards
WATCH: Senator @JeffFlake Goes On Offensive To Secure DACA/Dreamers Resolution; Will Be Meeting At White House Tomorrow, @realDonaldTrump Has "Instincts (that) are better than some of the advice he gets" http:// bit.ly/AZp1519 #DACA #DACADeal pic.twitter.com/Dh33sFPAPq
@brittmazz we should invite @realDonaldTrump to our wedding so I can wear this! pic.twitter.com/CU2jejxqW4
8) ivwant a strong, action-oriented leader who will create an environment that eveyday Americans can thrive in. And its crystal clear to me we're at the beginning of a huge boom thanks to the business-friendly policies he has put in place. Thats is why I support @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump It is because of President Obama that the economy is so great, not you. Your fantasies are not reality, no matter how much you with that they were. Fox News is a format for those based in fantasy! They are all going to turn on you at once Donald!
So @realDonaldTrump promised #Mexico would pay for the wall and his trolls ate it up. Now #Trump says that unless the American tax payers foot the bill he'll shut down our government? Does that sound like #MAGA ? @VicenteFoxQue told us Mexico wasn't paying for that fucking wall!
Sneeze like @realDonaldTrump is standing in front of you.
@realDonaldTrump doesn't have the stamina to keep up with a 70 year old woman.
Although I do follow politics I normally don't comment, but today this is not the case. @realDonaldTrump revoked TPS and basically told 200,000 Salvadorians with legal status that they must leave our country. Some of which are my family. With all sincerity Mr. Trump FUCK YOU
@GOPChairwoman Is anyody a bit disturbed that @realDonaldTrump keeps referring to Ronald Reagan when he speaks of his own mental health? Reagan had Alzheimer's. Trump shows the signs: repetitive, behavioral, disturbed, delusional, poor sleeping patrons, lack sound judgment. pic.twitter.com/LHAcJsdjD1
lol Not a chance, @realDonaldTrump would crush her !!!!
if @Oprah runs for Prez, will she be running as an experienced chat show host? Hahahahah Great background to run for office Typical of lefties cheering a celebrity Remember @realDonaldTrump was an established bussiness man Before he was a celb
Number of days since @realDonaldTrump has threatened the world with nuclear war: 6
MS 13 originates in El Salvador 1/3 of MS 13 caught in United States came here as dreamers dreamers are not the innocents they make them out to be only 900 of 800k are in the military do not buy that they are patriotic and here for anything more than a handout @realDonaldTrump

I don't think USA has ever had a President who was more considerate of consequences than @realDonaldTRump has #MAGA Love & hugs to you and Melania
@realDonaldTrump deliver this:
@realDonaldTrump cannot serve the country. He serves himself only.
We need to get rid of @realDonaldTrump NOW! Then, only then, can we get serious about 2020. If @Oprah is serious about 2020, she needs to help us get rid of Trump now. #ImpeachTrump @cnnbrk @cnni @OWNTV @FoxNews @nytimes @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
I read #FireandFury . And guess what? It's NOT a book about @realDonaldTrump ... https:// buff.ly/2CJBb3K pic.twitter.com/1wqbQFFCCX
So @realDonaldTrump is at the football game tonight and @kendricklamar is singing at halftime. Now that's Poetic Justice. Did you see what I did there? Kendrick fans will know.
If the DOJ has stated that @realDonaldTrump 's tweets are official statements, but he blocks individual Twitter users he doesn't like, does that mean they can say he truly isn't their President? Lucky ducks.
Why isn't there public hearings on.this??? https://t.co/E9rO4gD1cD?amp=1 @DevinNunes @ChuckGrassley @RepGoodlatte @mattgaetz @Jim_Jordan @SteveKingIA @RandPaul @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump
#FakeNews typical left media; always someone else to blame like Pres. Obama & HClinton did for 8 years and counting. The lux of lying, blaming, & not taking responsibility. In the USA I know U would all be fired. That is why @realDonaldTrump will win again despite your fake news
@realDonaldTrump where is your support for the El chapo act to fund the wall rather than negotiate with democrats for taxpayer money??? Where are you @seanhannity @LouDobbs @BretBaier @tedcruz Let's get it done.
He's even ruined golf,the gentleman's game, the game of fathers and sons. He's ruined it with his shameless cheating and money grubbing user ways. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #poorBaron @PGATOUR
@realDonaldTrump Anyway you can have the IRS have a box for donations for the building of the Wall on next years taxes? By the way You're doing a Great Job at Making America Great Again!
Hello, Mr. Trump, I volunteer to take down the dwarf from the rockets of a headshoot. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump , please no deal on #DACA . Make them get in line like everyone else who wants in legally. Fair is fair. How is it right for their parents to break law, yet they get a pass? #BuildTheWall
@realDonaldTrump Thank You Mr. President. Hell Yeah!!!!! I Love You Dude. You're a great President!
@realDonaldTrump yo bama or uga??????
It is very shameful as per @DNC if @realDonaldTrump is mentally unstable then he is one you lost election to How bad is the DNC mental health compared to trump?
Not quite a Gallup Poll but Pres Trump leads @OPRAH on Twitter: @realDonaldTrump - 46.3-million @Oprah - 41.2-million
Remember @realDonaldTrump even Hitler LOST. You will to a lot faster because we do learn from history and Your buddy Putin will have his day also.
Well, that's probably because YOU'RE IGNORANT and STUPID, AVATAR.... . @jahimes : @realDonaldTrump will attack 'ANYONE and EVERYONE' except Putin and Russia pic.twitter.com/08IoCV9byY
What are their most famous quotes? @realDonaldTrump : "You're fired!" @Oprah : "Everybody gets a car!" That's all you need to know... #Oprah2020
I say we deport @realDonaldTrump to North Korea!
@realDonaldTrump If you are such a genius and did NOT COLLUDE, Speak with Mueller. Donnie Huge Deals isn't a coward is he?

@realDonaldTrump heard you're at the game. Can you live tweet it please? You will guarantee my vote next Presidential election if you do.
Couldn't agree more. Although @Oprah may be an infinitely better person than @realDonaldTrump , she still may have a lot of his shortcomings. Besides, is she ready to divest herself of her empire as Trump should have?
First of all...I'd like to thank @jaketapper for ending that joke of a presidential advisor, @StephenMillerAL . His job was to make @realDonaldTrump feel better about himself and attack CNN. Trump is a chickenshit and is running scared of the Mueller Investigation...get ready!
Donald Trump is for the Legalization of Marijuana https:// youtu.be/4c-3Z604qdo via @YouTube @realDonaldTrump @potus Another Lie, since he hasn't told Jeff Sessions leave states alone that has legalized marijuana and leave it up to the states.
@UN 193 NATIONS YOU DONT NEED TO SUCK THE LOLLYPOP OF @realDonaldTrump @Plaid_DTrump @MikePenceVP HOWEVER TREAT THE NORTH AMERICAN PEOPLE N #USA NATION WITH ALL RESPECT... INFINITO LORD CREATOR. 22 54 GLOBE NEAR END...
I highly doubt @realDonaldTrump knows anything about football. #NationalChampionship
@jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump @cbs @cnn @msnbc @nytimes @nbc @abc @gop
@realDonaldTrump The scope should be limited to ANYTHING PERTAINING TO THE INVESTIGATION. Also, #WeThePeople demand that the testimony be recorded--LIKE, for posterity, you know? Trump team expects Mueller interview request @CNNPolitics http:// cnn.it/2CSUbR9
@realDonaldTrump All of these idiot left wing psychiatrists, (a term I use loosely), need to be brought up on whatever charges, or lose their licenses, based on the Goldwater rule, no matter how much they incorrectly spew that they aren't. THEY have lost THEIR minds! #MAGA
I would Never vote for @Oprah . I voted @realDonaldTrump and I'm planning to vote for him again
It is said the @WhiteHouse chef is suicidal. All @realDonaldTrump wants to eat are cheeseburgers. Every meal, every day. Such a man of refinement and culture!
@realDonaldTrump
What about @realDonaldTrump tries respecting our PEOPLE. All of them.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @AP @MSNBC @seanhannity SO THEY ALL THOUGHT DONALD WAS NOT AT ALL QUALIFIED, BUT THEY WANT OPRAH? " if I make it you can be my intern" pic.twitter.com/XDKTXMkYrL
Remember when @realDonaldTrump couldnt name one single Bible verse? And evangelicals still bought that he was Christian? Oh my #Cult45 is strong.
The South Korean delegation just crossed the DMZ for high level talk for the first time in years. I ask again about @realDonaldTrump impact.
There you go.... @realDonaldTrump ....there's the real FAKE NEWS...you imbecile! pic.twitter.com/Vq6VuRmmaz
Isn't Oprah into Scientology?? Think about the horror of that fake religion being in charge of our country. She's well spoken and people may love her....but once they know her religious beliefs, they will run. Just my opinion. @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
It's ok. Let @ricardorossello ask for all he needs to bring Puerto Rico back to prosperity. Just stop the corruptions there Mejor a Puerto Rico than Illegal Immigrants. Pero no por Independencia of the United States @CarmenYulinCruz . Socialism, Nunca @realDonaldTrump #Statehood
@realDonaldTrump If you continue your reprehensible stance on DACA, the government shutdown will be on you. It will be on you #ButtonMan . You get the blame. YOU GET ALL THE BLAME. You'd better start mucking out your stable, genius. It's all on you, you irresponsible child.

Now this explains it, from Prof. Bandy Lee's biography: "She has been teaching students studying to be public defenders and to become asylum attorneys at Yale Law School since 2003" Another Liberal Idiot who hates @realDonaldTrump and would do or say anything to hurt him! #MAGA pic.twitter.com/GAylthlvMc
The pussy grabber, @realDonaldTrump , will be riding by on his way to the #NationalChampionship , he will be in such close proximity to where I live...my blood is boiling! Too close to home.
@realDonaldTrump Pabst Smear.
Why does @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter and the rest of us have to gravel for the money for the wall when @BarackObama had no problem from Congress and MSM to give $150 billion to Iran mullahs ???? The wall needs to be fully funded no 10 yr pay out!
And an outright liar. @realDonaldTrump says he never interviewed him and was never in the oval office.
@realDonaldTrump Squre up pussy
Good-bye @realDonaldTrump .
Which cabinet post is going to be the first to tell the truth about @RealDonaldTrump 's lack of competence & mental instability? We should start a pool.
According to my newsfeed, most of you believe @Oprah will be President, right after @realDonaldTrump destroys the world in a nuclear holocaust.
. @realDonaldTrump Every day, when you first open your mouth or tweet, you prove to the world you're an idiot... always and consistently on the #firsttry . Now get back to watching the #GorillaChannel @BarackObama @GeorgeWBush_43 @BillClinton pic.twitter.com/HLaafG666Z

@realDonaldTrump denied service today at MCClellan VA because I'm a patient from Mather VA hospital. Drain the swamp Mr President and get to the VA next. I see dead people gosh
"I went to the best colleges for, (wait for it) college." quote from @potus ...Then why does @realDonaldTrump speak at an elementary level?! #TrumpsAMoron #ImpeachTrumpNow #TrumpIsUnfit #TrumpsToddlerMind
The idea of @Oprah as President may appear a pleasant thought to some, but what legislative and political experience does she have? We've already seen the result of the inexperience of @realDonaldTrump - Nice speeches don't qualify someone to run. #experiencematters #uspolitics
@realDonaldTrump who going to pick the crops the people that are willing to work the farm are being deported American don't want low paying jobs.
And this is why you will be voted out of office! Are you involved in the #Conspiracy #CORRUPTION supporting @realDonaldTrump WILL end your career!
And yes to @realDonaldTrump being a racist, sexist, hateful pos. So what does that say about the 63 million fellow Americans who voted for him despite all that?
Maybe she should have asked if he actually EVER had a One on One conversation w/ @realDonaldTrump or just happened 2C him in the hallway when pres was seeing staff members! Slander/Lies #LiberalHypocrisy #LiberalLies #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #ResistLiberalism

I hope you will find a way to get jail time taken off the table for the farmer who hired illegals. @realDonaldTrump @mitchellvii #maga
This tweet prove @realDonaldTrump has no mental capacity to lead our country.
Man - the FAKE news is ruining all the fun for the @realDonaldTrump administration.
It was not a privilege that @realDonaldTrump gave America when he ran for President. It was a curse that will haunt us for generations to come, especially if we allow it to continue to fester and infect our whole nation and its discourse.
All you ignorant deflectors trying to take the aim off what @realDonaldTrump has done. #DentureDonald is a joke of a POTUS and history will FOREVER remind us all of that fact.
