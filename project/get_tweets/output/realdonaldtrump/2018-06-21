Nope, looks to me as if he admitted to jointly creating this child smuggling ring, he should be investigated, ... just saying if you read between @realDonaldTrump syntax, which is difficult, he admits it,!! #LockHimUp
Perhaps it would #BeBest if @FLOTUS44 had a grasp of the English language & could read what was written on her jacket. Or perhaps it would #BeBest if she just admitted @realDonaldTrump is using her own #immigration status to hold her hostage as well...
