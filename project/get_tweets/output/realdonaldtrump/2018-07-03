I think @realDonaldTrump is more a combination of Voldemort, Umbridge, Lucius Malfoy, and Snape.
@realDonaldTrump @SecElaineChao @HouseGOP @VP @gianforte No govt should ever have the power and control that elds will bring. Control of all movement by @USDOT is very scary. Elds are the first step to total control, despite SCOTUS Ruling on elec tracking it continues by @FMCSA pic.twitter.com/UHubOnN6bC
Tell the truth - @realDonaldTrump cannot even name another American motorcycle company....
@realdonaldtrump wants to do away with all of those. Vote Democractic in November and stop this disgusting lunatic. That would make America great again.
@realDonaldTrump you making it harder and harder for us to get into a good college

Putin needs to give @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse new orders. Maybe he wants to show him the pee tape again
Wait ... did @realDonaldTrump just say someone else is declaring war on Law & Order?? #TwilightZoneConfirmed
I am sure it will have a rambling of how great @realDonaldTrump is because he will forget why he is there and for what purpose. As a vet, I am mortified at how little he cares for people and the Constitution.
Since @POTUS @realDonaldTrump HATES this pic so much, we should make sure it gets around again. pic.twitter.com/LOLL7F3oNS
Did @realDonaldTrump think posing like that is sexy??? He always looked like a smarmy weakling. Calling him a pussy would be an insult to women. Without $, none of his wives would have ever married that vulgar, loudmouthed MF. He's like a greasy used car salesman...yuck pic.twitter.com/XZNsTBwIyr
You have to love the quotes attributed to @realDonaldTrump . He would have benefited from the rhetoric program. @businessinsider

@realDonaldTrump No justice from @USAGSessions @TheJusticeDept . Deep state wins again by letting Awans off for treasonous crimes.
@SenBobCorker , @realDonaldTrump want to give Putin Tennessee and rename it HillySouth Oblast? Are you ok with that? Return @gop to the party of Ronald Reagan. Get rid of the fool. Make America Great Again!
Exactly what @realDonaldTrump is doing and Sneaky Snake failed to do. we heard that rhetoric from Cobra king for 8 years. People know by now never trust a snake
@NJGOP and @realDonaldTrump own this now
@realDonaldTrump asks for praise, but deserves none of it. Fred Rogers deserved praise, but asked for none of it. #TuesdayThoughts
Lying and disrespectful @realDonaldTrump has driven Canadians and even some Americans to #BuyCanadian . The president and his ridiculous message has backfired bigly. #BoycottUSA
@realDonaldTrump Go to India..... that would get the world's attention
Yes he is. Let's see @seanhannity @FoxNews @foxandfriends @TheFive @johnrobertsFox @kimguilfoyle @KellyannePolls @PressSec and of course @realDonaldTrump call him out too?
@marklutchman @realDonaldTrump UHH no one!!
@realDonaldTrump @RobertKennedyJr A country without proper socio-economic restraints becomes little more than a boxing match where the strongest groups survive to lead the country.
Light em up on @hardball @AishaMoodMills . @realDonaldTrump is bigot and a racist

@realDonaldTrump The best way to allay suspicion re: the whole Russia kerfluffle is to meet with PootiePie one on one. For. Sure.
@realDonaldTrump You are the Swamp Monster pic.twitter.com/pWVI1MapIN
@realDonaldTrump Nice photo of you and Kimmie, Don. Can hardly wait for the sexy photos of you and Putin to hit the media. Counting the days til the big event. #RESIGN pic.twitter.com/za2eupQtX4
apropos of nothing, the name "23 and me" sounds less like a genealogy company and more like the name of the picture book @realdonaldtrump is working on to lure his fourth wife.
Yes. De Niro pwns New York as @realDonaldTrump never could. Now if he'd only get over being anti-vaccine, he'd be perfect! pic.twitter.com/MoAy9Y1yuS

Hey, @realDonaldTrump - the day off is tomorrow. Your excessive tweeting will now be limited tomorrow, right?
Yeah ok. Now you want to work with @realDonaldTrump he doesn't need you or any Democrat. He is doing great.
There are three competitors to Harley-Davison: Susuki: Yamaha: Royal Enfirld (India) Is @realDonaldTrump an #unAmerican by turning his back on and destroying an American Motorcycle Company to prove a misguided point of view?
My number 2 is @lisamurkowski @jimmykimmel VPH @scarlet123x @FaceTheNation #Hollywood @HouseFloor @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney @JeffFlake
@realDonaldTrump The best American President the World has ever seen. This is coming from the U.K with heartfelt best wishes. Happy 4th July to our American friends. Stephen
No you are a negative person @realDonaldTrump ! I have never sean any one so negative towards the press then you! As that saying gose if you cant take the heat stay out of the kitchen! May i suggest you likewise!
As a person who cares deeply about the English language, @realdonaldtrump 's egregious typos and total disregard for the rules of grammar make me crazy, but it's not the particular errors that bother me....
Absolutely, the left is corrupt. For centuries they have provided shelter for criminals and even glamourized it. Sinatra came up to my face and told me straight out in '92 he killed my grandfather. Full text of the conversation has been released now. (Sorry @realDonaldTrump ).
It's coming home Donald lad @realDonaldTrump
How EXACTLY did President @realDonaldTrump FORCE Justice Kennedy to retire?
@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow knows! #Barrett #Barrett #Barrett in the class of Thomas and Gorsuch. #Barrett #AmyBarrett #AmyBarrett #Barrett #Barrett #Barrett #Barrett #Barrett #AmyBarrett #AmyBarrett #AmyBarrett #AmyBarrett Amy Barrett balance SCOTUS with conservative female
@realDonaldTrump Now that you're president, will you please stop daylight savings time - but with the summer swing in force all the time?
I support America and our military. As long as @POTUS @realDonaldTrump CONTINUES to keep his #MAGA promises, I support him. The minute he doesn't I won't. Pretty simple actually... #KAG
Stop trying to put people against the Democratic Party. Correct your actions before you point the finger Donnie. @realDonaldTrump or just grab Maxine by the pus*sy, how u handle all women
@realDonaldTrump seen my first maga shirt in public today in Weirton WV, got so excited, I'm going to try to get a picture later.
Wow @realDonaldTrump has deleted about 685 million tweets due to misspellings
I wonder if Putin will be playing the 45 rpm of "I Think We're Alone Now" by Tommy James and the Shondells in the background for mood music as Trump enters the room when they meet. @realDonaldTrump
Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump @narendramodi , Xi, and @IsraeliPM just getting on with improving prosperity for their countries
Did you even watch the video - that's a PERSON, not a #hashtag . And oh yeah, we've heard it all before - those polls showing support for @realDonaldTrump are fake... and then...but hey, peace to you. Hopefully you'll listen someday.
So its acceptable for them to go on a hunger strike for immigrants but @realDonaldTrump gets slammed for offering thoughts and prayers for shooting victims? Maybe if they were really concerned for the immigrants they would give them food money or refuge?
So... @realDonaldTrump has virtually no clue how coal works, does he?
@realDonaldTrump @VP @senategop @housegop @presssec @SCOTUS @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan tomorrow is America's birthday... however every time the SHIT HOLE opens his mouth....
