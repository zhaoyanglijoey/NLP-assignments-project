Twelve, count them TWELVE #meltdown tweets from @realDonaldTrump on a workday. Obviously, he has nothing else to do. #BobWoodward has apparently described the #Trump administration to a "T."

You are so pathetic @realDonaldTrump with your conspiracy theories, but I do agree with the fact that most of the USA and the rest of the world want you to be impeached or resign, your choice.
@realDonaldTrump I saw your tweet and heard your words........ but the Great Orange God of the Trailer Park Dwellers told us that the things we see and hear aren't real.

Well, to be fair, @realDonaldTrump was caught by surprise when Omarosa was fired, too. "You know, they run a big operation..." So, really, it impossible to say for sure. Trump just works there, he can't be aware of everything... #Resign #IdiotinChief
@realDonaldTrump I voted you in 2016. Not because you will talk about immigrant. Did you see how many US citizen has been replace with this legal immigrant.WHERE ARE THE PROTECTIONS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS TRAINING THEIR FOREIGN H1B REPLACEMENTS IN ANY OF THESE BILLS?

John Kelly denied what Woodward had quoted him as saying. Another indication that Gen. Kelly has lost any honor he ever had. Now, he is nothing but a shill for Trump. It is disgraceful and Trump has played him for the fool he is. https:// buff.ly/2wHPFix @POTUS @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS We KNOW you made mattis, kelly and sanders write those statements - or did they just spontaneously feel the need, at the same time, to rebuke Woodward's book on only things they said about YOU? pic.twitter.com/I4GZfOMxdO
@realDonaldTrump i saw that @OAN exclusive that #QAnon is a hoax-I thought #Russia was the only hoax going? How many rabbits do they pull out of the hat before #Karma bites them in the tail (all devils have long tails) #MAGA #loveyouPotus #appreciate all you must deal w/for #USA

In fairness, Rep. @RepAdamSchiff , before the election, the Electoral College was fully aware of all of @realDonaldTrump 's shortcomings which you have listed, and yet they still installed him as President. As a Nation, we got what we deserved.

@realDonaldTrump watched Active Measures twice. You're a traitor to this country. Period. Go to hell with your criminal bullshit & burn in hell for eternity. Your administration's literally killing people...SNAP, seniors, vets, climate, pre existing conditions, worker safety.

@Nike @realDonaldTrump Nike, you can do what you want. You're an individual company and if you think this is best for you, fine. If Kaepernick really wanted to help people, wouldn't he want to go help them rather than dis our great flag and the people who watch him play?
@realDonaldTrump Future plans require future cash flows.
