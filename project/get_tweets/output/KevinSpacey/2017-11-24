@BillClinton and @KevinSpacey get more disgusting everyday! And @HillaryClinton continues to condone this behavior.
I don't think I could possibly care less who anybody had consensual sex with or where they did it. It's like @LauraLoomer took the wrong lesson away from the @KevinSpacey ordeal.
So our @KevinSpacey @HouseofCards Christmas ornament will not be on the tree this year since he was a bad bad boy. #HOC #Christmas #KevinSpacey pic.twitter.com/exbE40dNX1
