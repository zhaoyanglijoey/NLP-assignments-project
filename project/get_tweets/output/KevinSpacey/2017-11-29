@KevinSpacey still awesome in my book
@KevinSpacey #IsWorseThanNickelback
@KevinSpacey sad it seems your career is over, hope you find the help you need.
So many have fallen: @BillOReilly @charlierose @jeffreytambor @KevinSpacey @HarveyWeinstein and now @MLauer. What the hell kind of Teflon is our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump made of? Speak up, Ladies. Come on! #OnTheDayTrumpResigns #QAF pic.twitter.com/5RxKSrq197
By the way, I was also a big @KevinSpacey fan and I applaud what you did. Fandom can not excuse predatory behavior.
@KevinSpacey fuck those haters. You rule! pic.twitter.com/9B2XqTcpeu
@KevinSpacey i'm real sorry for your troubles. I have always found you a good actor. Singer. All around nice guy. People's personal problems should be just that..personal. From a fan!

Sexual Misconduct has ended the careers of @HarveyWeinstein , @KevinSpacey , @charlierose , #LouisCK , and now #MattLauerToo He was let go by NBC this morning after 20 years of working there. Slowly but surely action is being taken and it is showing the world that this is NOT OKAY!
You mean: @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @HarveyWeinstein @alfranken #alfrankenstein @KevinSpacey @SenWarren #pocahontas - #TRUMP2020 #KEEPAMERICAGREAT
Hello, @netflix ...will you help @Corey_Feldman to make up for working with @KevinSpacey ? pic.twitter.com/j9kX1ih7QB
Watch @ChristopherPlummer win another Oscar for playing @KevinSpacey 's role in a Ridley Scott movie
@netflix I want an explanation as to why you have no problem firing @KevinSpacey BUT you have no problem keeping @dannymasterson employed while he has been accused of 4 counts of rape. @Scientology have anything to do with it??? #ScientologyTheAftermath @MikeRinder @LeahRemini
A loss: @KevinSpacey , #GarrisonKeillor , @alfranken , @charlierose . Not a loss: #HarveyWeinstein , #MattLauer . I beg all you men out there: pull it together. Go to a therapist. Whatever. Your brilliance is at the mercy of your second head and civilization is better than this.
First @MLauer and @g_keillor next @tombrokaw by the way do you know anyone who has been @KevinSpacey 'ed, I have two friends to add to his list.
Yes. I am sad. And Christopher Plummer is an old man who used to be Captain Von Trapp, but that was 700 years ago... Waiting for @KevinSpacey to resurrect...
This was the one @KevinSpacey got replaced in, right?
@KevinSpacey your movie Pay it Forward stank, but it wasn't as stinky as the farts I have reserved for you. Consider this paid forward: FFFFFFFAAAAAAAARRRRRRTTTT!
@KevinSpacey trying to talk to you on Instagram, do you ever reply?
There they sit in their self-righteous suites & smug turkey necks talking trash! This is just too sweet to be real - one a pedophile & the other an office sexual predator - @MLauer & @KevinSpacey ! Scummy men got exactly what they deserve!
@KevinSpacey You broke my heart Mr Spacey, you are a wonderful actor, I always tried to see the movies you were in...
A daily reminder, that can be applied in many ways: @HouseofCards isn't ending because @albinokid "told" on @KevinSpacey . @HouseofCards is ending because #KevinSpacey is a rapist and assaulter, many times over. U mad? Blame the rapist.
Very quick work: @KevinSpacey gone, #ChristopherPlummer in new trailer for #AllTheMoneyInTheWorld http:// bit.ly/2AmWPgg
I've said this for years- Men are pigs! @realDonaldTrump @KevinSpacey @mattlauer @anthonywiener @alfranken @RoyMooreSenator @HarveyWeinstein @charlierose @g_keillor @anyonewithapenis
Fan of @MLauer, Louis CK, Charlie Rose & @KevinSpacey . VERY disappointed in them.Also I'm really disappointed because Trump is POTUS,Thomas is a justice, pedophile More will be a senator. Also Please stop lumping in @alfranken a great senator Minnesota should be proud of. #Metoo
Replacing . @KevinSpacey in "All the #Money in the #World " wasn't #easy , but to #director #RidleyScott , it was the only #option . http:// abcn.ws/2AizE3X #movies #showbiz
#WednesdayWisdom Here are: Matt Lauer @MLauer Charlie Rose @CharlieRose Garrison Keillor @g_keillor Harvey Weinstein @HarveyWeinstein Kathy Griffin @kathygriffin Kevin Spacey @KevinSpacey Mark Halperin @MarkHalperin Glenn Thrush @GlennThrush right about now.... pic.twitter.com/7OOckPnTH7
Deu vontade ne @kevinspacey ?
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU STOP OBSESSING OVER SEX I'M A MAN AND I'VE NEVER RAPED ANYONE HOW FUCKING HARD IS IT YOU PIECES OF SHIT!!????? #louisck @KevinSpacey #matt Lauer #RoyMoore @realDonaldTrump @HarveyWeinstein i give up, if it's true, i'm done with humans.
"Kevin Spacey" @KevinSpacey your career is done and now everybody know you prefer kids #childmolester so.... pic.twitter.com/25T2ARAtOP
We in #Europe are not watching that... We want @KevinSpacey . He is an actor. Mister #Plummer plays himself. @KevinSpacey played Getty.
@TheTalkCBS I can't find the episodes where you asked if Harvey Weinstein @KevinSpacey Ben Affleck @charlierose @realDonaldTrump Louie CK Roy Moore Brett Ratner Should be forgiven minutes after finding out they are sexual predators like you did with your dear friend Matt Lauer
They DO NOT report on alien abductions . PLEASE And WHO besides Carol Burnett in 1977 has sued @NatEnquirer AND WON? Certainly not @KevinSpacey or @MLauer or @BillClinton & John Edwards. Bill's sexual escapades hv been reported on for 30 yrs & were ACCURATE EVERY TIME.
Hi how are yo? God loves The sinner but not The sin @KevinSpacey
#mattlauerfired #KevinSpacey @KevinSpacey
@HarveyWeinstein @RoyPrice @MarkHalperin @KevinSpacey @andydick @jeffreytambor @MooreSenate @reallouisck @SenFranken @charlierose @mattlauer @g_keillor all paying the price for their alleged sexual misconduct, so why does @realDonaldTrump still have a job?
If @HouseofCards continues with just @RealRobinWright instead of @KevinSpacey , we must challenge them to do the right thing and change the theme song to "Planet Claire" by @TheB52s .
#GrandPaCinema two old men and the money... So sad for the real actor @KevinSpacey
@KevinSpacey Well slap me sideways and call me a shittlebiscuit.
@realDonaldTrump own your behavior @mattlaurer @HarveyWeinstein @louisck @KevinSpacey @BillClinton #incompletelist
Breaking. One of the 3 films I'm gonna smash out next year is actually another film with @KevinSpacey . But don't worry, it's a @realDonaldTrump biopic. @HouseofCards + actual cunt. No method acting required.
How long has @nbc known that #MattLauer is a #rapist , just like @BillClinton @HarveyWeinstein @KevinSpacey @alfranken @realLouisCK and many others? pic.twitter.com/Xh4cJNjFS3
@CharlieRose : Fired @EricBolling : Fired @BillOReilly : Fired @MLauer: Fired @KevinSpacey : Fired #HarveyWeinstein : Fired @MooreSenate : Running for #ALSEN @RealDonaldTrump : Elected President of the United States
#MattLauer And then 1 day we woke up & there were *no* Men w jobs. Ppl ratted on all men & Mothers had to100% support themselves & kids. It was never a win win. @KevinSpacey
Get @KevinSpacey to be a spokesperson. pic.twitter.com/2XhKRtQlRV
Horrible. #ChristopherPlummer plays himself. @KevinSpacey played #Getty . That is the big difference.
