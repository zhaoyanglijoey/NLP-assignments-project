Fuck you @KevinSpacey my idea for a Cory in the house of cards crossover is ruined now. I'm sorry this had to happen @KyleMassey
So @ConstanceWu calls out Casey Affleck for sex assault allegations Similar allegations cause @KevinSpacey , Louis CK & so on to lose jobs @GeorgeTakei is accused of multiple sexual assaults yet still guest starred on #FreshOffTheBoat last night (staring @ConstanceWu ) Silence pic.twitter.com/VL4enUXL0f
@KevinSpacey Hey man dont let the haters get to you you played in a call of duty game! you cant be beat
yet they'll let @KevinSpacey keep his
Who is replacing @KevinSpacey in @HouseofCards ?? #RealTalk
This is how #Hollywood punishes #hollywoodperverts . @KevinSpacey actually thinks a month in "rehab" is going to make up for 30 years of repeated sexual offenses. Crazy isn't it @JuddApatow Kevin Spacey working on his downward dog at rehab http:// pge.sx/2AL3WfB via @PageSix
So light em up! #weinsteinscandal @KevinSpacey #DonnaBrazile #ClintonCrimeFamily @HillaryClinton #awanbrothers @DWStweets #DNCLeaks

@SamAldridge1998 was it @HarveyWeinstein or @KevinSpacey KevinSpacey
Scaremaster, @KevinSpacey has asked me to send $10 to your PayPal account for him, at which time he says you have to unblock him or he'll sue you for false advertising.
Yes indeed.. I'm genuinely intrigued to know what was going on in @KevinSpacey head when (let's be honest) he was absolutely awesome in delivering AMERICAN BEAUTY and Lester Burnham's eventual enlightenment and self control.
I can't believe you would just dismiss 4 separate allegations of rape dating back 10 years (reported to #LAPD at the time, so not jumping on any bandwagons) because you like the guy on the TV. I agree that @netflix is sending mixed messages with the way they axed @KevinSpacey

Seemed timed fairly poorly, like we're all a bunch of @KevinSpacey clones hangin out
