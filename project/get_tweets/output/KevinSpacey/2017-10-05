Haha solid point, how about @KevinSpacey ? You think they'd book him?
He sounds like @KevinSpacey in Swimming with Sharks. Nightmare. OMG. What a POS. #MAGA ? pic.twitter.com/0rack5fsph
Watching @KevinSpacey in #BeyondTheSea and damn is he a talented actor. Keep seeing him as #FrankUnderwood and then he starts singing.
In my opinion after watching first season of designated survivor & ending house of cards surely @KevinSpacey is way better #frankunderwood
