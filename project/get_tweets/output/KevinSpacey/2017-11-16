Anyone who willingly dismissed male behavior using "boys will be boys," has no right to be shocked, mad, or annoyed by @alfranken @KevinSpacey @HarveyWeinstein or @realDonaldTrump -- Because you condoned it to begin with.
@theevinlombardi got raped by @KevinSpacey too.
@chrispage83 was the stag actually @KevinSpacey ?
@TwitterSupport | @KevinSpacey and @HarveyWeinstein should have their verification revoked since they have violated twitter's terms of service
I'm going to start using the @KevinSpacey & @alfranken apology template; "I don't remember doing that but sorry if that happened. But really don't remember." #womensrights
Roses are red, Lingerie is lacey, how many more people accused of sexual misconduct will use the same defense as @KevinSpacey ?
@KevinSpacey hi Kevin hope you are ok xx

The irony that @GeorgeTakei blocked me for speaking against his perverse and predatory behavior is sad because as we know this type of silencing and brushing off the accusations just shows us all your upset about is being caught @alfranken @KevinSpacey pic.twitter.com/1TwdxMmKdM

I'm not sure who's the creepiest .. Roy Moore - @MooreSenate , @KevinSpacey , or Francis Underwood? I can't real life from fiction. Sickening.
Senator @AlFranken = #Democrat , @HarveyWeinstein = Democrat, Former President @BillClinton = Democrat, @KevinSpacey = Democrat, @GeorgeTakei = Democrat, @RealLouisCK = Democrat: ...I don't think I need to say more.

I am fighting back by reporting those on the left who break the new twitter rules like: @HarveyWeinstein @KevinSpacey @BillClinton @SenFranken @kathygriffin @chelseahandler because it says the check mark can be removed for on and off twitter behavior! I have reported others also!
@KevinSpacey Wishing you well, Kevin. I will not judge you. I hope you make your way back from this. Love your acting. Blessings!
#BabyDriver is a good movie if you can get past the terrible ending and the new revelations around @KevinSpacey . @LilyCJames is very good.

@alfranken and @KevinSpacey this is incestuous. @tedlieu has yet to comment on either. pic.twitter.com/NgmKxF4TLz
Senator Roy Moore tweets "Dear Mitch McConnell, Bring. It. On," in reference to a movie about teenage cheerleaders. In a tasteless display of solidarity, @KevinSpacey tweets: "GO MIGHTY DUCKS!'' #RoyMooreChildMolester #KevinSpacey
No. This man needs to step down. Now. It's funny, @HarveyWeinstein is accused? Taken down by public opinion. @KevinSpacey ? Taken down by public opinion. @MooreSenate ? "He'll be dealt with when convicted". What a joke.
#RoyMoore @alfranken @realLouisCK @BrettRatner @KevinSpacey @Harveyweinstien @GeorgeHWBush @BillClinton #RoyPrice #PresidentDonaldTrump This isn't a left or right thing. It's a wrong or right thing.
@twitter looks like you missed another one @KevinSpacey also violated twitters new on or off twitter rules of behavior for having a blue check mark!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MooreSenate @WeinsteinFilms @alfranken @BillClinton @USSenate @BillOReilly @KevinSpacey all of you have much more than politics & $$ in common.Seems the two most silent voices are the 2 presidents in this list of winners. America hurts ,deeply. ASHAMED

As of 4:15pm today, @Twitter is still giving @KevinSpacey & @HarveyWeinstein their full endorsement with a verification badge. This show where priorities are for the new 'editorial' board reviewing Verification Badges. Remember this as verification becomes even more political. pic.twitter.com/fooUN66npE
@KevinSpacey Dear Keavin, I want to share with you my admiration for your talent in your acting works, I am really amazed at your ductility between the inerpretation of one character and another. Congratulations your job is to clap standing!
