@KevinSpacey Giving fuel to dangerous misconceptions is not apologizing or coming out. Gay does not equal abuser.
. @KevinSpacey , the thing to say is: "I was young, felt entitled, i was an asshole, I'M SORRY" not to deflect the conversation.
Amidst indictment news, let's not forget that @KevinSpacey basically dismissed sexual assault accusations by coming out as gay. #lgbt
I support @KevinSpacey . This whole thing smells fishy to me.
don't be strategic now @KevinSpacey you're a pedophile, not homosexual.
Katica pummeled @KevinSpacey 's comment section, and that's why we her. pic.twitter.com/Sc4SIhkbiX
Somewhere @kathygriffin is violently lotioning her face, pissed off as FUCK that @KevinSpacey just stole her thunder. @Andy wins again!
I think most of us already knew, and didn't care, that @KevinSpacey was gay, but what we didn't know was that he's a giant asshole.
Woah! This is the problem with social media. No idea whether @KevinSpacey is guilty or not but I've seen no evidence one way or the other.
@Kevinspacey . Hey Kev, you sayTrump likes Russians but hates foreigners,doesn't read 1 thing for sure,Trump doesn't like 14 year old boys!!!
big news @KevinSpacey is gay. In other news, he is also a pedophile. What a crock of shit. Drunk and Gay doesn't make it ok.

@Rosie if you knew about @KevinSpacey and what he was doing and told no one, you are as sick, twisted and evil as he is. SHAME ON YOU
Suddenly Kevin is the worst person in the world? You never did something you regret? Stop judging. @KevinSpacey is not a pedophile.
I am not condoning anything that @KevinSpacey did but there are an awful lot of people living in glass houses, ready to throw rocks
So, is @KevinSpacey still a paedophile? #KevinSpacey pic.twitter.com/sPp0YL7bat
Thoughts on @KevinSpacey story?
EXACTLY. Tagging us all in with his perverted brush. Vile. Lost every bit of respect for @KevinSpacey and I actually loved his work.
Seass mamon @KevinSpacey
