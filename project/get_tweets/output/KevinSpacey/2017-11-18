Better response than @KevinSpacey a perfect example of an actor that should never open his mouth and speak publicly without written lines
"The list of men who have quit or been removed from prominent positions since early October includes producers [ @HarveyWeinstein ] and [ @BrettRatner ]; actors [ @andydick ] and [ @KevinSpacey ]; comedian Louis C.K. [who used to be @louisck ]; journalists [ @MarkHalperin ] and
also @KevinSpacey 's mantra.
Dear @Netflix , You can't throw @KevinSpacey to the wolves while turning a blind eye to @dannymasterson . COME ON NOW.
Your face when it hits you why @KevinSpacey was so fucking comfortable in the gay Frank Underwood scenes from @HouseofCards pic.twitter.com/dLTwOra9nk
I like @KevinSpacey and feel what may or may not have happened years ago should be left alone. Why wait so long to report it anyway? Oh, because it's crap ...
Go for the hat trick and invite your good friends @KevinSpacey @HarveyWeinstein and @alfranken
Identical to @BillClinton and @KevinSpacey except the latter preferred young boys.
The allegations including the ones against @KevinSpacey are from before the age of Internet porn
@KevinSpacey FYI - @officialmoz just applied to be your new publicist.
@KevinSpacey And how I was wrong to ever think, that shit got some where when it really stinks. Love Steve L.
@KevinSpacey For that little ass I will not pay. And thats our big problem we paid all along they got what they got because we were strong
@KevinSpacey It's what I liked, and For normall perverts like us it's just what we do. Sometimes with money and power we say,
@KevinSpacey how would you describe this cat? pic.twitter.com/SVnyffUcxH
@KevinSpacey So just from me to you in my kindest way I want you to know that I am not gay. I got plenty of ass and pussy too.
@netflix @HouseofCards @KevinSpacey I refuse to watch the series without Frank. Lose ALL the quality gained until today. live Underwood!!!
@KevinSpacey Get lost I never saw love coming across. So let me just say it's all kinda odd, I like to wtite poems and and positive nodds.
@KevinSpacey And still it's for me to accept from another the love that I have as Father and Mother. It's kinda confusing but let's not
@KevinSpacey @HarveyWeinstein @alfranken @MooreSenate @GeorgeHWBus you choose
@KevinSpacey That boy I did love, he is my son. He taught bout love in far away places for him there is live but for me 2 many faces.
@KevinSpacey For now there's regret, a life mostly alone. And had little respect for those on there own. Except there was one just him & I,
@KevinSpacey Of course they did, I just wasn't there. Now that I'm older I can discern, I'm worthy of love I just have to learn.
@KevinSpacey On it would go from morning till dusk all those late nights and into the dawn. But what about me? Did anyone care?.
Hey @KevinSpacey I didn't pay for my gas and when I got caught I said "I'm straight" and I still suffered the consequences. My question is do you have to be gay or famous to get away with everything?
@KevinSpacey But how can this be I ask with a smile. Sometimes for me it's all about stress earning and yearning to just be the best.
@KevinSpacey And over the years I did the same. I lost at love and got lost in the game. I think we all do at least for a while,
@KevinSpacey So many credits with you on the ball 4 me, it's beyond the sea, was the greatest of all.
@KevinSpacey Dear Kevin. I want you to know, I'm not gonna judge you it's part of my show.
The most ironic gif I've ever seen @KevinSpacey lol pic.twitter.com/fj2MJ1u9VA
Acabo de matar a @KevinSpacey en el @CallofDuty #AdvancedWafare . Me quiso tocar el exoesqueleto.
I've done the same with @KevinSpacey , etc
On @AmericanAir ; @KevinSpacey on Screen 8X. Time to remove him from selections amidst multiple harassment claims? Thoughts? @tonykatz #shame
@NETFLIX instead of canceling house of cards bc @KevinSpacey is a piece trash, can u plz just kill him off and put Claire Underwood in the oval office??
