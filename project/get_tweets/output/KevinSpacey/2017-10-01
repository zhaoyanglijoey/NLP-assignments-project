Latent homosexual @KevinSpacey is all about advancing the cause. This seems like something right from the #Pedophilia playbook. pic.twitter.com/1miMM1ofV0

@KevinSpacey I just say Beyond the Sea. Not sure why I never saw it earlier, because it was brilliant! You did a service to Bobby Darin.

@KevinSpacey on season 3 episode 10 @HouseofCards Amazing!
Thank you @KevinSpacey for #houseofcards it's the epitome of engaging and intriguing television

Why @KevinSpacey hasn't called me for a hook-up, I'll never know.
