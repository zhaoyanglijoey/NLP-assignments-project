Why are we holding a fictional president that @KevinSpacey plays to a higher standard than an actual president in @realDonaldTrump who is also a rapist? Thank you @netflix for having the morality the leaders of this country do not.
List of #Trump haters who blasted Trump for locker room talk, yet are accused of doing much worse: @GeorgeTakei @RichardDreyfuss @DavidCornDC Harvey Weinstein @charliesheen @KevinSpacey The hypocrisy is absolutely stunning! #MAGA
Wow. First @KevinSpacey then @GeorgeTakei now @RichardDreyfuss who's next? Anyone have a pool started? #Pervert
I feel it in the air. It may be a little early to tell at #iwca2017 but that didn't stop @KevinSpacey !
Lyin' Ted cares more about illegal aliens, @KevinSpacey , and his regressive, leftist agenda. pic.twitter.com/70akdOdQln
@KevinSpacey I love and support Kevin. I don't believe the bs and don't be distracted by all the fake news out there. People of course want money and fame without care if they hurt anyone to get what they want. #GodSeesAll
@KevinSpacey still a huge fan. Ur body of works speaks for itself. IF, allegations r true then speak up and admit, apologize n repent.
@KevinSpacey used to think his career was over. Luckily for him, it appears there may be some new and exciting opportunities as a respected member of the @GOP
@KevinSpacey <Freak..House of Cards now has a new replacement Kevin James! #KevinSpaceyDumped
