The tweets from #wbh18 @SFU are reminding me of my abandoned projects of the mid 90s. One on Wollstonecraft and Johnson, one on Victoria Press. Abandoned because there was #womenshistory but no #womensbookhistory , and support was not forthcoming, anywhere.

And now the @SFU roundtable, starting with Leith Davis on women writers and national song -- breaking open the silos and reintegrate their work into the larger national project #wbh18
