Fighting for Tuition to be frozen! The proposed increases disproportionately affects International Students who are already being burdened by high fees and hurts low income families the most. Important that we stand up for what we believe in at this uni! @SFU @sfusoca pic.twitter.com/qMesfwgqmz

Tomorrow I will be staffing a table at Spooktacular, an @SFU @SFU_Science @SFUResearch outreach event that usually gets hundreds of visitors from locals schools and the surrounding community. I'll be showing off some skulls and teeth of marine predators from the collection. pic.twitter.com/zq7GACoSza

One more sleep until the #ScienceSpooktacular @SFU . Looking forward to a day full of science & fun. https:// youtu.be/fmdFbqqpocw
I'd go with the @SFU AQ. It is a building, one that creates the space inside. Shot from outside or inside, from above or from the ground, it's unmistakeable.

My answer is the Arts Building at @mcgillu . I might make a case for the academic quad at @SFU , but a) it's a space not a building and b) as many people will recognize it as FBI HQ in the X-files or a shopping district on Caprica as an SFU building.
Shoutout to @SFU for having this happen, and a student got assaulted in class the other week multiple times. Worst leadership at a school in Canada.

@SFU is a joke for enforcing safety policies AGAINST calling 911, first. After the incident about the school downplaying a kid throwing a table across a room? Like "it wasn't a big deal?" I'm so ashamed that THIS is why my school is making headlines. Shame on #SFU
this seems a little backwards. a bunch of different 10 digit numbers instead of dialing 911. really @SFU ?
God damn insensitive @SFU #Shame
Release from @SFU on emergency protocol at the school. No information about a student who died while taking his midterm -- which happened on Oct 17. This comes after a violent incident on campus earlier this month when a student attacked others in class. @NEWS1130 pic.twitter.com/gGilSOYmcG
Touching story's about #women fighting against all odds and fulfilling their dream was told at #HealinginCooking tonight, applauds to the women behind #Soufra and @Tayybeh1 for their #courage . @PchcMoM @CMSnewyork #Migration #empowerment #inspiring @SFU pic.twitter.com/YbXjFhEUw0
No one started bystander CPR???? How horrific. @SFU I hope this death encourages you to step up student and faculty CPR classes. This death was could have been preventable since it was witnessed In a timely manner. So tragic!
That is the stupidest policy and @SFU is now partially responsible for this man's death. Always, always, always call 911 first, regardless of whatever stupid policy someone quotes at you.
Stewart teaches Poli Sci at @douglascollege and @SFU . About 50% of attendees already have researched and have an idea of how they'll vote. Of those people, about 50% want PR and 50% want FPTP. #pr4bc
People centred science: reflection; community-driven goals; deep relationship building; appropriate data; collaborative learning + explanation; understanding how politics + policies work in communities @sdosemagen @sfu @PublicLab #PublicKnowledge #CitizenScience #sfu

Now not only is a man dead, but you have a class of traumatized students who feel incredibly guilty for not calling 911 because of unbelievably stupid policy. I hope his family sues @SFU
Ok I am beyond outraged at the story of the 58yo man who died in class at SFU during a test because @SFU encourages the students to call campus security INSTEAD OF 911!! 911 CAN PROVIDE LIFE SAVING INFORMATION UNTIL HELP ARRIVES. You let him die
