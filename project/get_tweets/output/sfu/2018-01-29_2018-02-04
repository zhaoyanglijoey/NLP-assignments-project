Define Clan: #NCAA @SFU I understand when we say "Clan" people hear "Klan" but that's on you, not on us. We ARE A Close-nit group of family, don't take that away from us because of a bunch of racists that have NOTHING to do with anything that SFU Proudly represents. pic.twitter.com/ZxfIMMwl28
and we damned sure ain't racists, so yes I think that @SFU should keep the "Clansmen" and I think some of yall should read up on some history and quit accusing this great school of being racist because it has NOTHING to do with racism Its an honor to be part of the SFU Clan #NCAA
that people are all about "black lives matter" while simultaneously trying to erase the proud history of the founding members of @SFU , as a Black woman, I understand the argument, but as a lover of history and a descendant of the Scotts, keep the name, We ARE A CLAN! We are PROUD
Controversial opinion, but I do NOT think that @SFU now a proud member of the #NCAA should NOT Change their name from "The Clan" it's a proud Scottish Tradition that has NOTHING to do with racism, and it's kind of offensive to me, as a descendant of Clansmen, not KLANSMEN 1/3
