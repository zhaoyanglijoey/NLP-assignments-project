Stuck on campus? Need some caffeine or somewhere war to come. All Welcome at the Interfaith Centre AQ3200. Watch http://www. sfu.ca @sfu for updates re:snow and Translink for transit. pic.twitter.com/V2Y2IeYbkP
Great question! I haven't been up there today, but would like to find out. Anyone at @SFU or @TransLink know?
@ubc @ubcokanagan @SFU @douglascollege @thompsonriversu @langaracollege @CapilanoU @UNBC @goUFV @VCAD @EmilyCarrU @selkirkcollege @TrinityWestern Can you please pass this information on to your students via twitter. Ryan Shtuka has been missing for 7 days from SunPeaks pic.twitter.com/nyEy3vOqwB

Hi there, today's test kit pick-up has been cancelled due to the weather. It is being rescheduled to Monday, Feb. 26 from 4 to 7 pm at North Vancouver Library. @SFUResearch @SFU @SFU_FHS @CAREXCanada @CBCNews
@sfu @translink please confirm if shuttle is operational. Which TC?
@TransLink isn't providing any info regarding the @SFU shuttles on any of their sites. SFU needs to intervene with @Translink to figure out how to get these people safely off the mountain.
@SFU 's inclement weather policy is the literal definition of a joke.
Can you claim to be a real @SFU student if you haven't been stuck on the mountain at least once during a #snowmageddon ?
@TransLink @sfu . We need buses.
Shoutout to @SFU for their complete disregard for their students again keeping the school open when they cannot get people home safely! #sfu
@carolejames @SFU It was great to meet BC Finance Minister and Deputy Premier, the Honourable Carole James as she delivered her first 2018 post-budget address and policy priorities at the Surrey Board of Trade breakfast event today. pic.twitter.com/oxsGPza7rk
@SFU will the gaglardi Road path down the mountain eventually be plowed once there is less traffic? Please help, deciding whether to drive right now or wait till there is less traffic and the roads plowed
@SFU Alternative approach: in parts of Canada with regular snow, school closures are determined before opening- that way campuses close preemptively instead of waiting until it's too late to do anything and students are stranded/walking down the mountain...
SFU will return to normal operations tomorrow. Continue to check @SFU on twitter and the university website ( http:// SFU.CA ) for updates.
@Sfu it only works to cancel classes BEFORE you strand thousands of students on campus.
@sfu @BCTransit Updates would be nice. Can you confirm if busses are running?
@SFU , @myVCC , @douglascollege , @EmilyCarrU and @bcit have also cancelled afternoon classes due to #bcstorm . Follow our story for live updates during the afternoon commute: http:// bit.ly/2EYSYIq pic.twitter.com/oqz11ag4to

@SFU when SFU delayed their announcement! pic.twitter.com/tlIx3vdEzJ
@SFU are campuses open or closed?
Please note the @SFUVan campus is closed due to the weather and road conditions with limited operations. All classes and exams are cancelled from 12:30pm onwards. @SFU students, staff and faculty, other than those providing core services, should head home. http:// ow.ly/bMfA30iAefF
Leave it to @SFU to close last minute so people who take @TransLink can just be stuck on the mountain
hey @SFU maybe try cancelling school BEFORE everyone is stranded up here!!!
@SFU is the fitness centre closed as well?
#Burnaby - All classes at @SFU Burnaby Mountain have been cancelled for the rest of the day ^RLid
Beautiful day for learning @SFU Back in my day, we had to walk 10 miles in the snow, uphill both ways. pic.twitter.com/Ha82xQ9GrK
Are any buses or shuttles coming to Burnaby @SFU ?
Trapped on baby mountain waiting for buses cuz @SFU doesn't cancel classes before the buses stop running pic.twitter.com/qDY0nEWKCI
