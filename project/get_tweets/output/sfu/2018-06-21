Wow! @SFU is connected to that woman and her event? Pretty sad.
Is this event actually being sponsored by @SFSS1 and @SFU ? Please do a simple Google search on Facilitator Kari Simpson and her organization Culture Guard and decide if #SFU should in *any way* be involved... #LGBTQ #TransLivesMatter #transrightsarehumanrights pic.twitter.com/i4a9wfh0WJ
