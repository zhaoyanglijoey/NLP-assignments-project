And the biggest risk of 14 more oil storage tanks on top of existing 12 on Burnaby Mountain is IMMEDIATE FIRE DANGER to 10000s of North Burnaby residents, students, staff, and volunteers @SFU . Perhaps Brent needs some reading comprehension
Not the 14 new oil tanks that will come if KM can ram the new pipeline. A major difference between 12 and 26 oil tanks on the south side of Burnaby Mountain. And 10000s residents around Burnaby Mountain and up to 30000 students, staff, and volunteers @SFU have to bear that risk
