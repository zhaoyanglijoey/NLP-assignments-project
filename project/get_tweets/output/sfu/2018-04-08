I am so pleased to be spending the next week on the #WestCoast ! I will be meeting with @ubcprez , visiting @sfu and @uvic , touring the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and of course, speaking at #TED2018 . It's a busy week and I can't wait to get started. #cdnsci #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/WGJ0JAEpng

To the @SFU student who returned my phone last Thursday @The #Burnaby Campus, just know you are an angel among humans. Could have walked away but you totally did the right thing. Thank you. <3
Hi @artfulretro proceeds from our Pilsner for Autism goes towards research programs into the condition with the @SFU Faculty of Science. Autism is something that is very close to us as well. Is there something we could do better?
