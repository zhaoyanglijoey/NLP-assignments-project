What a despicable, filthy statement for that young woman to make. She should be duly shamed, and ashamed. That she helps to run a department @SFU , adds it to the list of one more institution to avoid.

follow-up qu for @learnpublishing #sfupublishing @SFU @SFU_Media ... supercool that they're standing by @hkpmcgregor profane university-sanctioned racial attack on @MargaretAtwood & @angie_abdou (free speech rules!)... But if so, why was the podcast containing this attack deleted?
"I would like to acknowledge that this fcking podcast was recorded on unceded fcking indigenous land unsullied by shitty white women such as Margaret atwood. copyright fcking @SFU assholes"
indeed @hkpmcgregor uses language that would get my 6 year old sent to the principal's office. and this is a woman who helps run a department at @SFU
here's the relevant part of the transcript from the @SFU @hkpmcgregor podcast. the episode was deleted without comment or apology pic.twitter.com/nDVZigzSe3
reading Steven Galloway's tell-all, this time in print & noticing details I missed yesterday. e.g. That podcast @hkpmcgregor did attacking me & Angie Abdou & accusing Atwood of being a "shitty white woman" was actually *sanctioned* be her employer @SFU . any comment, @SFU_Media ? pic.twitter.com/Sc6ttUZzUY
