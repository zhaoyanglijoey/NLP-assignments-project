There are lots of applications of VR in the older adult population cropping up everywhere. I think it would be a great project! Learning Technologies with @VCHClinicalEd are looking into VR for staff education. @SFU SIAT is also using VR for pain control. Vancouver is a VR hub!
Big lesson for me, when I was going through my Computing Science degree at @SFU there was massive hate on Neural Networks but I knew it was going to change computing science - stick to your gut, crazy applications of Neural Networks shown today in my Designing Data Products class
On behalf of my @SFU colleagues, thanks Alex of @sweatscience for two fascinating lectures, and for your new and insightful book #endure . pic.twitter.com/bM2z3PtPSW
