Cheerleading squad practice gone wrong - #cheerleaders #cheerleading @espn @ucla @UBC @SFU
Let's go and maybe make it a @SFU - @Concordia trip so that our chaperone tickets will be covered! It could be branded the "Next Year in Bukhara, Baby" tour slash pilgrimage ;)
Thank you for inspiring happy memories for me, too, Anna. Loved my time @SFU
@SFU im really interested in the recent research study done for Air Canada regarding rhe effect of beards on face mask efficiency. Where can i find out more details about the research?
