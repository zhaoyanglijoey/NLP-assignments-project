Can you imagine if you paid money to @SFU and had your kid being taught by @hkpmcgregor ??? Holy mackerel!!!
Wow. And @SFU stands behind her statements. Does the institution not realize that its reputation is its only currency? Devaluing it does its hardworking students (and alumni) a real disservice. So glad I went to @UBC !
Universities need to be held to higher standards and defunded for the intolerance they seem to support and many liberal arts professors spew out. @SFU fire this woman this is unacceptable.
Extraordinary that any university @SFU @UBC could (let alone would) employ a person like @hkpmcgregor to teach. While you cannot blame a stupid person for being stupid - it is those who enable and facilitate people and behavior like this who need to be held to account. @SFUmedia
Absolutely - @SFUFootball is building towards a break out 2018 season but they need all the support @SFUClan @SFUalumni @SFU can give them
