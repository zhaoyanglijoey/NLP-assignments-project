Thank you, appreciate that. I'm sure there's a reason - e.g. UBC supplies funding - but I still don't think it's a good practice for the city to limit access to this program to only one local post-sec institution. I know it has produced a lot of great work though. @sfu
We're proud partner with researchers from @ubcLFS and @SFU Health Sciences to learn more about our members and their usage trends. Learn more through this @VanCourierNews article, which spoke with our Member Relations and Research Manager, Darlene! http:// ow.ly/gkUx30iuo2u
Retweeted Simon Fraser Univ. ( @SFU ): Congratulations to #SFU former SFU athlete Justin Kripps for winning gold... https:// fb.me/94GSsA7L1
Have always been curious why this great program is limited to UBC students. Plenty of grad students at @SFU doing work relevant to greenest city in SFU REM, geography, urban studies and other depts & programs.
