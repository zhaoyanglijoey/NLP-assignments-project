I don't pretend to know what NYC should do. Vancouver @bctranslink is moving to replace crowded buses with trains to @UBC and long-term might run gondola up to @SFU . Healthcare swing shifts are tough for Seattle except right at UW Medical Center.
The final preparations for @GNACsports Championships this weekend had the track heating up today @SFU ! Travel day on Thursday to Monmouth, Oregon with competition Friday/Saturday & many conference titles to be won! #TrueNorthRising #NCAAeh #sunnydays pic.twitter.com/km6hYVq1bm
I think the @mukurtu website might go through some of the reasons databases have been challenging for people in the past. @CodifiConnect too maybe with their TK labels. Also @SFU https://www. sfu.ca/ipinch/ .

It's been a minute since I've studied at @SFU . Where can I find a microwave?
Didn't @Lauren_Southern do women's studies at @SFU for a while, perhaps on a lark? I thought about it, for similar reasons. Women's Studies, with a student bringing up truth, could be fun as hell.
