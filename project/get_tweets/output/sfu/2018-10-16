I'm all for deliberation and consultation, but it is bizarre to me that @SFU hasn't settled policy on campus cannabis use yet and is only sending out this initial guidance a few hours before legalization. pic.twitter.com/qTt7YDKwx5
People walk in zigzags when texting at the same time. @SFU Burnaby is especially dangerous

Looks like my office will be pretty far (and hopefully upwind) from the new @SFU designated cannabis smoking locations. I'm sure I'll get used to the new normal very quickly, but still feels odd.l pic.twitter.com/02gcvkOXwT

FYI, here's where you can smoke dope on my @SFU campus. But not until it becomes legal tomorrow. So thoughtful of them. pic.twitter.com/djQe9gqFUL
I didn't expect @SFU to have an armed response unit or something but the lack of a proper response is embarrassing and frightening. Unacceptable. Admin too busy asking for donations to have an emergency response plan besides "get over it"?
