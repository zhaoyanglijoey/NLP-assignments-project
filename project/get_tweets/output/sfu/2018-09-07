Like you, my personal preference would be to see fewer non-TT instructors. Stable employment helps people focus on their research and teaching. I was fortunate that in my undergrad at @SFU I had only 1 sessional. All else were TT research or teaching focused
@SFUInstituteHum Director @SFU Professor Samir Gandesha will be speaking @uvic on Tuesday, September 11th, on "The Rise of Authoritarian Populism: Is Left Populism the Answer?" at 5:00-6:30 pm in the David Strong Building Room C122.
OneNote is hands down the most essential tool I used in my 5 years at @Sfu and throughout my professional career and in my indie app developer life. It is the most flexible, OS-agnostic, powerful tool anyone can ever have in their productivity arsenal. @msonenote is outstanding.
Energized after @MichaelArbeider defense. My "review": (1) North BC require more estuary research, (2) diet trough time and space give us insight in generalist habits of some salmon species, (3) science well executed and passion for life are very contagious ! @SFU @E2ocean

One piece of #advice I would give to #students : seize the opportunities that @SFU provides. Join exchange, co-op, mentorship programs & more. Once you graduate, you won't have as many opportunities at your fingertips.
