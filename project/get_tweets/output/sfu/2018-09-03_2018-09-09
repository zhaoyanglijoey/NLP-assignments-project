Like you, my personal preference would be to see fewer non-TT instructors. Stable employment helps people focus on their research and teaching. I was fortunate that in my undergrad at @SFU I had only 1 sessional. All else were TT research or teaching focused

One piece of #advice I would give to #students : seize the opportunities that @SFU provides. Join exchange, co-op, mentorship programs & more. Once you graduate, you won't have as many opportunities at your fingertips.
