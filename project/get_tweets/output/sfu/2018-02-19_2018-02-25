Thank you, appreciate that. I'm sure there's a reason - e.g. UBC supplies funding - but I still don't think it's a good practice for the city to limit access to this program to only one local post-sec institution. I know it has produced a lot of great work though. @sfu

Hi there, today's test kit pick-up has been cancelled due to the weather. It is being rescheduled to Monday, Feb. 26 from 4 to 7 pm at North Vancouver Library. @SFUResearch @SFU @SFU_FHS @CAREXCanada @CBCNews
@sfu @translink please confirm if shuttle is operational. Which TC?
@TransLink isn't providing any info regarding the @SFU shuttles on any of their sites. SFU needs to intervene with @Translink to figure out how to get these people safely off the mountain.
@SFU 's inclement weather policy is the literal definition of a joke.
Can you claim to be a real @SFU student if you haven't been stuck on the mountain at least once during a #snowmageddon ?
@TransLink @sfu . We need buses.
Shoutout to @SFU for their complete disregard for their students again keeping the school open when they cannot get people home safely! #sfu

@SFU will the gaglardi Road path down the mountain eventually be plowed once there is less traffic? Please help, deciding whether to drive right now or wait till there is less traffic and the roads plowed
@SFU Alternative approach: in parts of Canada with regular snow, school closures are determined before opening- that way campuses close preemptively instead of waiting until it's too late to do anything and students are stranded/walking down the mountain...
SFU will return to normal operations tomorrow. Continue to check @SFU on twitter and the university website ( http:// SFU.CA ) for updates.
@Sfu it only works to cancel classes BEFORE you strand thousands of students on campus.
@sfu @BCTransit Updates would be nice. Can you confirm if busses are running?
