What a despicable, filthy statement for that young woman to make. She should be duly shamed, and ashamed. That she helps to run a department @SFU , adds it to the list of one more institution to avoid.

follow-up qu for @learnpublishing #sfupublishing @SFU @SFU_Media ... supercool that they're standing by @hkpmcgregor profane university-sanctioned racial attack on @MargaretAtwood & @angie_abdou (free speech rules!)... But if so, why was the podcast containing this attack deleted?
"I would like to acknowledge that this fcking podcast was recorded on unceded fcking indigenous land unsullied by shitty white women such as Margaret atwood. copyright fcking @SFU assholes"
indeed @hkpmcgregor uses language that would get my 6 year old sent to the principal's office. and this is a woman who helps run a department at @SFU
here's the relevant part of the transcript from the @SFU @hkpmcgregor podcast. the episode was deleted without comment or apology pic.twitter.com/nDVZigzSe3
reading Steven Galloway's tell-all, this time in print & noticing details I missed yesterday. e.g. That podcast @hkpmcgregor did attacking me & Angie Abdou & accusing Atwood of being a "shitty white woman" was actually *sanctioned* be her employer @SFU . any comment, @SFU_Media ? pic.twitter.com/Sc6ttUZzUY

Can you imagine if you paid money to @SFU and had your kid being taught by @hkpmcgregor ??? Holy mackerel!!!
Wow. And @SFU stands behind her statements. Does the institution not realize that its reputation is its only currency? Devaluing it does its hardworking students (and alumni) a real disservice. So glad I went to @UBC !
Universities need to be held to higher standards and defunded for the intolerance they seem to support and many liberal arts professors spew out. @SFU fire this woman this is unacceptable.
Extraordinary that any university @SFU @UBC could (let alone would) employ a person like @hkpmcgregor to teach. While you cannot blame a stupid person for being stupid - it is those who enable and facilitate people and behavior like this who need to be held to account. @SFUmedia
Absolutely - @SFUFootball is building towards a break out 2018 season but they need all the support @SFUClan @SFUalumni @SFU can give them
