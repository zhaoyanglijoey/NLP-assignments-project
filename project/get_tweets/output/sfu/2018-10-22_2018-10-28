Vampires are part of Eastern European culture, representative of the dark days when noblemen fed off the peasants (economically, sexually, etc). How dare you trivialize them & commit #CulturalAppropriation @SFU ?! This poster is so #offensive . #NotACostume @GadSaad pic.twitter.com/8Kq2ObVwb4
Hey #SimonFraserUniversity ( @SFU ) student and residents. I am conducting a survey for one of my courses and would appreciate your response. Your answers may help you in the future. Check the link here- https://www. surveymonkey.com/r/GWCH7BH or scan the QR code pic.twitter.com/mr1lhbWnnb
@SFU , did you even read your own posters? You're supposed to know the history of what a costume represents before deciding it's okay, & Mummy-Costumes are #NotACostume because #CulturalAppropriation ! Also Vampires belong to Eastern European culture, how dare you trivialize them? pic.twitter.com/rMtCstXV3k
Why is @SFU appropriating Egyptian culture in such an offensive way?!? Mummies are part of Egyptian culture, representative of their rich history & noble, powerful kings #Pharaohs ! To trivialize them as silly cartoon costumes is disgusting #CulturalAppropriation ! #NotACostume pic.twitter.com/7ccIHsIuH2

My answer is the Arts Building at @mcgillu . I might make a case for the academic quad at @SFU , but a) it's a space not a building and b) as many people will recognize it as FBI HQ in the X-files or a shopping district on Caprica as an SFU building.
Shoutout to @SFU for having this happen, and a student got assaulted in class the other week multiple times. Worst leadership at a school in Canada.

@SFU is a joke for enforcing safety policies AGAINST calling 911, first. After the incident about the school downplaying a kid throwing a table across a room? Like "it wasn't a big deal?" I'm so ashamed that THIS is why my school is making headlines. Shame on #SFU
this seems a little backwards. a bunch of different 10 digit numbers instead of dialing 911. really @SFU ?
God damn insensitive @SFU #Shame
Release from @SFU on emergency protocol at the school. No information about a student who died while taking his midterm -- which happened on Oct 17. This comes after a violent incident on campus earlier this month when a student attacked others in class. @NEWS1130 pic.twitter.com/gGilSOYmcG

No one started bystander CPR???? How horrific. @SFU I hope this death encourages you to step up student and faculty CPR classes. This death was could have been preventable since it was witnessed In a timely manner. So tragic!
That is the stupidest policy and @SFU is now partially responsible for this man's death. Always, always, always call 911 first, regardless of whatever stupid policy someone quotes at you.

Now not only is a man dead, but you have a class of traumatized students who feel incredibly guilty for not calling 911 because of unbelievably stupid policy. I hope his family sues @SFU
Ok I am beyond outraged at the story of the 58yo man who died in class at SFU during a test because @SFU encourages the students to call campus security INSTEAD OF 911!! 911 CAN PROVIDE LIFE SAVING INFORMATION UNTIL HELP ARRIVES. You let him die
