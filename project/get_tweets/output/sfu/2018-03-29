Universities are always asking me for donations....you want my money? Make these institutions about free speech again and not liberal censorship and then we can talk about it @UAlberta @mcgillu @McMasterU @UofT @UBC @SFU @Carleton_U @DalhousieU #Canada #NoCensorship #FreeSpeech
@UBC & @SFU are selling out our local students as fast as they can. They don't care about local kids. #bcpoli shouldn't allow the university's to take a single foreign student until every local kid w/ reasonable grades is placed first! @jjhorgan @bcndp
And last but certainly not least, congratulations to @SFU 's Dr. Marinko Sarunic & Seymour Vision on their #BCICIgnite Award of $300,000! pic.twitter.com/e0dwrTLgKh
