@SFU with the @Technovation #Program supporting these amazing groups of young female entrepreneurs and techies! Let the fun begin.
Talking about public engagement, Sarah Heim from @SFU : "To grow interest in #Fairtrade , advocates need to feel like they are empowered to be leaders in collective movements. We must hold ourselves accountable for the change we seek." #FTConference2018
Because of it's high demand, our event with @SFUhealth_promo has moved to AQ3153 at @SFU Burnaby to increase space! That means we have opened up a few more seats for Wednesday's workshop. Be sure to register early: http:// ht.ly/KHJq30iIQjQ pic.twitter.com/KDIzN1HrML
