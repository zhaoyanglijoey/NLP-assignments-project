Hey @SFU maybe we should have teachers who, I don't know, actually enjoy teaching and you know, aren't more concerned with their research than helping their students gain knowledge. pic.twitter.com/Vb5b3KJ7T4

Kennedy Corrigan leads @WOUWolves with 16 pts in her 4th start of the season. Natalie DeLonge adds another 12 as she sets herself a new season-high, but the Wolves fall 81-67 to @SFU as their losing streak extends to 6. Hard-fought 2nd half as WOU had it within 4 early in the 4th
RS So. Natalie DeLonge w/ 9 first-half points for WOU. Lot of work to be done for @wouwolves . They trail @SFU 43-28 at the break. Wolves just 3-of-8 at the FT line.
Good guess, but it's the Water Tower / communications tower at the top of Burnaby Mountain @SFU
