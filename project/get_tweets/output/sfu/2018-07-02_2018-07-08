Clearly remember a conversation in 2006 where my brother, Marc, who is now a PhD candidate @SFU , and I worked out how @KingJames would end up with @Lakers , even though we firmly disapproved at the time. We never thought we would have to experience a 9 year drought though, so....
Check out @SFU #restorativejustice program. AMAZING!!!
