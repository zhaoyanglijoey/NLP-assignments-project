1) I might be convinced by this if I didn't see 3 regular-sized buses idling beside the university bus loop 2) coordinate with @SFU and other universities next, many student could've avoided the bus up had the driver informed them about snow day.
Praying for safe travels and for anyone on campus. Check @SFU for campus updates and @TransLink for transit inquiries #makesfuhome #staysafe #BCStorm
