Excited to be heading to @SFU next term to teach a fascinating #Linguistics course on language, culture and society!
Hey @KirstenZickfeld thanks for your work! Are you aware of @sfu 's investments in fossil fuels? Makes tweets like this a bit hypocritical (on their part). Any chance you can influence their divestment plan?
So are you announcing @sfu 's divestment of fossil fuel investments today?
The @IPCC_CH released it's special report on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. @SFU Geography professor @KirstenZickfeld was one of two Canadians chosen to author the report, along with dozens of other experts around the world. Read more here http://www. ipcc.ch/report/sr15/
