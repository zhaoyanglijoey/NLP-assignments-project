This is a total lie! @SFU stayed silent and did nothing when they should have kept women safe!
. @CTVVancouver you should investigate bernie maroney @SFU . Countless girls over the years have reported him and the faculty has done nothing to stop his harassment
It's downright disturbing that @SFU tries to downplay and hide facts instead of keeping students safe. TELL THE TRUTH! You did this last year too. This is a pattern. Maybe someone should run a story about sexual assault coverups by SFU.
