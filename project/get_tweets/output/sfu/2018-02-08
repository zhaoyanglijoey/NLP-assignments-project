. @SFU will reduce its carbon footprint by 30% by 2030, but @sfu350 (which I belong to) continues to work on #divestment . I believe divestment is needed and look forward to the just and managed decline of activities that cause anthropogenic climate change. #SFU
not that I can vote for u but where do u stand on divestment? and why has @SFU done nothing to divest from fossil fuels?

C Morrissey: End on a high (or 3): birds can recover from neonics exposure, undisturbed wetlands have lower neonics levels, neonics moratorium in UK led to no crop losses @SFU #Biology
