For the first time, I saw a Tesla Models S, I was so happy to see it even if it wasn't mine @elonmusk @Tesla , it is such a masterpiece. I hope I will get one one day. pic.twitter.com/TD9BeFeYsM
@tesla @teslasupport are you having issues with Tesla powerwall software & app? I'm not seeing accurate power flow last 2 days, same with neighbor.
Too little too late. @Tesla cared about the world first.
Hey @elonmusk , do you think we'll ever get a @Tesla store in Panama City, Panama? I've seen a 2 model S and 1 model X on the road here. Some i3 and i8. There is big interest here and a bit luxury market to at least sell 5-10k units a year. Without taking into account model 3
I wounder if @Tesla made an #EpilepsyWarning for that in the #manual ... I hope so...

Imagine those fatty guys from wanted to buy @Tesla to definitely condamne it for ever to sell their Dino juice!f
I understand that @tesla uses fluid based coolants for their batteries.
@Tesla @elonmusk @TeslaMotorsClub all customers should be privileged to same benefits regarding supercharging. It should not be differentiated by different time windows which is unfair when everyone is spending over $60k on the car! Make your rules consistent for everyone!!!! H
Hoping that you had a wonderful time visiting California, seeing the Fremont @Tesla factory, meeting friends @Manic_Marge , delivering Sachertortes, test driving the Model 3, accelerating like crazy in a Model S 100D, sipping great CA wines, meeting more friends.. Wow, so jealous!

Helpful to see what @Tesla sees as the range of the disaster. It's local to me, but lucky for me, not so close to the border of the disaster.

If any Tesla owners in California lost there house in the recent fires, we would love to help out. Having a Tesla w/DreamCase combined with HEPA filter could be helpful in such a situation, use the car as a relaxing zone with fresh air. @Tesla or @elonmusk help out ? pic.twitter.com/3rpLcowHml
@elonmusk @Tesla what are the motor specs for a Model X? Voltage? HP? Hz?
I really wish @Tesla would start thinking small. The urban driver needs a subcompact. Kind of like this, but put more of the old #TeslaStank on it @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/wSh2H40mha
Huh. No SEC investigation on that right??? Ugh... Rules only apply to a few I see. @elonmusk needs to ignore and keep up the good fight. Go @Tesla
Disappointing @Uber experience last weekend. We've ordored a @Uber and waited for 15 min. We were super happy when we've seen it was a @Tesla model X. When the driver arrived he refused us... It was too far and the car was running out of battery. We arrived late at our event ..
@elonmusk and @Tesla - left my little dog in Model 3, with climate control on of course, and came out to find he opened two windows! He is a good boy so he was still in the car but maybe Pet Mode could prevent the windows from opening. Frunk puppy photo for fun. pic.twitter.com/zK7dJxDwrI
Agreed. And unfortunately too bad that such a major player is blinded by its ignorance. Ah well more for the taking for @Tesla and other newcomers.

Another reason to support @Tesla and @elonmusk !
There is and there will be always doubt for growth company like @Tesla .There were a lot of doubt for Apple as well. Just look at how Apple grew since IPO. History of Tesla has just begun and nobody knows how big it can grow.
Hey @AnnieGaus , you must realize that your clickbait influences people, and slows, even if slightly, this transition to renewable energy. My children want to have a life too, shame on you. Love you @mayemusk , this is all you, we support you, you rock. Go @Tesla !! #climatechange

@elonmusk / @Tesla @apple seems to care a bit also
Not sure about the planet deal but it will definitely be a fun show to watch Hillary lose again. By then we all hope @elonmusk has been able to recover total control of @Tesla & provide anyone who is willing the chance to own one of his cars. So far he is the only serious.
We need a timer to stop the climate when the goal is to just refresh the air in the car, is it possible? and when I turn off climate from the app, the climate stays off even when we enter the car next day @elonmusk @Tesla BTW we LOVE the autopilot pic.twitter.com/9HS6b8MEnu
Whoah. It look like the Tesla app was (temporarily?) showing me someone else's referral account and stats. It think the app is back to normal but the Web site still has the wrong stats. @Tesla
45% is a good number for @Tesla This is what @elonmusk want
me n my eife were discussing getting a @Tesla model 3 n the autopilot feature came up. the question was, "is the autopilot capable of neighborhood driving, like stop signs, lights, n speed bumps ?" if any has an answer that would be great, thanks. @elonmusk #TeslaModel3
Dear @elonmusk and @tesla - I've referred 13 Tesla vehicle sales since I became an owner in April. Today, my Powerwall 2, unveiling event invitation and wall charger awards disappeared from the Loot box before I had a chance to claim them. What's up with that?
Takes more than calling them out; reporters expect that when they publish. @elonmusk and @Tesla need additional public relations and education efforts to help mitigate negative articles.
@Tesla Today (11/12), I seen for the first time, a Model 3. This was on Hiawasse Rd. in Orlando, FL. It was black and looked absolutely stunning. Photos and videos don't do it justice. Great job!
Because only people that get scared easy sell. When you look at the numbers (which a factual) you see @Tesla gaining market share and presence on the streets.

@Tesla @elonmusk Please please get back to me. I could really use the 1000$ Tesla owes me. Furnace is broken, it's cold, and I have 2 children, a 3 year old and 2 weeks old. I trusted Tesla. It has been over 5 months since the refund request. I called many many times. Nothing!
Investment idea: buy real estate in expensive but noisy and polluted areas (e.g. most CBDs). When electric cars take off, those will have the highest appreciation. You profit regardless of whether @Tesla or the traditional manufacturers come out on top.
@Tesla self driving teslas with long following distances will reduces stops on highways during rush hour. Reduce stops equals improve traffic
Oh, and I'd like it to not have a massive and distracting tablet in the middle of it that encourages drivers to take their eyes off the road and kill me with their metal box of @Tesla .

@elonmusk when will @Tesla release a V9 version which can be rolled out in Switzerland?
I always boast how my @Tesla is always so cutting edge with its software updates; however, I have to tip my hat to @vw for support of Siri Shortcuts in its Car-Net iOS app. @elonmusk I want to Siri to open my M3 doors! :)
Just cause I'm in a bit of a ranting mood. Fascinating that @VW can announce EV's and it's treated like a fact when it is vaporware. There's no product yet! And even though they committed massive fraud on emissions it is @Tesla whose credibility is questioned...
Right? And when @GM gives the bolt more than a token attention whore look at me I have 1 EV on the lot, True fact 2012 @Ford had a focus ev. Though I could never order it that's why ultimately I got a @Tesla . Danny @JIMFALKMAUI couldn't get the Ford EV.
Thank YOU for being our guide and councillor @trevorpage ! Your videos and forum are helping all of us, giving us access to @Tesla #Model3 information which we otherwise had to seek for. So you've earned that Roadster, without doubt. Congratulations, enjoy and be happy!

..Not only do other companies have their own brand of tequila but Elon [joke or no joke about a liquor name] OBVIOUSLY used @Tesla name which IS using a 2018 'mark' and IS in MANY countries and would therefore have more right to use the word tesla with tequila in "Teslaquila".

Still think that for those interested, @Tesla could save money by offering an option to fly buyers to the factory for direct delivery. No shipping. Perfect paint. I bet many would jump at the chance to see the factory, pick up their new Model 3 and road trip home.

@Tesla slashed prices on home solar system to spur sales

@Tesla @elonmusk this is so awesome to see. Would love to see you guys help out Paradise, CA in their rebuilding efforts and getting power back to them. Since all homes built will require solar, 90% of the town will have that and may not need a traditional power grid.

Does anyone know why "Full Autopilot" is no longer a #model3 option on the @Tesla website? When I ordered, there were "enhanced autopilot" and "full autopilot" options. I opted for "enhanced" for now and would purchase "full" later if it came to fruition but now it doesn't exist?

IMO @tesla could get there, at least in a best case scenario. This would involve: 1st: creating a 20 kWh low entry version of such sexy beasts as the Model 3/Y; this would destroy the Competition in the $25k range; 2nd: selling that car in each village where VW is selling theirs.

4/4 But I stretched to buy a great car and to support and sustain a great company. I sincerely love what @Tesla stands for and how people are not only enjoying the cars, but getting behind the company and @elonmusk . I hope people stick to that.
And very nice to meet you Victoria - you were wonderful @Tesla representative. Thank you for the test drive, sorry about the 96 mph. #fast

Is there anyway to make an electronic grill that works as well as a charcoal or propane grill?! This would be a blessing to everyone that lives in an apartment that can't have anything but electronic. @elonmusk can we get a @Tesla grill?
It just needs an engineer to figure out how to make the Model X in Lego .. Probably many would have bought it if it had excisted.. @Tesla @LEGO_Group @LEGOIdeas #lego #tesla
The best part my wife took this picture now she is 100% @Tesla fan. And before she never cared about cars
Someday you should play "Don't stop me know" - Queen in one of your missions, it would be a perfect match. @elonmusk @SpaceX @Tesla

@elonmusk @Tesla In Africa doing safari.Wonder EV is much more suitable rather than traditional lamdrover/landcruiser - silent not to scare games away, no emmison in reserves, inst torque for terrain, super sunny good for solar, save costs for transporting gas to the wild.

Yup-who would have envisioned buying an $80,000 RC car? @teslamaritimes @tesla @elonmusk LOVE IT!!! pic.twitter.com/NaN5nIc9RF
Tiamat, my @Tesla Model 3 just clicked past 4,000 miles. No car will make driving in stop-and-go traffic pleasant, but autopilot makes it a whole lot less stressful. It is a pleasure to take the wheel and silently sneak up on people in the parking garage, though... pic.twitter.com/PdgEYldgo3
@MKBHD do you plan on sharing the footage from your Tesla from the accident? Sorry to hear it happened. Your insurance company will probably wanna total it but @tesla themselves probably won't.
