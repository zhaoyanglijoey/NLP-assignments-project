@Tesla I hate version 9 I want version 8 back. Hate the navigation screen on all the time. I like my split screen. You have made my driving experience extremely annoying. I bought a car I enjoyed. Now I have a car that is non user friendly. Do you want to lose customers?
@elonmusk Yo, @Tesla is it like this? pic.twitter.com/wlLRgTqk3K
@elonmusk My humble wish list: @Tesla based #ModelY + platform ready for customized Class B #RV #CamperVan #MobileOffice . (Just like a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter platform for Bus/RV, only electric based, and much much better and making more sense in all design aspects). Thank you!
Does being a @TeslaSolar customer give you any preference in the @Tesla model 3 queue? @elonmusk that would be awesome for me as I can't wait for the car and already have Tesla solar panels on our house
Would have loved to have wireless charging built into the phone dock out of the box. Most people buying @Tesla are technology enthusiasts and own latest phones that support Qi standard charging

@Tesla @elonmusk house full at Burlington, NJ supercharger right now ... Only model X and S so not sure what happens when Model 3 picks up. I have seen at most 3 stations used that too rarely. Wow ... However I'm surprised that my X is charging at 104 kW (308 mi/hr).
Yep, fully understand @Tesla have not done this deliberately, but believe in their #tech /brand appeal, and rightfully so! My friend paid his deposit on a #Tesla #Model3 2 years ago. Don't think I could be that patient?

Seems my dual motor performance @Tesla 3 is already ready to deliver this week! Guess I'll have 2 for a little while. Probably keep commuting in my current one until I get the hov stickers for the new one - saves me an hour or more per week.
Feature & Easter Egg Idea: It'd be cool if the vehicle realized you were at a legal race track through a geofence and upon entry unlocked track mode and other performance driving related features like tuning the aggressiveness of regen, steering, timers, etc. @Tesla @elonmusk
Did a rough cost/benefit analysis for our first week with our @Tesla Model 3 EV. We spent an additional $9.04 in electricity compared to the week before (with our gas car). That's ~$40/month to power our electric vehicle. We spent $270 on gas last month. You do the math. pic.twitter.com/wF0MTgVGH5

@Tesla @elonmusk any chance of bringing back ULCS? I want to order a model 3.
This is why I get my @tesla news from reasonable sources who make criticisms when criticisms are due, but have the ability to look past the need for click bate journalism and create a reputation based on something more substantial. I watch @HyperChangeTV , and make money.
"deceptive" how? Bottom line is that according to @Tesla the M3 drive system is designed/validated (ie. tested to) withstand 1M miles of driving (ie. is ultra high endurance!) Perhaps he could have said "tested" vs. "driving" but this difference is immaterial to the core claim.

I'd love for @Tesla to offer test drives in my area over the winter, just to demonstrate the ability of the Model 3. Would make buying one easier as I wouldn't need a dual motor model.

Bet my bottom dollar that @Tesla 's mid range Model 3 has the same battery as the long range model, but software locked. Mic drop move. Gets more bums on seats, nudges short range buyers across the line, and opens up lots of opportunities for upsales @FredericLambert @elonmusk
@Tesla @elonmusk When the majority of cars are driverless, will they all move to the side of the road simultaneously when an emergency vehicle is trying to get through? This would seem like an amazing advantage and life-saving feature especially for latge cities. #future #cars
So you have a lot of extra time to reddit and tweet...has Alvarez & Marsal taken over @Tesla yet? How's the re-org going? What are you planning to do with the $450 million your company transfered last week? $ tsla => $ tsla . Ch11 tonight?
Think of the people shopping for a Bolt Premier or a nicely optioned Leaf. They can spend a few thousand more and get a @Tesla with more range and more charging options. $4k will bring more people into the @Tesla family.
Why does @elonmusk tweet so much, but @Tesla doesn't offer any support on Twitter? Seems like so many companies are great at social media support while Tesla owners spend hours on hold to talk to a person. Something doesn't add up here. #Model3
Q4 will be huge regardless. This is approaching Chevy Bolt Premier cost. Spend a few more and get a @Tesla #Model3 .
Wait, what? The #Model3 mid range battery? Where did THAT a one from???? @Tesla @elonmusk
@ArkansasState can we please get a handful of @Tesla Destination Charging stations installed so that my family and I can make the trip there for a game and still get back home to Little Rock??

It was February, 2018 when she filed complaints through your online platform. #SinceLastNovember even a @Tesla made it to #space thanks to @SpaceX , but you have failed to reply to a complaint. Cc: @ElonMusk
@Tesla there is a lot of confusion in the forums about preconditioning the #model3 battery. Can you clarify - how to do it & how long it takes? At work I plug into a level 1 plug & I warm the cabin from the app 10 mins before leaving. Does that trigger battery preconditioning?

@Tesla @elonmusk Hope you continue to enjoy the upstart novelty factor. Dreadful cust. service on pre-order refunds will discourage the potential customers you will need for scale #itsnotaboutthemoney
So dope. Happened across this on the YouTubes, so excited that a newer option has been introduced. Almost approaching the countdown to my order soon. #Tesla #Model3 @Tesla pic.twitter.com/BVMZvY8hL0

@elonmusk @tesla Any ETA on Carbon spoiler delivery for M3 Performance with Performance package owners? No complaints for waiting but an ETA would be nice.

. @Tesla just released their cheapest #Model3 yet. http:// bit.ly/2OANBVw
@tracyminajjjjj has a @Tesla car how lit
But then I could buy a @Tesla roadster. And maybe book a trip around the moon with @SpaceX . The moon trip especially would make me happy.
@elizabeth_werth You are misreading @tesla 's statement re: delivery for the mid-range. The quoted statement is regarding the "standard" battery (the $35k version that isn't released yet) - the mid-range released yesterday is delivery in 6-10 weeks, not 4-6 months. pic.twitter.com/YBaV0MgoBw
Many of his engineers have worked with him firm for years, @Molliway @browningash @RocketJoy / Just watch any rocket launch and see MANY happy employees. I haven't followed @Tesla employees much but Elon is the same person at both places. How they pull the impossible!
Also don't forget that two manufacturing exec left in 2016 soon after #Model3 was introduced. Elon has asked production planning to be updated due the overwhelming reservation and he probably ended up doing it himself. Yep @Tesla is successful because of Elon.

It's #FridayPollDay on #AutonomousCars with @MarcHoag ! Today's question: If you own -- or plan to get -- a @Tesla , how much of your decision was/is due to #Autopilot ? #AutonomousVehicles #cars #tech #tesla @ElonMusk #elonmusk #driverless @TeslaMotorsClub
@Tesla is just a front so @elonmusk can build Transformers. Wake up sheeple.
I went to customize the Tesla 3 on the @Tesla website. It looked damn good too. Went to buy it and then realized that I am in college. One day though I gotchu @elonmusk lol
@OptionsAction if you're talking value and risk on the upside and downside why the belief that @tesla has more downside wouldn't the risk be not going long at this price point given the trading range ?
From @Reuters - @Tesla and @GM have lobbied Congress to lift a cap on EVs eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. On Thursday, Sen. @DeanHeller proposed legislation that would lift the current cap on EVs eligible for credits. https:// rtoinside.ly/2OxOVbL pic.twitter.com/wIbWkbouuB
@elonmusk Thoughts on designing a line of @Tesla motorcycles?
Humanity's greatest soldier. A meme tweeting, anime watching billionaire. Thank you for giving us a glimpse into the future. Full support for the people at @SpaceX @Tesla @solarcity and all the other projects where people are working hard!!
@Tesla the model 3 is crazy omllll
@elonmusk @Tesla just ordered my first Tesla in Pearl White today. Will I get it before Dec 31 in Washington DC ? Order#RN109196076. It would be nice if you could throw in a Tesla hat for free.
I'm not just buying a Tesla when I win this $1 billion #MegaMillions jackpot, I'm buying @Tesla
@elonmusk @Tesla looks like the short shorts keep winning! Could @Tesla be the next GE ... time will tell
@elonmusk @tesla @BMWUSA Tesla, on the model 3 Performance, can you offer a few really unique/exclusive colors and some carbon fiber options? Performance should be more distinct from the basic versions. (think M3) it's much different than a typical 335
I would buy #Tesla #modelx for my whole family. Hopefully @Tesla would give me all the referral goodies still.
Fantastic news... but is that Right Hand Drive any closer to being ready? #Model3 @Tesla
@elonmusk @tesla Tesla, Why don't you offer higher margin Dual motor and Performance in Europe or other markets now? Better for profits than lower adding lower range in USA.
@Tesla I was just on hold waiting for a customer service specialist for 30 minutes and was hung up on... Called back & now the wait time is 40+ mins. Seriously!?!?
@elonmusk @tesla Tesla, Why don't you offer higher margin Dual motor and Performance in Europe or other markets now? Better for profits than lower adding lower range in USA.
/THREAD If the media continues to leverage the primitive reptilian parts of our brains with clickbait headlines that slant the truth against @Tesla , then they will indeed be heavily responsible for sending humans back to a more primeval state of human existence. $ TSLA pic.twitter.com/6vj9jFSYS0
The fact that @Tesla stock *dropped* when @elonmusk announced that the $35k Model 3 is now a reality is precisely why he wanted to take the company private. Wasn't the big objection that @tesla couldn't get there?
@elonmusk do you think you might be able to do a ticket to Mars give away if you purchase a @Tesla Willy Wonka golden ticket style?
The delivery process for my @Tesla Model 3 has been painful. I first got notice that the car had arrived in Dedham MA US over six weeks ago, but I don't have the car yet. At one point they told me it had to be sent to the shop for some "paint repair". And their voicemail is full.
should I just say fuck it and buy a @Tesla already so I can stop drooling every time I see one in public @elonmusk

@Tesla Trying to reach Chicago VillaPark Service Center for a while @630- 415-3124 and while trying to leave a message it states that the voicemail box is full and cannot accept more messages! Anyway to contact a live agent? Waiting on updates for damage at the time of delivery!
Preferably via official @Tesla announcement that covers all details in one piece, instead of individual short tweets/replies that can be abused by misinformation campaign
Sorry @Tesla . 75 weeks of waiting and not a single update. Money back please. pic.twitter.com/RWk6EoZwQg

@elonmusk @Tesla are we Indian customers going to see launch of Tesla cars in coming years
The more @Tesla 's charging at a supercharging station, the slower it goes for everyone it seems. It's ridiculous its priced per minute and not based on energy intake. The S and X can charge faster from what I understand. Is it just because it's illegal to resell energy? @elonmusk

No I had to unfollow them on everything because of their nonstop negative bias. Literally everything they post. They should have to put it in BOLD the same size as the title font, that they have a SHORT position on @Tesla

Dear @Tesla and @elonmusk , I missed the autopilot trial after they cancelled / delayed delivery on my performance model 3 due to missing parts / panels. Any other trials comming soon? Can I ask customer services about it? Thanks!

@elonmusk @tesla : Solar energy storage can be achieved by plugging in Tesla batteries that are already in Tesla cars to solar panels during sunlight, which for most people is at work parking lots during sunlight. Tesla Energy could spur the provision of work solar charging.
@Tesla @elonmusk are you aware of the issues in your customer service department? Numerous emails went unanswered or significantly delayed, long wait time on phone call to your delivery dept. Great products need great service to be sustainable. I support Tesla but also frustrated
