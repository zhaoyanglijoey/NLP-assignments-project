Nice, The feature was delivered by Mr. Musk back in 2014! Looks like it is still in alpha. Get it repaired before @Tesla goes bankwupt.
@elonmusk @Tesla what's the point of having roadside assistance if we have to wait for more than an hour on hold and no one receiving the call at the end? Why would anyone call back when we receive this kind of customer service? Please HELP!!! #NewCar #15daysold #Model3
@Tesla Hi, I just wanted to send you this video. We visited the Tesla showroom in Knutsford last weekend and we saw the X SUV whilst in there. My children were absolutely amazed by it! My son then decided he wanted to make one out of @Lego so here it is!! pic.twitter.com/ZQIsymyki1
TY @TeslaCanuck TY @CrashAniStudios TY @InsideEVs TY @Tesla & @elonmusk Maybe Tesla could dig up AI telemetry, I wonder if they could already know when such evasive actions were taken, does the car store some amount of raw video? Always want to see it how the car saw the event.
So, if @Tesla users wanted to be truely green, they could really do with one of our generators to charge their cars from.. added benefit, you can power your house/business too.. Trucks?! We can supply power to those chargers too :)
@elonmusk Does @Tesla own the battery technology or is it Panasonic? or Both?

looks like the new @Tesla model has arrived #TeslaMotors
Look at the sign... looks like he has generic parking rights for up to 30 minutes... be mindful of other drivers and their rights to park any vehicle at select Superchargers around the world... @Tesla has to conform to agreements it made in getting locations hosted.

It is interesting that stock analysts are lowballing @Ford when they have money in the bank, but @Tesla is a media darling in spite of not delivering cars that were paid for last year. Is this #ProgressiveEconomics ? Someone ask @Ocasio2018
To all the analysts saying that Apple should be acquiring Tesla, just remember that Tesla is sitting on a massive $10.7 billion of debt! Plus its CEO Elon Musk is highly unpredictable. @elonmusk @Tesla $ aapl $ tsla
Would a alien species landing on the moon see the flag and think good jod America or good job humans? Imagine what they must think of us when they see the @Tesla roadster floating around space. #SundayMorning
Who says that @Tesla has a 75% defect rate? BTW: Jaguar CEO just said that batteries will be their bottle neck wrt electric cars. Advantage for @Tesla : Gigafactory. It will take all other OEMs many years and tons of money to catch up.

Agree that the rules forbid change direction under breaking. BUT....rules are killing sportsmanship and competitiveness. If the point is to avoid crashes, then ask @Tesla a hand.
Bulls will say this is the exception and so therefore Bears are just spreading FUD. This is a real customer issue and service complaint. If true, @Tesla should do something about it. $ TSLA $ TSLAQ
I encourage @FredericLambert / @ElectrekCo to get on board with prioritizing the longer term of @Tesla over shorter term targets, as a few thousand more or less Model 3's produced in Q3 has *zero impact* on the intrinsic value of $ TSLA , but nearsightedness harms #Tesla & investors.
@elonmusk @Tesla I think you should add a chime to indicate doors have locked when you put the car into drive or reverse. :) Just a suggestion.
. @elonmusk @Tesla big fan but my M3 delivery experience sucked! Planned everything to get it delivered on 31st aug- wife's bday. They called 45 mins in advance, not delivering today, come back on 2nd sep. Went 8am today, waited 90 mins, same paint issue, come back after a week

ABSOLUTELY! Pre-owned @Tesla is option (eg, friend selling 2012 Model S for $39K) Model 3 $35K base in 2019. I don't know about your garage situation, but plenty of owners manage without garages. All u need is desire 4 it. Costs of ownership lower than a gas car so can factor in.
@Tesla when and were will the first mega charger be? Will it be the same port as the S X and 3
@elonmusk I fancy about 'not' a flamethrower fitted @Tesla model.
I read your paper and found it very interesting. My question is; being a Neuroscientist and post-doc in Stroke research do I have the slightest chance of ever having my own @Tesla along with a dedicated garage for it? :)

And also by the way, nobody has made a better electric car or car of any kind than @Tesla and @elonmusk . Not even close. Not even on the same planet.
The man who repairs his own @Tesla car, makes an excellent point. No schematics, no repair manual - which means you are stuck with them after warranty. Something to think about #ElectricCars https:// youtu.be/KBcfQNMR180

I just used @NissanUSA 's comparison tool, to see how the Leaf stacks up against competitors. I find it quite amusing how @Tesla is unavailable for comparison. Telling.

hey @elonmusk @Tesla When are the day1 res holders going to see a non-PUP interior available? I don't want the base model, as I want LR and potentially AWD. The longer you wait to answer this, the more likely you'll lose customers before the Fed Incentive runs out.
They won't put @Tesla out of business, it connects with its buyers the way @Apple does with no logic but they will get all the other that just want a good EV
The people running the numbers and paying attention to traditional finance rules are as pissed off seeing @Tesla with big factories, pumping out cars, employing thousands of people as the pollsters and DC insiders were watching the Trump victory speech on election night.
@Tesla now promotes environmentally friendly #FrunkComposting .

Agreed. They will learn the hard way that you simply cannot convert & expect efficiency. It's a whole new ball-game. @elonmusk & @Tesla made it look easy, but that's due to his extreme devotion & commitment to his vision. It's exciting to see that the Big Guns are following suit!

@JustinTrudeau @fordnation has cancelled the #OntarioEVRebate in such a way that future @Tesla owners get burned. What is your government going to do to ensure those who ordered still get some sort of rebate? #ONPoli #2019Election
no sorry. Future already has a name, its called @Tesla and its being delivered to customers already. How about releasing more than press releases? Maybe, you know, a car?
@elonmusk @Tesla I will eventually get a Model S. I swear. So please do not stop producing them in the next 30 - 45 years. That's how long I think it'll take me to get the money.
Guess what!? OUR TESLA MODEL 3 GOT DELIVERED TODAY AND IT IS BEYOND AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! Thank you @Tesla @elonmusk #Happy pic.twitter.com/yad8TWvhtm
From a 17 year olds perspective, I genuinely think @Tesla is the way forward for cars, hearing about Tesla genuinely gets me excited because its like "Oh I wonder what they have done now" "Newspaper: Tesla has created a car that can drive on water, we don't need bridges."
@Tesla roadster me please...
@Tesla is #1! Not only did @ChelseaAllen drive our Model X back to us after getting some repairs done this evening after work an hour away, the Tesla team did up a birthday card and everyone signed it for our daughter's birthday today. Thank you #teslafamily @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/ZJ2zZiaJVD
@elonmusk @Tesla I got the (tentative) delivery email... Ohmygod!, Ohmygod!, Ohmygod!, Ohmygod!
@elonmusk @PsyonixStudios @RocketLeague @Tesla Waiting for that Tesla DLC. Make it happen, you wont! (PLEASEEEEE) LIKE AND RT SO THEY CAN SEE IT!!
They don't like it when you mistake their @astonmartin for a @Tesla ..
Sooooo...my @Tesla Model 3 Performance delivery window was Oct. 18th - Dec 18th. I was really hoping I'd have it in time for Thanksgiving. They called me today and said it's ready for me to pick up on Tuesday. I'm guessing their production issues are pretty well resolved.
6) You can really see a lot of the traditional car manufacturers jumping on the electric car train. Don't fool yourself though, without @Tesla much of what's happening now, wouldn't be happening at all. They put high-end market pressure on luxury car makers.
Now that's a true @Tesla family! When I join the ranks it will be with a Model X.
Funny how I have a job interview in Chicago and LITERALLY EVERYONE FOLDS LMAO @elonmusk @Tesla ...NO ONE ASK ME FOR SHIT EVER. I CANT STAND THIS SHIT.
Have @Tesla got any marked RHD Police Cars for them to trial?
@elonmusk and that would be a great present and appreciation for us smaller budget Die hard @Tesla and @elonmusk supporters.
Before I was hit by a semi I liked my car. Post semi strike still walking I really do like the safety of the @Tesla .

Just imagine the repair bills for those cars, once they get delivered to unhappy customers. Mismatched paint etc. QA expenses can gobble operating margin improvement. Bonds are still mid-80s. Gross margins for @Tesla do not equate to $ F or $ GM . Debt is paid with FCF not NI.
@Tesla Is it possible to charge a Tesla off the 3 phase 400V connections found on most construction sites?
@Tesla , this would be more useful than quoting someone's sales projections. And, the company should be issuing additional capital. I would reduce debt by at least a third, and another broken promise to customers, may result in an additional class-action lawsuit. Something should
They fine the company. That's it. This is a bullsh_t lawsuit that's just another FUD attack. I hope @Tesla counter sues the hell out of them!!!
We need more. Even @CNBCFastMoney doesn't seem to believe skyrocketing @Tesla sales while all others are in decline. Even think the compliance EV's from Germany will kill Tesla. Denial abounds. $ TSLA #Tesla

Hey, Tesla, winter's coming soon and we need a ski rack for our Model 3. No one has anything that can work yet. Thule has no idea how to attach our relatively new one. Any news? @elonmusk @Tesla
@elonmusk @Tesla Do we maybe need a Tesla Shooting Brake in the US. Let's not call it a wagon. Put air ride on it that raises it 4" if you keep it below 25mph. You know for those steep driveways and small off road jaunts.
I just wanna be able to buy a @Tesla one day.
Not really. Its monetizing the assets and capabilities they have. They have the shareholder's wealth to maximize. It was for this reason @elonmusk wanted to take @Tesla private: avoid the breakneck pressure to maximize shareholder as the expense of innovation.

Elon (and Sandy Munro) also stated that every single aspect of a vehicle to be made by robots needs to be designed for robots. Does that mean a super boring #ModelY if @Tesla is still on that path or are we years away from that level of manufacturing?

Wat een kolder. @Tesla produceert 5.000 M3's per maand, reviews zijn zeer positief. 300.000 mensen willen graag wachten op hun auto. Musk zelf is bijna failliet geweest omdat hij zijn totale vermogen in Tesla/SpaceX investeerde. Je hebt werkelijk geen idee waar je het over hebt

If @GM were smart, and they structured the debt in their favor, they buy the controlling shares of @Tesla to secure their private status and absorb them.
Is @Tesla still going to drug test employees?
This whole hullabaloo has created the mother of all @Tesla stock buying opportunities. @elonmusk is getting harassed by the media at this point.

The important thing to note here is the recovery rate for any @tesla that is stolen is very high.
@elonmusk @Tesla Tesla Board - do you not have a backbone?
Interesting perspective on @Tesla Model 3 comes from my mom, aged - well I better not say but lets just say that WWII is something she was alive for - who just took delivery. (1) She is super excited to have it because she can hear people talk in the car (she wears hearing aids).

Didn't know Ewon had a monopoly on luxury EVs (Ewon thinks moats are "lame). Would agree people like cars to be safe and inexpensive to operate, but @tesla is neither. Thanks for the warning. If it were from fe-lon ("short burn of century"), I'd short more.
If @Tesla shareholders listened to the content of the @joerogan pod, instead of watching a 10 second manufactured clip from the news, there stocks would have increased. @elonmusk is a genius, and a great dude.

@elonmusk or @Tesla sound systems other engineers, Model 3 can use music equalizer pre-sets or custom memory slots for different types of music. Can we get that added? Different configurations, are best way to listen to different types of music. Great sound every time I adjust.
Some are already in Electric Motorbike game (as per Zero, linked below) - is @Tesla considering entering that market in the future? I ask because the Asian motorcycle market is massive in comparison to US, and Asian Gigafactory could produce it. @elonmusk https://www. zeromotorcycles.com/ca/
