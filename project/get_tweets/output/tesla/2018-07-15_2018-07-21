Irrelevant. The program existed and continues to be utilized by Ontarians across the province, except for those who bought @Tesla . @ONtransport needs to make this right and live up to the promises they made to middle class families, or they will lose all goodwill and trust.

No, I have definitely seen that guy at the @Tesla store
@elonmusk what a dick! Supports House Republicans and calling legitimate heroes pedophiles. This family will never own anything @Tesla
Pretty sure @tesla cars explode with far less regularity than those powered by a non-renewable incendiary liquid.

Between being revealed as a major Republican Donor to keep the House Republican and accusing the Top Cave Diver/Rescue Expat Hero in the Thai Cave drama a Paedophile, @elonmusk seems to be self-destructing...Time to Boycott @Tesla ?

Hey @elonmusk , If I disagree with the sat nav in a @Tesla will it call me a pedo too? Did you take recent lessons in how to commit business suicide? Was it all going so well that you thought it was time to fuck up your shareholders? Yours, A former wannabe-Tesla-driver. pic.twitter.com/JOfqiOKRLy
@Tesla Sorry guys, your boss is a jack ass. Yep, I mean the "Brit Thai diver bullying". End of my interest in your moonshot.
He may get sued for defamation, but yes I still do. Youd rather @elonmusk just roll over and accept this guy's proclamation that he's an idiot who makes things that are unworkable? PS - I don't own any @Tesla products.
HOLY SHT. One of the brightest btches I've ever known quit her job w @tesla a few weeks ago, only a few weeks after being recognized for closing the most contracts in N. America... Fck the GOP! ELON IS FCKING DEAD TO ME.
@RachelNotley @cathmckenna So I have convinced myself I might by a Tesla, for real.. the US has big incentives and rebates. What does Canada or Edmonton have? Thought being that you two are climate warriors, maybe you could tell me? @Tesla @CBCNews
@elonmusk denies giving the many racists in @gop money which only means he probably more than likely gave #gop money! Need more alternatives than just @Tesla making all electric vehicles!
Yes I had read that it was now part of @Tesla Tho I'm unsure of their mission statement but I know it is a tech co 1st then an energy co. I think everyone wonders how he does it. So this 'short' stock getting converted is NOT good. Is that part of the reason for the internal hack
@elonmusk @Tesla your true colors are showing, disgusting, calling someone who helped save the lives of kids while you played PR stunts a pedo, fuck you you rich sack of shit #ElonMusk #ElonMuskFacts #ElonExposed #Tesla #ThailandCaveRescue
Watch out for fakes. People looking to profit from short selling Tesla have moved to attacking @elonmusk rather than @Tesla They will likely reach a fevered pitch sometime this week. pic.twitter.com/Z11fB7quLl
Just happy to see the @Tesla Model S included next to the mock semi.
Ordered our @Tesla #ModelX online. Bring it, @elonmusk ! (Even though the byzantine laws in Wisconsin prevent delivery here and require us to go to Illinois to pick it up)
@elonmusk should change the name of his company from @tesla to TestMe because he seems to do some of his best work out of spite. Also, he makes shitty comments like this. pic.twitter.com/QLxGJZgp84
So I guess I don't ever get to own a @Tesla now. That kind of sucks. I get that lots of rich people donate to both sides, but this @elonmusk revelation is really disappointing.
I mean... @Tesla 's ARE fxxxxxg awesome. ...but still, you're right that they shouldn't receive corporate welfare. As should NO COMPANY.

Y'know, it's certainly not the exact same offence, but Papa John had built up much more social capital over far longer than Elon Musk and was forced to resign within days. @Tesla , @SpaceX , @boringcompany , etc. have to realize they'd be better off without a loose canon leader.

I think it's probably time for @elonmusk to consider stepping down as CEO at @Tesla Motors. Principally to get some sleep, but also to get some fresh perspective on the company's direction.
Why would @elonmusk refer to a the chief rescuer as a pedophile? WTF is wrong with you Musk? Maybe you should get your head examined. Losing respect for you daily. Think you are going off deep end due to @Tesla problems. Hating on everything.
Time for @Tesla to ditch the idiot @elonmusk
@elonmusk @Tesla Are you working with authorities to roll out new regulations for when cars are self-driving? Example: You should be able to text and ride/drink and ride but sex and driving will become a big problem

Re #environmentaljustice & communities of color: @joeganim - people don't ride bus by choice. They don't drive @Tesla cars.
@elonmusk @Tesla What kind of testing do you have for self-driving mode for extreme weather conditions? Coming from Canada a human knows when they should stop driving in the snow. What's going to tell the car it's too dangerous?
@elonmusk @Tesla When cars are full self-driving will they go speed limit or speed of traffic when on the roads? What about when the majority are self driving? Will cars essentially be going slower than now? Self driving won't break rules..people do. Should speed limits increase?
I had been on the fence, but this weekend, @ElonMusk made a persuasive case for canceling our Model 3 reservation. All the same, I hope @Tesla succeeds. I'm more of a cheapskate who will hold out for a good deal. Our 2015 Nissan Leaf ran us about $15k new. pic.twitter.com/OICad6YgaU
@elonmusk @Tesla What is your plan to summon vehicles if their parked underground? Most people in large cities live in condos and would be great to summon rather then having to walk underground. Also what incentives for developers to build underground charging for all spaces?
Re: direct sales of @Tesla @OzForGovCT - needs to consider dealers since Tesla doesn't do dealerships @joeganim - do electric city buses & school buses; not a big fan of Tesla not sure it's a good model. @NedLamont - yes. (he owns one) @rodforctgov - yes. Make business easier.
Out of the goodness of his heart, @elonmusk expedites his crew to build a submarine to rescue children and save lives. Some maroon claims he did it for publicity. #pathetic He owns @SpaceX and @Tesla if he needs free press, he tweets. This diver is a sad distraught individual.

@elonmusk @Tesla I have almost 4K miles on my Model 3 and have loved every mile! Wondering if you have plans to release a tow/roof bike rack.
@Tesla did your car-ship find any aliens yet?
@elonmusk @Tesla @Model3Owners @ElectrekCo Do we have possibility with the AWD model 3 to deactivate temporary the front motor just to burn a couple of tire ;)
Wonder if @elonmusk would do a @Tesla electric van. With e-commerce now being quite popular, the number of delivery vans has risen and probably will continue to do so. Converting vans to electric would cut down on their environmental impact.

#model3 @Tesla nice job on the 2170 battery cell. 20% larger but a 50% improvement is impressive.
What should @elonmusk do with his Twitter account? If you were on the board @Tesla would you ask Elon to...
My SR with integrated charge tank charges from 30% to 100% in about 40 minutes. I can go 150 miles. Hardly 1/3rd of a day. Charge networks *definitely* need to get better though. In my @Tesla I know where my next charge is, Zero not so much.
I really want to support @Tesla . Really really do. But then there is @elonmusk calling a #ThaiCaveRescue team member "pedo".
They won't ever boot @elonmusk , @Tesla is Stock is priced in completely to Elon's status and hype. Tesla stock goes to sub $50 with out Elon at the head.
@Tesla
@elonmusk Can @Tesla sell hubcap products for other car brands with the Tesla logo on? This help make other cars more efficient and sustainable for the planet until it's possible to purchase a Tesla.

Not sure that is 100% true. Look at the @Tesla use case. Automated everything. Realised that humans can still do some manual jobs better. Removed some of the automation. So you may see jobs partially but not necessarily fully automated.

@Tesla @elonmusk Feature request : Don't revert map in model 3 to north up after canceling out of navigation. Make it remember user preference (direction of travel in my case). Also save this preference as part of user profile. Wife likes north up, I like direction of travel.

I see @Tesla as a leader in helping us move to clean energy. They are pushing the other car companies to produce EVs. And mass production of EVs will lead to lower cost batteries which makes grid storage possible which in turn makes it possible to switch grid to solar & wind.

I would add an asterisk if it is true that @tesla has a re-work facility nearby, need to measure "flow" going to customers vs. in/out of re-work.
The expensive ones are being sold first so @tesla can raise the money that it needs to continue not being bankrupt. I imagine the cheaper baseline models will available once things are stabilized and there is money coming in for expansion. Perhaps this fall/winter.

Boom. It's here! My @Model3Tesla has finally arrived, and I could not love this thing enough. Spent the day doing "sure, I'll take you for a ride" trips for friends. A big thank you to the very friendly Dallas @Tesla team for welcoming me to the family. pic.twitter.com/SHOYvD2UVY
