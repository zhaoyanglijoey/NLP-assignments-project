Totally incredible!! Congrats @elonmusk and @Tesla ! Continually proving what others think is impossible is actually doable by applying knowledge, brains, fortitude, and perseverance. Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds -- Albert Einstein
Using ASPs of $40k for the Model 3, and $85k for Models S and X, @tesla now producing annual car sales in the $20 billion ballpark. Not too shabby. @themotleyfool
What a kick-ass team you have at @Tesla @elonmusk
Finally some love for $ TSLA everyone hates it just to prove their short analysis. Love @elon @Tesla
Can an electric @Jaguar outrace a @Tesla ? See for yourself here: http:// bit.ly/2KkWnF5 h/t @InsideEVs
I just received my email to customize my car! Can you tell me how many total @Tesla have been sold? Want to know if I am going to qualify for federal tax credit before I buy. Thanks!
@Tesla investor relations better define the term "factory gate" in the 10-Q, so @SEC_Enforcement can understand it $ TSLA
@elonmusk @tesla Please provide your definition of "factory gate". Without it gauging credibility of met prod goal is difficult.

'........It looks like a Honda' --my non #SiliconValley houseguest, re: @Tesla
WOOHOO! Congrats to you and @Tesla team
Brilliant to see the milestones being hit by innovating companies such as @Tesla . @elonmusk is really pioneering the way to a better and most definitely greener form of travel! #Tesla
Woot woot! Crushed my expectations in a very positive way. Great job @tesla !
And I bet it will take @Tesla less than 100 years to reach the same rates.
Day 18: @elonmusk I feel as though we are friends now and friends help each other out. So how about you help me out with that Model X and I'll promote the hell out of @Tesla ?
Congratulations @Tesla ! You guys are inspiring! You overcame all the FUD and negative news!
Good job. The naysayers were clearly wrong. @Tesla will meet customer demand for new vehicles!

@elonmusk , what do we have to do to get an official @Tesla electric motorcycle like Elastigirl's from the new #Incredibles2 pic.twitter.com/CHk81XqGES
By these numbers it looks like @Tesla makes more EVs in a month then Ford can do in an entire year. Correct me if I'm wrong.
@tesla : We like our #tesla model S so much, we just ordered our second car : it will be a model 3 ... thank you @tesla team and @elonmusk ... But will we have the same ultra white seats in model 3 ??? :D ... the best seats ever !!!
@Ford files for bankruptcy circa 2025 due to shift to EV's. @TeslaPodcast @Gfilche @Model3Owners @teslanomicsco @ElectrekCo @tesla @elonmusk
@Tesla Love my new Tesla. #2. Want to exchange my white mats for black mats. Can someone help me?
Mmm that's what I thought. No bias though, no bias. All I can say is well done @Tesla & @elonmusk & the whole team you all deserve a beer
Congrats and felt thank you to all the @tesla teams!!! Let the real short squeeze begin! All your hard work will pay off big time!
If @elonmusk and @Tesla can answer but one question today it must be this: have you sold 200,000 cars yet. Please just tell me that as my birthday present today!
Wait for the day when @elonmusk makes the @tesla Pickup and puts a @Ford in its back pic.twitter.com/b0LlHq01mb
@elonmusk at it again !! @Tesla team beat the 5000 cars per week mark by 2000. Short sellers going to have an eventful morning when trading starts!!!
Just passed a @Tesla model X on the highway; first one I have seen. It had Quebec license plates. It was doing 40mph in the passing lane (60mph limit). So even with the most technologically advanced vehicles on the road, Canadians still don't know how to drive in the USA.
Production line in a tent. Only @Tesla , only @elonmusk #Tesla #ElonMusk #Entrepreneurship lesson: whatever it takes, just do it.
Hey @elonmusk , when will we see a @Tesla superbike?
AMAZING!!! Congrats @Tesla team and @elonmusk !!!

Lesson of the day: ALWAYS BET on @elonmusk and @Tesla !! Congrats to everyone on the 5000 success!! #ElonMusk #Tesla #Model3
Awesome.. Great job @Tesla team! This is a significant milestone to world domination of electric vehicles.
Life goal: after I get my CompTIA A+ & network+ and a better job, get a @Tesla because what @elonmusk is doing is fantastic.

Thanks! It's actually @Tesla 15th birthday. It took them 15 years to figure out how to build a car.
Congrats @Tesla !
@elonmusk so now that @Tesla hits it's model 3 goal. What's next on the list of things to beat? Showing off model Y, Tesla truck or taking a day off to catch up on some needed sleep...
Thanks, @elonmusk and the @Tesla team!
@elonmusk I don't know much about cars, but I love everything about driving them, and I want to learn more, is internships @tesla a posibility?

Depends on what @elonmusk end goal is. Make Tesla a top 5 global automaker? Not gonna happen. Push humanity away from fossil fuels through EVs, while building a reputable niche car company a la Porsche? Definitely well on his way given impact @Tesla having on all major automakers
7,000 * 4,416 = 30,912,000 battery cells 30,912,000 / (7*86,400) = 51 battery cells / second 7*86,400 / 7,000 = A new model 3 every 86.4 seconds Team @Tesla rocks!

Just waiting for the @Tesla 3
@elonmusk it's great that you smashed your production goal but changing the world for the better is already a goal that you have smashed since the inception of @Tesla & @SpaceX I don't care what anybody says we need more progressive geniuses like you in this world, thank you sir! pic.twitter.com/VfmgEHuoFM
The founding of @Tesla was the beginning of the end of the internal combustion engine. This is the moment the world will look back on as the time that became obvious to all.
Congrat @elonmusk and @Tesla . Looking forward to my AWD Model 3!
. @Tesla your recent map updates (colorless) are a step backwards. I assume this was motivated by the cellular data savings, and you are trying to call it an "improvement in clarity". It's pretty terrible. Want old maps back.

@elonmusk If @Tesla is in the best position to determine, track, study, and manage stats (on accidents, part failures, etc.), then isn't Tesla in a good position to offer insurance exclusively for its cars? Such a constant cap influx / float would also be great for Tesla, no?

@Tesla so I walk up to my trunk, and it unlocks every time, but then when I walk to open my car door right after, that is always locked, and asking me to tap #model3
LOL! @ford is making the cars of the 20th century, whereas @Tesla is making the cars of the 21st century. That is why I waited for 2 years to get my #model3 and I why never even pondered buying a Ford.

@Tesla service pushed an update to my car this morning to address my AC complaints from a few days ago. So far so good after 1.5 hours of continual operation. Pretty awesome they were able to diagnose and address this remotely.
Something just broke off and bounced around under my car driving down the highway. Only 5-6 more months until I get my @Tesla , you can make it baby!
@Ford $26 billion loan saving them from bankruptcy, still brags about making more cars than @Tesla lmfao
@elonmusk I got an amazing idea about making flying cars, something @Tesla should invest in, trust me it's incredible
@StevenArmstrong It took ford how many years to be able to make 7000 cars in 4 hours. While Tesla is on track not only nail that but blow it out of the water in a shorter time frame. Hitting 7000 cars in 4 hours should be @Tesla Goal to make @Ford eat crow. Go @elonmusk
As a reminder for everyone freaking out about the thought of @Tesla reaching the 200K milestone and starting the Federal tax credit phase out, remember it is an income tax CREDIT not a discount or rebate - it doesn't lower the cash price of an EV http:// bit.ly/2KFQs9C pic.twitter.com/C11rAAdM2A
I just decided my favorite car is a @Tesla
@elonmusk @Tesla just got off the phone with an advisor. When I ordered my car, there was a 4-8 week delivery window. I'm now told I might have to wait 3-5 months. Hugely concerning; Ontario $14K rebate goes away by the end of the summer. Please, please, please help me.

Hey @elonmusk This is what my Son did in his #Toyota a few days ago. How would the Tesla react if it was going around a corner and a car was coming at it in the same lane? Could a @Tesla car have avoided the accident? pic.twitter.com/C27p4HwDz2
I wonder if @Tesla @elonmusk could start making airport ground support equipment? Integrated power cart & tug, compressor/start carts with electric driven compressors, cargo loaders, etc. As fleets age out, this could be an opportunity to decrease CO2 from airports.

I'm probably really late to the game here @DrLupoOnTwitch , but has anyone suggested an official name for your @Tesla yet? If not, my vote goes to The Lupmobile. (Pronounced "Lupe-mobile") Used in a sentence: "Today on a fine Midwestern road, The Lupmobile did #AllTheWork ."

Nobody likes smugness. @Tesla have made a huge achievement there. @elonmusk is coming for you.
It was essential to hit 5000 mark now, but the turnover only happens when @Tesla starts to make $ end of Q3.

The gians of today and dinasours of tomorrow smiling cynically ... hmmm reminds me of good old Nokia. The german companies already understood the importance of EV market and are pushing hard and respect Tesla. And you Ford still smiling on your glorious past? Go @Tesla
Thank you @elonmusk for my @Tesla #Model3 , picked up Sunday and loving it. Having been all electric for almost 5 years, now is the first time I am more concerned about my phone battery running out of charge and not my car !
But only after giving them a fair chance. As long as @Tesla keeps innovating as every company must do I can confidently state that TSLA prices are going to Mars! (20/20)
But we still must ask constant questions to ensure the highest quality of products are delivered. Through the market process and through this incredible thing known as capitalism, @Tesla has reached this stage. If Tesla can't do it then they deserve to fall to the wayside (19/20)
This is all public, I've put my name on this though I haven't been wrong before in trading and I'll be damned if I start now. @Tesla represents some of the greatest innovation in America in a largely stagnant industry. Some can't recognise it (18/20)
Also, I'm staking my (young) reputation on this claim. Immediate recovery by end of the month, by Q2 2019 @Tesla will be profitable. Producing 10,000+ a week. It will start mass producing a renewable charging network and the stock price will be around $400 by Q3 2019. (17/20)
Unfortunately, the shorts won out because they spun 5K production as being a fluke. Since we don't have future production numbers they're technically right, and the market being insanely reactive did its movements. With $3000 in remaining capital I'm putting it in @Tesla (16/20)
So let's talk about the future. This market sell-off hurt me, I'm in a paper trading competition with my friend and my portfolio is down $1500 and I'm ok with that. This was another attempt by the short sellers to drag down @Tesla on any news it could make concerning. (15/20)
Also, the criticism over the autopilot is mind-boggling. Regular people have accidents all the time, but of course, the short sellers will focus on @Tesla when there's a very rare accident and blow that out of proportion. Progress requires persistent experimentation. (14/20)
Though to achieve these numbers, @Tesla allegedly neglected the 'break and role test' this comes from the same source that alleges the securities fraud. So I won't dignify what would be a major breach in consumer safety (which would make Tesla insanely liable) (12/20)
And will most likely implement it to try and reach 10,000 a week. The rumors about securities fraud being committed on a massive level at @Tesla to inflate these numbers sounds as asinine as any conspiracy the flat-earthers would take credit for. (11/20)
@elonmusk I'd like to put on my Financial Analyst & Equity Research Analyst cap to talk about #Tesla with my experience from my old investment jobs. TSLA has been shorted unbelievably because investors never believed in the possibilities that @Tesla company can offer. (1/20)

funny how people doubt the numbers: 1. it's impossible to make up production numbers of CARS, it's not a mentos, it's a freaking car! 2. 40k people working with @elonmusk nobody leeks that info? 3. Yes @Tesla can produce at the same rate going forward, factorys don't get tired

People at shelter place keep asking me why do I have to wait to be hired @Tesla ? Well... cuz there's where I want to set my so called talent. I've never wanted to work. If it wasn't for my mom's psychiatrist I'll be happy at home, studying. I don't work. I study... and create.

I feel like most news sources are the bully who (once the scrawny 1st grader grew up to be well rounded, ethical and production capable) now makes a bunch of dumbass excuses as to why @Tesla isn't sustainable. Hey @FoxNews , 2008 called, they want their ignorant opinions back.

@Tesla @elonmusk your next car should be called the Cull. Then people can go around being like "What a sexy Tesla Cull you have!' (say it loud)
You should add @Tesla car birthday celebration reminder in iOS app every year.
OMG!!! Analyst hating on @tesla for not believing that production goal is sustainable!! before was reaching production goals, now they complain about keeping it. There's no pleasing these people! LOL
Si there any @dbrand skin for the @Tesla model 3? As it's actually more an electronic device than a car.
@Tesla is the future!

Why would you think that production will get worse over time? Why would iterative improvement not apply to @Tesla ? Hank Ford shared the same production issues, put up w/ the same BS from the same luddites. Revolutionary change to design/function/production/maintenance takes time
My dearest wife, We remain resolved, yet the front continues to falter, as we cannot find enough charging for all of our EVs. We hope to find another @Tesla supercharging station, yet maps indicate they remain out of estimated driving range. #lettersfromthesecondcivilwar

Wall Street is obsessed with #Tesla Model 3 production numbers. To some degree, this is understandable. But, according to one disruptive Wall Street Analyst, @Tesla 's production numbers don't accurately reflect the bigger picture for @elonmusk . http:// bit.ly/2NpRt7F pic.twitter.com/RrwsGtd8Pj

Serious question. A 13.5kWh Powerwall 2 VS Model S3Xy are around 100kWh-ish+? How difficult is it to do some #V2G already? Is @Tesla already trying, testing, UL certifying a cheap module to let the cars do what a powerwall can for the grid. Can @PowerLedger_io tackle the task?
Fast fwd into 2030 when wireless electricity and crypto goes mainstream - you'd have a swarm of @Tesla vehicles recharging those in deficit (calculated by how far they are from final destination) while at the same time automatically transacting.
Hahaha.. This what happens when you are too transparent about your production status... Cc @Tesla
. @Tesla dropped new braking test in final days to meet Model 3 production goal. http:// bit.ly/2z9WjCF #tesla $ TSLA #tech
That'd be awesome. Additionally, you could extend this feature to non- @Tesla cars, or just some particular car companies (i.e. that start with F) and charge a reasonable fee :)
Ah, also a good point. I don't think Camry sales are the target for @Tesla . Too large a delta in price points. It will be interesting to see what a sustained order rate will be once delivery times are reduced to weeks instead of months, though.
I asked the same question about a month ago... but not getting any love. Glad it's being discussed though. " @elonmusk @Tesla Any plan for being able to charge a Tesla from another, or feed power back to a house (say during outages, etc.)?"
Thank you @Tesla and @elonmusk for liberating us from petroleum dependence, boring cars, and an antiquated transportation industry. Cheers to you and your team on this #july4th #tesla #teslamodel3 pic.twitter.com/1DpCyJoZVW
If the @tesla #pickup has a 220v outlet, then you could probably do low-amperage Level 2 AC charging from it. Inefficiently of course, but possible.
Approx 50% of #EV & #HybridElectric sales in the #USA sales were attributable to @Tesla . No wonder so many special interest groups, including other automakers, want to see them fail. It is obvious that automakers will only change when they are forced too. #Weak . $ TSLA pic.twitter.com/TXlL60Rkch

@elonmusk @Tesla I think that for people like me (who are kinda forgetful), would really benefit from wireless charging. Would that be possible for a car? Because if so, I think that could change the car industry forever.
Funny how @Tesla shorters continuously gripe about supposed breaches to safety regulations and codes. Yet these are also the most vocal shills for deregulation and absolute free market. #DoubleStandards anyone?

@Tesla @elonmusk They finally responded that they changed the only part that could have caused the problem and were going to send it back to me in Windsor. They then washed the car and as they put it back on the flatbed truck the "Brakes FAILED".

Another reason to use electricity directly instead of carting around a fuel cell charger w/ you battery. FCEV vendors & H2 refiners should be primary funding source for H2 stations. Cost difference between charging port (like @Tesla Destination Charger) and H2 stall is enormous.

More than 1 million engineers graduate every year in India and 80% of those are unemployed. This is purely due to lack of practical exposure in universities and also less manufacturing industries. Thoughts @elonmusk @SpaceX @Tesla
Yes, but in NL is no Car-Industry which is protected by the government. In Germany, the rule "Profit before citizens' health" applies. @Tesla certainly got pressure from German government agencies like @BMWi_Bund .

in 2014 I got myself stuck deep in a "lie" that I may or may not have ordered a @Tesla #ModelS . It went on so long I eventually had to tell hubs truth so we could order one for real. The benefit? Our waiting landed us in the delay that ultimately became autopilot 1 hardware.

Why did BMW, Ford did not start making EV's till @Tesla came along. Simple- they only cared about their pockets not the common man's risk of dying from cancer due to pollution. Minimal spending on R&D to boost profit margins. Elon put his own money and life into it. Go buy TSLA

@elonmusk You should make it so that if I wave at a @Tesla is beeps back. Would be a nice touch.
Repeat: @Tesla why did you steal my $1,000 deposit and refuse to refund it? Does @elonmusk need a new moon rock or something?

@Tesla Please check your messages.
Do you have a joint work related to electric cars will be produced in turkey? @Tesla
Why did you steal my $1,000 @Tesla ? Why won't you have the common decency to refund this?
@Tesla Taxes for electric cars in Brazil had a massive cut with an incentive program of the government ("Rota 2030"), is there coming to Brazil anytime soon? PLEASE SAY YES.

Loan locked. @Tesla called to inform me that I'm looking at 3 weeks to take delivery! Thank's Javon, for the guidance and help. Gave me goosebumps when I was expecting at least three months. #SilverModel3 #NonTeslaOwner @elonmusk @DMC_Ryan @Model3Owners @NYKChannel Pinch me.
Hey @DMC_Ryan this is the closest spec ICE truck to compare to @elonmusk description of the @Tesla truck. I think your $100K+ price estimate is probably close (although I think a 60K F150 killer with 350 mile range would sell like hot cakes) pic.twitter.com/ZURtOvfOWq

@elonmusk send me a free @Tesla & I will give you free popcorn for life.
Electric cars were already super cool 40 years before @Tesla came to market and 50 years before the 1st Tesla roadster has been sent to space :) @elonmusk

@Tesla there's a fundamental issue behind the fact that if the car is overheated, the AC power goes to cooling the battery, as opposed to cooling the passengers in the vehicle. Not to prioritize one over the other, but for future models, both should somehow be accommodated.
@Tesla @elonmusk
@elonmusk @tesla Wow! Just got my Tesla Model 3 delivered today. And I have to say it drives better than other EV cars. Thanks so much to Elon and Tesla team. You guys did awesome job of building the best EV! I my Tesla Model 3! Btw, brakes work great too pic.twitter.com/BDgpHRSfTy
Hey @elonmusk when does @Tesla open an entity in Romania? we can't get the 10k state incentive as there is no legal entity :(
Since construction trucks keep going back to the same place every day, maybe there should be a solar powered @Tesla mobile station on a trailer that you bring to a job site and keep the trucks plugged into during the day. Uses site power if available but can go it alone if not.

Instead of a new coup, we got a tractor for our farm. It just makes more sense. I wanted one that was electric, but @Tesla isn't developing farm tractors quickly enough. It's dumb because electric tractors are easier to charge......
@Tesla @ElonMusk #TeslaX in the winter the aircon works well, in the summer it's broken. To let it repair the customer needs to wait for 6 weeks to get an appointment, after 1 week it is still not repaired. And the best: you get an exchange Jaguar car with #Diesel , Iol
Hey @businessinsider / @lopezlinette looks like @Tesla doesn't have a problem with saying 3 to 6 weeks, taking folks money, then going 12 weeks with hardly a peep about delivery. Maybe you care?
Same thing happened to me when I took my ICE car to @Tesla .
@TransPod_Inc CTO Ryan Janzen seems like a bullshit artist intent on persuading people of his contributions to science and engineering. Apparently, he invented the non-existent field of "absement". Has he ever come across @Tesla or @SpaceX 's radar? @elonmusk
I just got to drive a @Tesla ! It was an amazing experience! Anyone want to help me buy one!

BYD uses the inferior Lithium Phosphate chemistry in their car batteries which are not suitable for grid storage, or even long range cars for that matter. Furthermore, they are far behind @Tesla in battery manufacturing capacity.
Can we sensationalise this anymore with comments from @Tesla and @DaleVince ? Sounds all cloak and dagger... maybe a new Hollywood blockbuster starring @elonmusk
@elonmusk @Tesla any possibility for a tesla smartphone?

@elonmusk @Tesla suggest an audible alert on model 3 if driver's seat is vacated but phone being used as key is still plugged into the charging console. Left my phone a few times. Creates a security risk

@elonmusk Will @Tesla guarantee that 180,000 first day Model 3 orders will be within at most the first 250,000 deliveries? Profit important, but I think you can blend Standard Range in at break even to build loyalty.

Tiny kid sized sub would make a great ride for @tesla HQ once you're done rescuing people with it. Lil' piece of history on display but if its functional would be mega fun for people touring factory (and employees could ride it too!)
@SpaceX @Tesla innovation is always impressive and something to admire amid all of the negativity we see and hear. Hope the plan is successful. Good luck.
Yo S/O To @elonmusk @Tesla What You Doing Is Really Dope
@elonmusk any chance of @Tesla doing a (factory sponsored) official lap time of Nurburgring Nordschleife w/the #PerformanceModel3 ?
@Tesla the model 3 is the coolest car ever
One of the early signals of the end to the hyper-personal ownership based transportation industry. This along with @Tesla 's hopes and electric transportation. Transportation ability is empowerment (CEO's jet anywhere while some worry about driving too far to a friend's house).

Drove a P100D. Zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds. @Tesla
When you're done rescuing everybody from #Thailandcave I think the tiny kid size sub should be a ride at @Tesla HQ.
Once again considering a $ TSLA #model3 AWD. Biggest concern is will company be around in 5-7 years too provide updates and support to vehicle. I want them to succeed, but it's a tough business. @Tesla @elonmusk ?
Initially I thought @elonmusk 's @Tesla pickup concept sounded like Thunderbird 2 in parts. Now with all these ideas for the Thai cave rescue, is his next company going to be International Rescue?
