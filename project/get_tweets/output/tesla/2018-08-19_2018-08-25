@elonmusk @Tesla Elon: Even Mother Teresa has hatters! BTW, if one wrote a bad book, the only way to fix it is by writing a better one! Tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity.
@elonmusk is this true? Would you care to comment? What is going on @Tesla , Mr. Musk?
@elonmusk @Tesla what does a man gotta do to see Tesla in Peru! I need a model x!!!
I have a friend in California who became a mall walker at age 34! It's because you can charge your @Tesla for free and early morning has no wait time.

This is a parody account. CFO is making fun of @Tesla and their (cover-up) claims.
Did you hear that ? Was it another spacex rocket breaking the sound barrier? No it was @Tesla breaking the 6k per week!!
Shout out to @Tesla @Airbnb @Uber for changing the way we do things. No dealing with shitty sales ppl to buy a car, playing games on booking sites to get a decent price or getting passed up by a cab that doesnt wanna take you home at 3am
What If @Tesla Car Automatically Senses And Then Displays On The Back Side"You're Too Close"To Tailgaters So That They NOT Only Respond To The Brakes Being Applied But They Are Also Made Aware of The Distance The Tailgaters Are Encroaching Which They Are NOT Supposed To @elonmusk
@Tesla @elonmusk See If Driver Seat Is Enclosed & NOT Visible To Anyone Especially The People Sitting In The Back Seats Being Driven To Their Destinations Whether A Person Is Sitting In The Driver Seat or A Robot Is Sitting In The Driver Seat or None Is Sitting In the Driver Seat

@Tesla if that's the case please do something about Edmonton to saskatoon. Why should Calgary have many planned to be built when this exists.
. @Tesla Houston Galleria store very crowded today. People trying out S, X, and 3 vehicles in store and wall to wall test drives. Confirmed order (first day in-store reservation) for a red 3 with white interior and AWD, Targeting December delivery.
12/n, and @elonmusk , you want to really surprise the shorts and make them cover? Invite them to @Tesla , hear what they have to say, and LEARN from them. They're smart people who have some good points. I bet if you listened and used the info to improve, you'd be better off.
Is the board of @Tesla going to fire @elonmusk ? #comingnewsstory

@Tesla should abandon the attempt at broader consumer appeal, make luxury cars, and sell their batteries out to other auto manufacturers. Be a battery company, not a car company. This means they're still at the forefront of innovation, while also having a hope of profitability.
Misleading tweet. Those days will be over in 2025 for @Tesla , not in the next couple of days, weeks, months or years. The lack of electric models and batteries and sustained delivery from the producers you mentioned, will make Tesla lives easy as leader.
@WhiteHouse @PressSec @TheJusticeDept @StateDept IMO NYT Sulzberger & partners pushing & promoting Iraq War WMD Lies that cost US 3.500 lives,35.000 injured & $1.7 Trillion should be included in the http:// Investigation.Now trying to steal @intel & @Tesla w/ fake scandals & news

I just noticed that the @Tesla logo looks like an IUD.
As I said, @elonmusk , @Tesla , you are not alone. You are doing it right. #standbyMusk
@elonmusk @tesla When will there be a ludicrous 3? Assuming it'll be a new car and existing dual motor performance won't be able to upgrade? Only reason I'm waiting to trade in LR 3 for dual motor performance model.
Agreed. The packs are amazing but the onboard charger, BMS/thermal management are what really takes care of the battery, making them idiot proof. And free OTA updates just keep making those systems better. Imagine the FUD if @Tesla packs had even minor degradation issues!
@Tesla is there any way to get a better idea on the date of a car and the delivery. Looking at 3rd party finance for the M3P I ordered. Loans are only good for like 15 to 30days at the locked in rate.
For those bulls who want Elon to stop tweeting... Do you understand the whole planet is talking about him and @tesla ? Free marketing. Talk good or bad but talk about. (Marketing 101) $ tsla
Or FUDing in a fake act of concern, actually trying to make it seem like @elonmusk is loosing his mind and draging @Tesla and $ tsla with him. There is no need for expressing this in an open letter.

@elonmusk @Tesla Just loved @MKBHD tour of the Tesla Factory with Elon Musk. A very nice guy walking around the factory with the Brains behind Tesla.
So what if the Tesla Company's board has strong ties to Elon? He founded the company.. Also on their privatization, I say go for it! If they @Tesla can do it, why not, then they aren't just out to give shareholders dividends & they can truly work on any project they wish!
We don't mind travelling ;) Zero emissions rock! If you're anywhere in Virginia and would like to meet up let us know when and where and we will see if we can make it. Always great to meet another @Tesla and EV enthusiast. :)

@Tesla @elonmusk when are you going to ship Tesla apparel outside the US?
So @elonmusk , if a @Tesla is about to have an accident and #AIsoftware catapults the passengers out the back with the same speed that the car drove before the imminent impact, will the passengers just land on their feet unharmed (assuming no-one coming from behind) #SummerSlam
How many doubters have been disproved with their falsehoods about @elonmusk and @Tesla ?
Ive agreed with this idea whole heartedly before! @Tesla @apple collaboration as long as all current Tesla employees stay including Elon!! I see substantial opportunities for both parties and for the World!!
@Tesla 's stated gross margin figure is polluted in $ & %. SG&A is inflated by variable direct labor costs that otherwise should be allocated to COGS. (variable cuz it changes with prod volume) $ TSLA 's auditor/accountant will have to testify to misleading financial statements.

Hey @elonmusk heard about district 27J in Colorado is changing to a 4 day school week. They save $700,000 by not running buses on mondays. How about a @tesla #electricschoolbus ? There are about half a million school buses in the US that could be electric. #ludicrousspeed

Dad in history they talked about @tesla and how people bought all the stock to protect it from the shorts, because it was too important for the planet to move away from oil. Yes I bought stock, exciting times!
Quote of the day from @WSJ from @Tesla Chief Executive @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/OQTdJEAtqa
For some uplifting news, patients with limited mobility in Vermont will be getting @Tesla Powerwalls to protect against power outages shutting down medically-important hardware and a/c (which can prevent heat-related complications). How cool is that? -KS
l am dreaming of owning a @Tesla someday soon. Maybe I can barter minerals and gemstones or services for one. @elonmusk
Approaching the two month mark on my #TeslaModel3 and I have to say thank you to the @Tesla team and @elonmusk . You've made a car more advanced than the multimillion helicopter I fly!

My apologies for the repeats. It's the @tesla Kool-Aid.
$ tsla wompy wheel conspiracy theory (cc @WombatPickled ) What if it's negligence coupled with planned obsolescence? @tesla doesn't care that it's a problem bc it ends up making insurers and the #tesla loyals buy more cars?
So far @SEC_Enforcement has been very cooperative with @Tesla in allowing the company to hide these documents from the muppets, but now that we're talking about serious investors it's only fair to open all the closets I guess
@Tesla hey if u need control techs then lemme know, just curious what programmable logic controllers are being used in the factories? the ladder logic probably intense but structures text will ease that up hopefully

Also would be great if @elonmusk would tweak my @tesla navigation to list all charging stations according to distance from current location, not listing @tesla superchargers first and all others at the bottom, as drive/scroll = drink/drive
Would be great if @elonmusk would add a trip calculator to my @tesla app which would calculate distance and in route charging stations to my destination based on my current charge status.

@Tesla I found a bug in your website (not security, just a silly bug). Who can I send a screenshot to?
@Tesla gotta do better
Exactly. The goal is to find enough new/old investors to support the privatization in order to keep the same current balanced ownership. This could be crucial to assure long @Tesla shareholders to #GoPrivate . Nothing wrong or suspicious with that.
@elonmusk Sir..Where's the red @Tesla in space now?
As a model 3 owner, I love what you guys are doing. I'm rooting for you. Best of luck getting supercharger access! @Tesla
Why not make a version of Model S, X and/or 3 that ends the body behind the the B pillar like van and truck makers do for the aftermarket customization companies. It would bring more variety to @Tesla 's line faster by doing less! You could buy back the chassis converted to vans.
@elonmusk @Tesla @woodhaus2 hoping to see a mini pick up variant of the #ModelY in March to get my wife off my back about why there are no good small electric pickups.
Why is their no option for electric vehicle? For my wedding many years ago we got a Porsche 911comfortable. It was a great choice they would have never caught me if I got cold feet. Would love to be able to get a @Tesla Model X easy exit.

It's a no brainer, been at a wedding today and was waxing lyrical about electric cars, let's hope some of them took note. If I could afford a @Tesla I'd have one. No questions asked.
@tesla needs to knock the manhour per unit cost down quite a bit before the $35k version can be produced. Sometime early to mid 2019 is currently targeted, but even early 2020 would be an incredible achievement.
Love it. There should be a meeting with an automobile insurance provider to give better rates to @Tesla owners. It's one of the few costs that go up in #Tesla ownership compared to comparable gas vehicles. This may incentivize sales.
