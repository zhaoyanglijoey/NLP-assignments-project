Hey @elonmusk , on tonight's @TheSimpsons , Krusty's goes nuts with his @Tesla pic.twitter.com/TTYsBhPLV9
Good points, @neiltyson . As a @Tesla owner, I have to agree with you, both about my love for my car and my appreciation & respect for @elonmusk 's visionary leadership. https:// youtu.be/BXcgBfi4xxo
Rode in my friend's new @Tesla Model 3 last night and we tried autopilot on the freeway. Wish we filmed a reaction video for YouTube because that was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced. This is our childhood imagination coming to life. $ TSLA

My first real problem with my @Tesla #PerformanceModel3 is happening right now = my charge cable is stuck. I tried to disconnect it and the light turned red.

@WallStCynic Tesla's employees r motivated working for @elonmusk . Best engineers go to @Tesla & @SpaceX . Legacy automakers are very lucky Tesla is so bad at high volume car manufacturing, otherwise they would be in deeper trouble today. 2019-22 will be interesting. Cc: @mayemusk

If @Tesla is considering suggestions for #supercharging stations in #Missouri , I nominate @UranusMissouri . Uranus is more west than Rolla (making for a more equal mileage gap along Route 66 through MO) and makes for an entertaining stop as well!
Watching tech people make excuses for @SpaceX @elonmusk @Tesla is like watching a cat paint. It's amusing but useless. Nobody is framing their theses. But who will clean up Felon's Feces? Impaired lenders and all stock holders.
All the more reason to demand that Detroit produce Electric Vehicles that are on a par with @Tesla in terms of battery range and network availability.

Was looking forward to our @tesla model 3 home delivery today. But it was a no show and never got a phone call or email telling me anything.
Neither was big auto considering @Tesla a risk and look at them now, commanding the luxury sedan market. This is just another case of the "too big to fail" mentality that could put traditional airlines out of business in a matter of years due to ignoring the future of innovation.

I am surprised you prefer complexity of something like @Tesla to simplicity of 1960s 1970s aircooled Porsches and 1970s Mercedes with w123 chassis. I can fix most things on both including motor without lifting the car. Tesla is not fixable
@elonmusk I think I just missed out on a toy @Tesla under the referral scheme by one day,delay in sorting paperwork of 2nd Tesla. I wanted to give it to my local children's hospital as part of my advent challenge #NGRadvent , any help?
@elonmusk @Tesla what would be an awesome addition to the #teslaapp is the ability to activate some or all cameras remotely for in-app viewing at any time, esp while parked.

Tesla Founder @elonmusk is noted to be worth north of $20 billion, but his official annual salary from @Tesla is just $1. #randomfactoftheday
@SunriseScorpion Very true but there is a proven double digit efficiency gain using electric cars, even if the power comes from a coal power plant. @Tesla did a white paper on it several years ago. Not a home run but gets us on first base.
As far as demos go, Google did autonomous demos on multi-hundred mile routes last decade. A feat many, including pretenders like @elonmusk / @Tesla have not yet accomplished. Some of these players are a decade behind and will likely abondon their efforts in due course of time.

3rd party supercharging stations would be great value adds for retail shopping centers. The chargers will attract customers by making charging available to @Tesla owners who are NOT on a road trip. Maybe even make it part of valet service to reduce ongoing cost.
Can @Tesla though?
Whenever you find yourself becoming bored, just remember there is a Tesla car with a mannequin inside flying through space as you read this. Thanks to our god @elonmusk @Tesla
I just changed my response from "And ...?" to "So what." If you've got a CFA, then you know that debt is paid with FCF, not from any one of the lines in the income statement that @Tesla fans reference. Non-cash expenses do not pay down debt, so let's rely upon the CF statement.

Yes and that company is @Tesla . Bears have said that either @elonmusk would go bankrupt or everyone else would. Well, hear you go. Good for GM having the foresight to reconfigure before it's too late.
Thank you @Tesla ! My Model 3 tire got shredded to pieces during rush hour drive at the Florida Turnpike. I called you guys and was back in business with a loaner tire in less than one hour!
People complaining about GM closing plants don't seem to get it. It's the story of all companies. When they fail to innovate and there is better competition then they fail. Companies like @Tesla are growing and producing more cars that people want while GM doesn't innovate.
Also, we need to remember when America had to bail them out along with Ford and Chrysler. It's time to boycott American made cars... Go @Tesla
@elonmusk - Looks like there might be a car assembly plant available in #Oshawa come 2019. Time for @Tesla to set up shop in Durham Region???

Not sure @Tesla would agree on this.
Special shout-out to Victor Braescu for being an awesome delivery host for our Tesla. @Tesla
@Tesla @elonmusk GM is closing the Oshawa, Ontario plant. Oshawa has been making cars for 100 years. The town is sorta desperate for a solution. Buying the plant would basically guarantee good PR in Canada forever, and it would show up GM and others. Sound like fun?
I work 120 hours a week. I'd jump at a chance to work @SpaceX or @Tesla to implement my masters thesis on supercapacitor technology but alas my application go unnoticed since I'm SOUTH AFRICAN and not AMERICAN. Or maybe it's something else

Just test drove a @Tesla Model 3. Love the ride. @elonmusk and crew did a great job. Now deciding if I should pull the trigger and get it.
@elonmusk @Tesla tesla app needs ability to close all windows. Rain got in my model 3 today because of window slightly open and seat airbag now needs service.
It will make @Tesla 's entry into that market more difficult but there is plenty of room in that market imo. There are lots of people out there who have no problem dishing out $80k for a nice truck.
@elonmusk @tesla @MKBHD , how good will the #model3 latest hardware be by the time the second tax credit is over next summer? Worth it to wait or take a fat loan now for like half a new one?
@GM closing down #OshawaBuiltGM plants is admission they are losing the battle for the future of automobiles to @Tesla - Hopefully we finally never have to hear from #BobLutz again. @elonmusk

I wonder when @elonmusk with his @SpaceX will plant a @Tesla on Mars, Saturn or Pluto................words are said so easy...........but @NASA is MAKING dreams real. Good work @NASA !
So let me get this started. @realDonaldTrump is threatening to end "subsidies" for buying a GM electric car. Would this apply to all electric cars? @Tesla ? Prius? @NissanLeafPt ?
#Automotive @Ford @GM @Tesla I'd love to see brake light brightness proportionate to the force applied. When driving behind another car in moving traffic, it would be great to know the difference between them cautiously riding the brakes vs coming to a fast and hard stop...

i love the @Tesla car I got but good LORD do I hate how awful their customer service is. it's surprisingly bad.
People get confused when they try and value @Tesla like a car company. It's not just a car company -- It's an end-to-end, vertically integrated sustainable transport solution.
Whaaa, GM payed back their buyout in 2013 with interest, it was a good investment by our Gov, this was coming for a long time, the Oshawa plant is state of the art, im sure another company (cough @Tesla ) could use the space and our work force (cough @elonmusk )
Yes, @Tesla , @elonmusk , please manufacture in Canada. We would be very proud to build your cars and trucks.
No, no, no. @Tesla Field, next to the Tesla plant in Fremont. Plenty of land. TWO freeways. @BART station on site. Room for homes & shops. As close to San Jose as humanly possible without actually being IN San Jose. @ElonMusk @DaveKaval @Athletics pic.twitter.com/tcNPadTLy5
The @Tesla Model S is too small for my uses; however, the Model X is the smallest I would look at buying. I am looking for a BEV version of the Range Rover SV Autobiography LWB but that is rumoured to be 2024 to 2028 which is not good enough.

Happy birthday and thanks for your continued support in @Tesla
@Tesla issued $20mil of new shares for @elonmusk to buy per SEC filing. Were these the $20mil of shares he claimed to buy on open market or an additional $20mil of shares? Either way devaluation. #TSLA #TELSA #ElonMusk #shares #stock #stocktrading #devaluation #StockNews pic.twitter.com/vWWvSxlp3t

@Model3Owners @EVRevShow I've read that preheating @tesla Model 3 when plugged in uses "shore power," yet I'm seeing a drop in battery % when I do so. Does preheating after charging to your desired SoC is complete cause the car to use battery power instead of shore power?
@elonmusk @Tesla @Teslarati How close are we to the update summon?
@Tesla @elonmusk can we fight ON Gov't to make it right for AWD orders that went in before the cutoff date as well? AWD model 3 meets all the EV rebate criteria and should get the rebate.

@Tesla @elonmusk Could you please add a feature so that auto-park works flawlessly at supercharging stations? It's sad to watch all these people that never back into charging spots fail over and over again.
IMO @Tesla should start ad campaigns ASAP. Aim to decrease new ICE sales (& increase #TeslaWait ). Decreased ICE sales imperative given CC. The increased frustration of more people #TeslaWaiting is worth it. Forced switch = best chance for #BigAuto ? $ TSLA $ tslaq @elonmusk
This could only be achieved by going through significant struggles which Short sellers and short term thinkers perceived as weakness. But going through those hard time has allowed @Tesla to get to this point. Long $ TSLA

when the E cars became the thing @GM @VWGroup and other major car manufactures well have much better cars than @Tesla and the reason @MKBHD is doing this car thing on his channel is so that he get to test drive the Tesla Roadster when it came out

#Tesla Before I signed a solar contract I was told permits would be submitted same day & I'd get an install date upon approval. After signing contract permits took 1wk to be submitted (approved same day) and then I was asked to wait 5-6 weeks for an install date. @Tesla Help!!
I wonder how long it takes for @Tesla service to respond to a request for installing a wall charging. Email sent 2 days ago. @TeslaService
I would think @elonmusk would welcome more EVs coming in to the market. Aren't @Tesla 's patents mostly free to use anyways for this purpose?
@Tesla we have been trying to ordered the model 3 for the past 3 weeks. We initially ordered in Vegas, we live in VT problem is we can't get anyone responsible for sales here to help with buying it!!! What's going on with CS??

@elonmusk Brother in-law has delivery scheduled for Model 3, asked about return policy just to make sure, was told today that 3 days afforded to people who didn't test drive doesn't apply anymore, despite what @Tesla website says. Inconsistency causing him to question ordering.
Beautiful and classy but absolutely no reason for it to not be all electric. And good thing it soon will. Thanks to @Tesla
@elonmusk I understand that @tesla sold out of Model 3 roof racks in a matter of minutes. Can you please allow us to pre-order them so that when you do have them in stock, we'll get them asap instead of having to check the site every day... like animals. Thanks!
That statement is by someone never sat in a @Tesla in a launch ftom 0-60. I challenge you to get in a car on test with a Tesla and then come back on here and say same.

Reden te meer dat @Tesla de activiteit van de bestuurder zou moeten monitoren. Die 30 seconden is gewoon een slechte implementatie van "driver drowsiness detection". Snap niet waarom @elonmusk dat niet gewoon regelt.
@elonmusk a feature in @Tesla to lock the doors while sitting inside. Also automatically lock doors while driving at above 10mph so that passengers didn't open any door accidentally.
Why is there still no pre-orders... I dont care if i have to wait months for the actual production... I just want my name on a list.. If @Tesla can do it so can @Nadeshot ...
