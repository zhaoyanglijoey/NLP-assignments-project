@elonmusk , when is @Tesla developing a proper wagon, with a rear-facing 3rd row?
Why @Tesla and others don't put solar tiles on their electric cars? Is there a technical reason like not enough production to recharge effectively?
Nah I'd rather have a Tesla Model 3. #EVs @Tesla @Teslarati @elonmusk
I have a Prius and a model 3 @Tesla Way cheaper to run per mile in the summer 1 penny per mile in the winter 2 penny mostly because I like to drive in short-sleeved t-shirts no chance in hell you going to get this kind of mileage with AC or heat on or more than one passenger pic.twitter.com/K2ffECKCjE

@Tesla @elonmusk would power saving be significant if displays were swapped for OLEDs and introduced a dark mode?

@elonmusk @Tesla Just took delivery of a model 3 and love it! Thank you. Is there a way to add in the six months free supercharging post delivery using a friends referral code?
@Tesla @elonmusk day 1 reservation holder (pre event in store) did not receive gift when I took delivery of Model 3, is this still a thing?
Yes, I do agree there are some, maybe even many, but not all. I feel sometimes it's a shame people can't get along and be thoughtful of all motorists, it is still early days in the adoption of electric transportation, I don't even want to go into anti @Tesla sentiment.
I don't think so we should wait for @Tesla in India. Their is no sign it is coming to India. Waiting for #tesla from last couple of years but it seems nothing is going to happen. @elonmusk

@elonmusk @Tesla Electric School Buses could be the win-win scenario: no emissions and guaranteed schedules that would allow for their batteries to augment power demands at night from a solar/wind/etc-based grid. #WinWin #QuietSchoolBuses #NoEmissionSchoolBuses

@elonmusk @Tesla love this car model 3 which I had the luxury of owning my own but having 3 drive past me today in Macclesfield shows how popular there coming #oneday maybe
Just take an hour break for lunch where there is an L2 charger. Use plugshare to find a good one on the way. Make sure you can get at least 40a from it for best effect. It sure would be nice if @Tesla would enable the CHAdeMO adapter on the model 3 for situations like this.
I am but a license plate on a @Tesla
Really??? I mean I know it can take weeks for everyone to get the big across-the-fleet updates, but being such a minority I'd have thought all PUO cars had gotten it by now. I'd check in with @Tesla and see what's up.
@elonmusk @Tesla When the M3 comes to the UK - can you make the UV coating on the whole of the glass roof an optional extra please? Rains all the time here and it looks great. Best Regards
@Tesla @elonmusk How would you revolutionise train travel in the UK? We need better infrastructure and faster trains. Help!
@elonmusk just attended a @Tesla test drive event and was seriously disappointed to learn Enhanced Autopilot reqd in order to get Adaptive Cruise. The "most advanced driver assistance" of standard Auto Pilot are not all that advanced... needs to change.
I was wondering the same thing; much like his @nytimes @Tesla hate reporting, things just aren't seeming to line up with any sense whatsoever:)
@elonmusk Why don't we see @Tesla models as a team car and/or as a sponsored car in the Tour de France or other cycling races?
I think one of my favorite things about the @Tesla #model3 is bug report which takes snap shot of system logs for intermittent issues. What a visionary thinking Thank you @elonmusk It saves so much time not going to gas stations any more.
You are great source of new info on @tesla . Thank you :-)
@elonmusk get @RPMotorsports to race for @Tesla maybe that will bend the rules.

@elonmusk would it be possible for @Model3Owners that earn the wheels prize to pick @Tesla Model 3 wheels? I don't want to turn the prize into money, but I may have to sell them. I have the aeros, and it would be cool if we could get Model 3 wheels as an option (sport or aeros).

Yeah. I think the #2020 magical goalpost is dead. Unless @Tesla is taking about #ModelY and other products.
@dkhos Why is the @Tesla Model 3 listed as UberX? Can you fix this? It should be in the Select class like BMW 3 series and other lesser cars. I'm leaving money on the table not being able to ride Select. Thanks in advance.
@Tesla Canadian winter is something else ! People with the model 3 are having issues opening their doors. Time for heated handles @elonmusk
IMHO We need to have China stop stealing our intellectual property and they have to start winding down import tariff in our products. (Including @Tesla ) Trump does not have the finesse but somebody has to do the job. Not like other administration throwing the dust under the rug.
. @elonmusk Wouldn't it be great having a "stargaze mode" in your @Tesla cars, making the screens red-tinted to preserve light sensitivity for when driving out to scout your future Starship destinations? :) And for regular nights, plz also bring Night Shift mode (orange tinted).
This is really unfair for AWD order that went in way before the EV cancelation announcement. A total BS. @tesla @elonmusk please negotiate with ON Gov't for AWD orders that fell within the timeline too.

@elonmusk @Tesla party!! @Tesla party!!
A nice crisp fall afternoon. Out to give the @Tesla #Model3 a quick wash. #DrivingTheFuture #TeslaAR pic.twitter.com/tME5szKRzv
If by starships you mean "a new @Tesla " and by fly you mean "be given to me", then I agree
@elonmusk @Tesla on my wishlist for Xmas: Chademo support in #Model3 and the ability to heat up the seats via the app. Please?
@elonmusk let me be the first to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving. We all deeply appreciate and are thankful for the efforts that you and @Tesla team put into your mission everyday!
@elonmusk @Tesla Quick question - Do you think Tesla will reach its production goal (500,000) by 2020? If so, how? pic.twitter.com/Ml3lSzPcPP
Rather get an R32 in US and then a @Tesla Model S P100D with the rest of the cash
Please more in Europe! @elonmusk @Tesla @tesla
You do have a stake whether you realize that or not, we all do. That aside, how can you call someone that brought teams of engineers and experts together to reinvent not only the automobile @Tesla but also rocket design @SpaceX None of this would exist today without Elon
@Tesla @elonmusk Would a Doppler overlay on the map be possible?
Man! I wish @elonmusk and @Tesla would bring back the metalic silver paint. Ive seen many early model 3s with this colour. It looks bad ass with dark rims and other dark features. Savings for my model 3 under way!

@Apple could deliver a better experience to iUsers if they owned the pipe. Carriers are awful, even the un-one is barely better. @Tesla owners benefit from OTA updates the way mobile device users do. Apple should buy SpaceX for the forthcoming #Starlink network & Tesla team up.
My next car was going to be @Tesla . Now that plan is on hold. I will also exit my tesla position. No longer doing any business with companies with Saudi ties.
@Tesla while I really want this company to succeed and generally praise most things you do; I am appalled that you would ask employees to work durring Thanksgiving just to appease share holders. - Read this on an article from Business Insider.
@Tesla your new vehicle sans radiator cowling reminds me of minimalist facial structure featured in Gregg bears EON. https:// goo.gl/images/MFJxJw
Some companies with significant Saudi financing: @Uber , @Tesla , and @magicleap . Consumers should demand that they sever financial ties with a barbaric monarchy that murders journalists and commits war crimes. My column: https:// wapo.st/2DRKpyK
Yeah @tesla makes an awesome product. I will never buy another product.
I keep hearing reports that body work repairs will be taken in house @Tesla . Hope this is true. The outside shops doing it are a disaster.
Sadly, Northern Cali needs to be much better at this. I try to wave at all @Tesla drivers. Not much luck tbh. So I high beam them to get a response. Grassroots efforts - gonna make it happen. @teslaownersSV
Test driving a @Tesla
Sounds like Dedham @Tesla could use some serious help. I was set for 11/23, now suddenly pushed to 12/7 for no reason! Looking for answers.
@elonmusk please make all @tesla built in work to be able to track car environment even if not driving!
I think @Tesla are gradually building the pieces that will ultimately result in "The Machine That Makes The Machine"

Even with the rain the solar panels are still making energy. Thank you @Tesla
And I also commend @Tesla for taking the more difficult path towards attaining FSD
(Actual story: Found a crack in my glass roof, likely was there when I picked up the car as it's only a week old. @Tesla is going to fix it for me next month. )
Geofenced doesn't really count as FSD in my book. Maybe I'm heavily biased towards @Tesla , but I honestly think they're way ahead of everyone else. Just my two cents though
@elonmusk @Tesla Model 3 backseat airvents always blow hot air. Can we please control those vents for backseat passengers?
@Tesla @elonmusk how future proof is Model 3? The drive train and battery seems super long lasting. How about retrofitable tech parts like MCU? Is it super easy to upgrade Model 3 say 5yrs down the road?
@elonmusk @tesla Feature Request: this may have already been mentioned, but the ability to roll up windows if accidentally left down. Especially if parked and the windshield senses moisture.
@Tesla @elonmusk @mayemusk If you dare, there is a chance until first quarter 2019 to set gigafactory europe directly into the lions den, using the same universities, end coal mining in eastern germany earlier.

@Tesla uses a lot of cobalt in its vehicles. Not exactly environmentally friendly.
Yup @sara_boutall . Not unduly biased towards @Tesla I hope!
Sorry Fre, maar deze keer gaat het kloppen zonder h! Storage kan nl 2 doelen hebben, vermogen of capaciteit. Bij het #TerhillsBatteryPark van @tesla in Dilsen is enkel maar 18MW gekend owv inzet voor frequentieregulering. Dat is net ook wat Thermovault doet op #R1 .
Those results are hilariously unanimous @Tesla
One would think that the mobile McMansion is the perfect platform to be @Tesla -fied.

@Tesla @elonmusk Pretty sure I'm not the first to have this idea: scheduled preheating/defrosting or cooling before morning/ evening commute. Most modern home thermostats do it. Should be an easy feature add for Tesla OS.
It was refreshing seeing @Tesla leaving a Challenger to dust on I-95 in Jacksonville yesterday. Who knew!

Just got my winter tires on #model3 & @tesla @elonmusk hoping you have ALL resources focused on trying to fix the regen issue. This is a important safety issue that can lead to accidents. Not knowing if you will get standard, low or no regen each time you step on brake is serious
So in the situation of an accident then you are left with a vehicle that will not be repaired because who will do the repairs? So then what do @tesla car owners do in this situation? Do they use the insurance money to buy a new Tesla and wait for the delivery of the new car?
Black Friday sale @tesla ?

Blame the @ONgov @fordnation . This is not @Tesla fault. Had they did a fair wind down of the EV incentive everyone who ordered before the July 15th deadline would have their cars and 14k incentive. It was the risk of not ordering when the PC's won the election.

Have @Tesla got ticket evasion mode yet? Next stage for autopilot. Circle the block until I'm ready.

You have accelerated the EV market through competitive pressure, by years, if not decades. Since I have at least a dozen 200+ mile trips in a year, let's filter that list to EVs with 200+ mile range... oh, I see... redirect to the @Tesla website. #RangeAnxiety
. @Tesla reduces its prices in China due to promote vehicle sales after the trade war. El Financiero. http:// bit.ly/2KwkzRK
@elonmusk @tesla can we get the option of adjusting how far the mirrors tilt down when putting it in reverse? Or having only the curb / passenger side tilt and not the driver side?
Building up buyer interest in the electric car market where @Tesla dominates? Yeah, pretty smart
@elonmusk @tesla can we get saved passenger seat positions? And can the driver seat automatically go to a profile based on which phone unlocks the car? My wife's seat position crushes me into the steering wheel on auto-entry
People who buy @Tesla
@elonmusk @tesla hey can we get a way to nickname radio stations? Really annoying trying to find local AM stations that come through as FM digital channel 2/3 when they don't broadcast a name and the frequency is different from their AM call
@Tesla see you soon in Ukraine)))
While we are picking up our 5th @Tesla tomorrow, there has been a few times where if @Porsche could of gotten off their ass with the Taycan, I would of seriously considered making the move. 2013 LEAF, 2014 S85, 2015 LEAF*, MX90D, P3D+* and tomorrow is AWD3*. *current.
Time to go see Santa at the mall Daj me @Tesla pic.twitter.com/l1P3rUNHjK
Steph must be protected at all costs. He needs to be driving a @tesla lol @elonmusk
Took delivery today of the @tesla #model3 thank you @elonmusk and your team. Cant wait for my #solar to turned on now, then i will be powering these bad boys for free! #teslaforlife #NotSellingAShareBefore2500 pic.twitter.com/CfP1aOM2SM
I'd say that you and @Tesla bare some responsibility for folks having such a selection of full EV vehicles available in 2018! Is there any @Tesla left in the 4th generation Smart Car?
Every time I remember that the Model 3 isn't a hatchback, it makes me want to cry. Why @tesla , why???!!! Otherwise it's the most perfect car ever made, but that one mistake makes me not want to buy it.
Hey @elonmusk , when is the JARVIS voice Assistent coming to @Tesla cars?? I think it really needs it!
@elonmusk If I can afford to buy an electric car, its got to be a @Tesla
@Tesla and @elonmusk are best. And still don't have enough money to buy even Indian EV's
@elonmusk who do I talk to about getting some @Tesla charging stations at my hotel?
Thank you @elonmusk , once again you show the point . The importance of changing is above personal recognition. Love @Tesla
Can any of these be charged with @Tesla super chargers?
Well, if you're wealthy enough to afford a 4000 sf, you can buy a @Tesla . And if you live in a normal 1400 sf home, you have other options. No need to sacrifice.
Where are your #blackfriday deals @tesla @spacex @elonmusk
Oh I want one, I want to have an electric car but in the UK most options come nowhere near a @Tesla
@elonmusk @Tesla Tesla RV??
@Tesla $ TSLA pic.twitter.com/rsUIK6sXk6
It's probably more an issue of affording more than wanting. After the Model Y, the Semi and the truck, @Tesla should offer a sexy, $10K city car. Would be an instant, global success!
......Those cars will never be like @Tesla ! Cannot compare....
This what a business man who is confident in his product does. I'm going tomorrow to test drive a #Model3 and hopefully putting down my deposit too. @Tesla
@Tesla . There is nothing Else.
I want a Tesla will you trade me for my @jeep @elonmusk @Tesla
Who doesn't want a @Tesla ? Seriously...
Now thats honorable @elonmusk . We all know @tesla is phenomenal but educating us on your competitors is just noble.
But...I want a @Tesla Just cant get it in Jamaica
Just got mine model3 thx @tesla @elonmusk
For anyone looking to buy me something for Christmas, I wear a size Tesla Model X @elonmusk @Tesla #tesla #electricisbest
Yeah I still want a Tesla @Tesla
@elonmusk , @Tesla , Will we see the #Roadster v2 in the #LAAutoShow ?

Two months and 3100 miles in, the love is no less. Thank You @elonmusk , @woodhaus2 , and @Tesla for the impossible, unimaginable dream. #Model3 pic.twitter.com/fCHEWAb3vp

If someone starts messing with the Santini Tribe, Imma have Amazon drone deliver the tribespeople some blowguns. And crossbows. And a matching set of them @Tesla Flamethrowers.
@Tesla when is the Calabasas Supercharger finally getting installed? The equipments been sitting behind the commons for a year now. :(
A friend just bought a @Tesla Beautiful car, and super fast. pic.twitter.com/tqxYRIMyts
Is autopilot dangerous as stated by this youtuber? Watch the video below. @elonmusk , @Tesla @Teslarati https:// youtu.be/zLFju5Ld9d4
So great seeing all the @Tesla s on the road... not so great is all the superchargers are full and you wind up getting this almost everywhere. pic.twitter.com/6zGx8c2eHt
Was in Milan this afternoon @Teslarati @evannex_com @tesla Bellissima! Love at first sight! pic.twitter.com/CaWhEgv7rp
I think @tim_cook @aapl should buy @tesla & we could see 20-30mill EV manufactured per year by 2028 to speed up EV revolution.
@elonmusk @ElectrekCo @Tesla please consider changing awd torque bias for better slick hill performance pic.twitter.com/UCe772kw2m
Uh oh. He has arrived... #Grinch + @Tesla = ???? #tesla #modelx #autopilot pic.twitter.com/L9P9Y9zffI
I just did a test drive on the new @Tesla model 3, and wow that car is amazing, the freaking thing takes the left/right lane by itself, it takes freeway exists and switches between freeways without any trouble, and the parking, it freaking parks itself! I loved it
@meijer @sheetz thank you for partnering with @Tesla to install supercharger. I look forward to the stop when supercharging at your locations.
I had to do it, its time. My current car is from 2009 and well taken care of but its time for an upgrade! Finally fulfilled my reservation and now I just have to wait for delivery! @Tesla #Model3 pic.twitter.com/aZ5ziMdUB5
@Tesla could I use a Tesla 3 in this climate? Will be in a garage while at home, but outside while at work. pic.twitter.com/o0wLhgqxLX
My husband wins the #EV hunt competition on this #roadtrip . He spotted two @Tesla Model 3 carriers and a Chevy Volt, and of course Teslas too I can't compete with that! We've seen too many to count now though. Yeahhh for #ElectricCars !!
@tesla deployed a new update, and I received it only a day or two later, yesterday. There are a couple of key features. It came in handy because there is focus in cold weather features and I am at Philadelphia in really cold temps. Also a good security update was included.
Hey @elonmusk ,how about this:Pre-mars human occupation, how about @SpaceX setup @solarcity 's solar panels & powerwall integration by @Tesla for storage, so that when humans get there, they have abundant energy to work with? I see huge potential in this integrative application.
Why have I not seen someone attempting to convert a @Tesla into a gas engine car
@elonmusk There should be an automated way for @Tesla to know the waiting times, depth of queue, and freq of waits for Supercharging. Best way to know how to expand the network. No excuse for waits 50% of the time.
@BillyMonger really enjoyed your programme. Cannot our into words what you have achieved. Stunning an inspiration to everyone I really hope you raise the funds to keep the dream alive #BillyWhizz come on @Tesla @elonmusk help this lad out. His smile alone will sell your cars
@Tesla why calling service center "service center" ?! Sales center would be better because there's no service! Sales team can't give a laoner when service team is not in store! Incredible! So i drive in Canada with passenger window open because she didn't go up!
@elonmusk did you ever think that the vehicles you and the team @Tesla we're creating would be used in so many music videos and part of the cultural zeitgeist?
Hey @elonmusk when idiots cut me off sharply in autopilot we need auto honk. @Tesla
@Tesla Its been very tough trying to reach anyone at your customer support no, very long call wait times..trying to get update on my Model 3 delivery date, ordered more than month ago, need before end of Dec delivery and have travel plans end of year!
Go, @Tesla
@realDonaldTrump : oh i see, you are working with that guy i hate that guy @FBIMostWanted : sir? @FBI : we saw nothing @Tesla : over the air updates? @CIA : in conclusion @Comey : collusion?
@tesla no internet in the car for about last hour. Been driving, not in one spot. Midwest US. @Model3Owners anybody else having similar issues? pic.twitter.com/sgMJcjduf4
Going to have a countdown on my whiteboard and when my students as what it's for.... I'm just going to smile :]]]]]]]]] Speaking of... 13 Days 14 minutes and 20 seconds until delivery @Tesla
So many @Tesla 's everywhere! pic.twitter.com/cLiktTATtb
It would not be like that. I believe @elonmusk to be sincere when he wanted to help EV competitors. He is trying to grow the EV market which can be bigger than @Tesla 's EV business.
I am so lost. When I give my @Tesla to for warranty work, you guys put me in a gas guzzling SUV. Isn't that against your mission?
Getting busy... @Tesla #Model3 pic.twitter.com/v0t37EDnGn
Definition of a bummer: go to pick up your new @Tesla and they try to sell you a used one for a new price.
Hmm...a sensor on the sunroof that activates only if car is off and sunroof vented/open... will automatically close if it begins to rain.... feature default off but can be turned on for us who use the vent option a lot... @elonmusk @Tesla
I'd love to connect more on greening our fleet and buildings.. I'll be commuting to @Tesla and would like to help pioneer electric carpooling in Austin!
4/4 "Nine women a month not a baby made". More money can speed up building a GF but cannot clone @elonmusk nor the creative and productive souls at @Tesla . Hats off to all the @Tesla people, cheer leading twitting fans (new way of marketing?) included.
2/4 A possible answer: @Tesla 's bottleneck is NOT financial capital but human capital. The shortage of knowledge, insights, expertise and experiences goes at all levels at Tesla from top executives to software engineers to line workers to delivery truck driver to mechanics.
1/4 One thing puzzling even the Tesla bulls is why @elonmusk keeps saying @Tesla do not need to raise more money. Isn't it obvious that, with more capital, @Tesla will be able to build GFs for batteries and Model Y, and accelerate other initiatives? #tsla #tslaq
@Tesla , why can I not select the driver profile from the Tesla app. Am I missing something.
@Tesla everytime i call you guys have a wait time greater than 20 minutes. every fucking time. JUST HIRE MORE PEOPLE?!
Which @Tesla model do you drive?
11 weeks & 1 day since picking up my @tesla Model 3 LR RWD I hit 10,000 km! Was fortunate enough to have caught it flip over. I absolutely love this car! And I know it will get better, hopefully with some of my previous UI suggestions. Thx @elonmusk . @Model3Owners pic.twitter.com/MwsH2cZCRa
Gonna need a @Tesla like yours
Visited the @Tesla store in edinburgh today. They have a full chassis on display. Serious piece of engineering pic.twitter.com/aUeJuecbC7
@elonmusk @Tesla Any chance there will be some more SC locations in Texas soon? Driving from central and west is a bit rough currently. Long distances and high speeds makes for some massive detours to already long drives.
Qu'ils mangent de la brioche". Let them eat cake - or in modern terms: help them transition to electric cars #EV #zoe @Groupe_Renault @Tesla
I and my decent will not buy except @Tesla . I promise that. @elonmusk will encourage families and friends to do the same. We will be forever in your debt @elonmusk
Yo @Tesla @elonmusk what's the likelihood I can get a passenger preset on the Model 3
when we had our Smartcar other Smart owners would wave when we went by. Do @Tesla owners do that?
@Tesla @elonmusk why Dolby keeps coming back to my car? I hate it, immersive sound rocks. I want it back.
No I would like to get a @Tesla . But only for free.
Does @Tesla have plans to make pickup trucks?
@elonmusk @Tesla The cameras around our Tesla vehicles should be accessible to owners as security cameras and we should be able to view and record through mobile app.
@Tesla 's are the true Automobile. @elonmusk

What would you think about gifting some @Tesla cars to some unwealthy people, which maybe just got their driving license, living in regions where you rarely spot e-cars, to not just make driving for them safer but also promote enviroment-friendly driving? Hit me up @elonmusk

BYD Yuan EV360 is the bright yellow line in this chart, just started selling May 2018. Again, 190-mile range (300km) for $12-14k. How is that even possible? New model EV500 with 500km range (310-mile) coming soon. Cc: @Tesla pic.twitter.com/GdVHoxciyO
