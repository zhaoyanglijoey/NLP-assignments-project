I think @Tesla should be less concerned about #Tariffs & be more worried about having #EpicFail @elonmusk in charge of their company!!!!
@teslanomicsco , Ben, what are the legalities behind donating to a corporation? I would gladly donate $1,000 to @Tesla for the cause, and I'm sure most Tesla owners would do something similar. Not to mention other corporations that believe in the mission. Tired of #FUD .
Or a toy version of that @Tesla car carrier. My boy would go nuts for that.

Yes it is complex. But a car & to a greater extent any road vehicle & for maximum complexity all transportation are BEV capable. Many of the largest are already series hybrids like massive earth movers and trains. So, with cars, it really is just that simple, @Tesla proven.

@elonmusk @Tesla Can we get an update on Supercharger Network, please? As an example Oak Brook, IL had target opening Summer, but it's almost middle of the fall. As Tesla invasion began we need some more stations as soon as possible please !
@Tesla is on the forefront of the EV revolution making cars that people LITERALLY love. Why would any1 bet against them? To be clear, there are looming debt headwinds, but if your bet is based on a lack of demand, a rise in competition, or quality issues then you will lose.
Anyone can provide official TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of an #EV , not necessarily a @Tesla , from official sources like @AAAnews or @KelleyBlueBook ? Working to add it to our comparison tool within our app. Thanks! @cleantechnica @vevabc @pluginamerica @elonmusk

Well isn't it funny how some happenings are labeled "stock manipulation" and the majority are just... there, all the time. A simple explanation is however that they have belief in @Tesla and thus recommend buy while also buying.
Having @Tesla autopilot lane changes on surface streets with v9 just made my Monday!
There is no @Tesla without @elonmusk . There is no @SpaceX without @elonmusk .
@Tesla does anyone know what the problem is? The local Tesla guy sure doesn't. Wonder if other model 3 owners can go out and take a look on their car at that same spot as seen in this photo and compare.
Good on @tesla for highlighting @IPCC_CH report, hopefully @elonmusk will mention it too.

Frustrated as I am, what @elonmusk tweeted does not materially affect the SEC settlement or the improving fundamentals of @Tesla . Do I like the fact this happened? Absolutely NOT! Does it affect my investment thesis? Absolutely NOT! I am in it for the long haul.

Crazy to think that $ TSLAQ are trying to downplay @Tesla 's achievement in building a car this safe, discouraging potential buyers from buying the safest car available, and thereby contributing to a higher injury rate amongst the driving public!
The @Tesla transportation / logistics woes are real. We ordered a MX that was supposed to arrive 9/28, which was delayed to 10/12 is now not likely to show up till sometime early November. Likely going to need to have the winter tires ready to be installed on delivery day.

@Tesla our only real hope right now. No-one else is even close or remotely able to act with the speed, scale and technology.

@Tesla seems to be 10 years ahead of all other cars except for paint and panel alignment. They just need to get that figured out, then the only real competition they will have is when @Apple comes out with their car.

Yeah and @Tesla did not do anything to fix that afterwards? Like from then till now? Didn't @elonmusk enjoy using these internal emails to pump up the stock? That is what I only remember in recent times.
He was one of the first people to buy a @Tesla Roadster; not sure whether he ever pushed his around the Top Gear test track, though.
Wouldn't it be nice to see the business press go after @SpaceX and @Tesla 's competitors like @LockheedMartin the same way it goes after @elonmusk

Hey @elonmusk , just an FYI: We don't want @rupertmurdoch 's son to be the Chairman of @Tesla . Thank you.
@Tesla needs to pick a QUALIFIED director to be chairman...not someone who lacks relevant experience. Give me a break! $ tsla you guys seem intent on taking the share price back under $200!
James Murdoch is the lead candidate to replace @ElonMusk as @Tesla chairman https:// trib.al/0W5upWh #ausbiz

There is a parking lot in Toronto that tends to fill up with beautiful cars just before a big sales push. I drive by every day and always try to sneak a peek. I have seen that lot full a couple of times now, including today. Go @Tesla !!!
if this dirty kike lover becomes the new chairman of Tesla I will never ever even fart towards Tesla, let alone thinking about buying #tesla @Tesla James murdoch, stick to fox
That is why @Tesla rules

Best @Tesla Model 3 commercial ever? @elonmusk https:// youtu.be/0Z3ZjnwbA3s @slye
I've been waiting over a month for a call back. Have reached out multiple times. The lack of communication is not what i'd expect from such a company. I've had better service from lesser brands. So disappointed; I certainly hope this is not what all @Tesla owners experience.
@tesla @elonmusk Horrendous experience with customer service so far. Multiple calls & emails for my 2018 P3D which has several paint defects including dirt in the clear coat, folds in the paint, pock marks, bubbles, sandy appearance, misaligned body panels and rattles inside.
#SEC will be directly responsible if @Tesla moves to China. Will they prosecute themselves? How will they explain themselves to the emperor Trump? Get your popcorn ready!
@Tesla @elonmusk I am watching #TheWalkingDead and it occurred to me that the zombie apocalypse would be much less of a bummer with widespread adoption of #Tesla Roof and Power Wall.
@Tesla @elonmusk You cannot let James Murdoch become chairman of Tesla. It will be a disastrous decision. #EVs

Maybe now @elonmusk will shut up, with his behavior he don't make favor to anyone, just harm @Tesla and @SpaceX
@Tesla is on the same track thus far. Really hoping it's for protection from the media for the time being, as @elonmusk seems like a smart guy who usually has customer interests in mind.
@tesla delivered 8,180 (Q1), 18,440 (Q2) & 55,840(Q3) (w/ 8,048 in transit) #Model3 ALL @+$50K, yet no demand? So Q4 is going to ZERO? Tear-down Co's said $28K to build w/ 30% margin. Tesla reaffirmed ~18%-25%+ margins on ~$42K ASP, depending on production #'s.
Doesn't help @FastenalCompany when companies like @Tesla stiff them. Wish Fastenal would speak up about this. Lots of little guys getting royally screwed by Tesla's fraud.
What is one thing (I would likely understand) that you would change about @Tesla ?

If you really wanted @Tesla to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change then why not price them at 50k? Oh cause profits are more important than to make an impact on climate change to get at least 20/30% of society on EV. But investors...
As CEO of @Tesla , a publicly traded company, you have fiduciary duty to your shareholders (including yourself). That's why.
It also helps that I've been following @Tesla and @elonmusk . I absolutely love those. Fully believe in the mission. I want a $ TSLAQ #Model3 so bad. The people fan of Elon are such positive and incredible human beings. Such a great Twitter place. Been in a good mood because of it.
