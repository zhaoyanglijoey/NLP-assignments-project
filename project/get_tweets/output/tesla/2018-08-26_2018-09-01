@tesla @elonmusk any hint of an update for regarding #Model3 AWD deliveries? Sept-Nov still on track... since you guys are kicking ass with production?
Sounds strangely familiar... @Tesla , I mean $ TSLAQ .
Social media is disrupting the landscape for #corporategovernance in a way that may allow @ElonMusk to avoid serious penalties from his recent tweet about taking @Tesla private. @PennLaw Prof. Jill Fisch gives her perspective on this podcast https:// pennlaw.news/2KVPO79
I put my requests in early. You didn't add them. Not cool @Tesla . Not good of you at all. Very disappointed in you.
I wish @elonmusk will have @Tesla service technicians show up at owners property with Tesla rigid trucks fitted out as mobil workshops. This way guys like me could fulfill their dream to drive a rig, and fix awesome cars for a living.
Got delivery of my @Tesla 3 yesterday, been loving it since then. Car is just awesome, head turner. Thanks @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/OeiRBOaA9e
depending on your perspective, @Tesla PR could be the easiest job in the business since you don't have to actually do anything like write press kits or answer questions. Elon just does it all on twitter

Autonomous driving is not an add-on. Wintel will not work. That approach will kill people and will be shut down. To make autonomous car, you have to make a car. Big automakers don't have tech skills. That's why @Tesla will be the only one to deliver + possibly Chinese company.

@elonmusk @Tesla Your selling the idea of "solar powered super chargers" to public is just like selling snake oil in my opinion. You cannot harvest from sunlight more than what it contains. Even if you were harvesting 100 percent, you will need 70 solar panels to charge one car/h
You sure that is a @Tesla ? Looks like a @SpaceX rocket to me?
@elonmusk @Tesla I don't understand your plan to build solar powered recharging stations. How many cars do you plan to recharge in a day with solar energy and how much surface area of light you are going to need? To charge 10 cars every hour, you will need over 3500 solar panels!

BTW @tesla and when you do finally pay your hosting fees you may want to pay the $10 domain registration fees cause your http:// tesla.com domain expires in 2 months. Hey @teslacharts can you lend @elonmusk the $10 I think he maybe Short $ TSLA https:// who.is/whois/tesla.com

What now, @ElonMusk ? Five big challenges facing @Tesla https:// cnn.it/2MG6jdv
Standard range waiters like me showing 5-8 months still (previously was 6-9). Sad enough to lose half tax incentive, would feel promising at least if it continued to decrease monthly (i.e. switch to 4-7 soon) @elonmusk @tesla
I've been waiting for this since 2010, now I feel like I'm living in the future! Thanks @elonmusk @Tesla #Model3 pic.twitter.com/UHb19qyDPO
@elonmusk has his own timframe; usually what he says come true, but often in a bit longer time than first stated. I don't see that as a reason to think @Tesla is about to south and that $ tsla is a bad investment. But it is a rocky ride, much because of all the #fud .
@Tesla Never EVER BAD Mouth Tesla or Elon will call U a CHILD #@$@#@#Pedo HE WILL Use Millions of Investors Money N Company Resources 2Destroy U N Drive UR CHILDREN 2SUICIDE! Every Telsa Employee BELONGS IN PRISON! ALL of U! May every filthy Investor Lose EVERY PENNY Sick #@@#!
Agreed. However, Elon didn't bring it up. @yoda did. These troll accounts are simply trying to provoke a response to hurt @elonmusk and @Tesla .
@Tesla @elonmusk Love our new Model 3...but would love integration w/ @AppleMusic . Any chance that happens?
After going to half a dozen car dealerships, the @Tesla salespeople were the best, by far. They knew every detail about the car and the packages. 90% chance we are getting a p100d
We are building a world class Research & Development center that will overcome the challenges found in #SiliconValley .

Just a reminder that the @tesla Model 3 comes fully loaded with blockchain University on the touch screen. @elonmusk can we make this official with a digital Tesla crypto wallet that could operate in the Tesla ecosystem(superchargers etc.).

@TwitterSupport I just accidentally reported a @Tesla tweet as spam instead of the actual spam reply I was trying to report. My bad.
I hope @Tesla gives some to some professional drivers on an actual track, with some cones and such, and let the autopilot AI see what is physics-ly possible given a pro stunt driver behind the wheel. Could be invaluable training material, right? PS, check out my #S3XYFR thread.

@elonmusk @Tesla My name is Bruce Lim and I am currently a high school student with an idea that could benefit Tesla. I have tried sending it through mail to Tesla and also through e-mail to Press@tesla.com, but have not yet received a reply. I hope you received it. Thanks!
In the end, I do not personally think that any gov incentives, programs, rebates, not credits are critical to @Tesla at this stage of the game. Of course those help, and not just Tesla, but others playing catchup. The specific wording to exclude Tesla only is blatantly wrong.
It was nice to see news coverage about how high gas prices are getting and not have to care now that I have a @Tesla
A strong recommendation for the @Tesla Model 3. Doors need sound deadening material like Dynamat. This will provide the doors with a much more premium sound when they are closed. Only issues I see is adding weight and complexity to production :/

@elonmusk Your Model 3 has been a thing of magic but right now it's a decoration in my driveway as the @Tesla store support is unresponsive. No wall connector shipped. pls send help.
@elonmusk any chance that we get integrated services that people..... use? Apple Music, Spotify, Audible, Stitcher, Overcast, Pocket Casts, Overdrive, etc. @Tesla @TeslaSupport
The @Tesla #semi is arriving in TWO MINUTES
I think owners of MS and MX with a minimum of 2 years of @Tesla ownership should be on the local delivery team. What do you think?
@elonmusk @Solarcity @SpaceX @Tesla What do you have to say for yourself Mr. Musk? You have the entire World to answer to. You have been promising greener pastures to everyone. How many BTUS combined have your operations saved planet Earth to date? What's your cost per BTU saved?
Remote controlling my car to pre-charge for the trip to Seattle, and getting to just drive past the last gas station out of town without needing to topping off, Very fulfilling. @Tesla

@Tesla just got my second "delay to your Tesla model 3 delivery" call. AFTER I had already purchased my insurance for delivery in 2 days. Horrendous customer service. And this is a Tesla superfan saying this. I would get my money back if Tesla didn't deduct $3500.

@elonmusk @Tesla @Solarcity @SpaceX It seems an irresponsible thing to do to double the entire World's lithium consumption in one year, doesn't it? It's not just lithium, there is cobalt and graphite etc too. They have to be mined. It's not easy mining you know. Mines never last
@elonmusk any specific timeline for model3 standard battery option availability? Any chance of getting it this year? I stood in line for more than 6hours on day1, it's been 2.5 yrs wait so far for the promised $35k car! As usual @Tesla cust service had no idea abt the timeline.

@elonmusk @Tesla @SpaceX @Solarcity Lithium is invaluable as it's very important in our daily lives. I can't even imagine a life without lithium. We will be back to dark ages without lithium. It belongs to everyone. It belongs to all Hominidae alive and yet to come. All my family

Still waiting for our delivery of the Tesla Model 3 after the initial promise of the delivery on 2018-07-28. After two additional cancellations by @Tesla , we have not heard back from them on a new delivery. #lackofcommunication #worstcustomerservice #elonmusk
@elonmusk I loved my new @Tesla #model3 until my vehicle registration was held hostage by your team 5 weeks after delivery due to a missed FSD fee not being included in the signed Retail agreement. This is the WORST experience I have ever had.

What it seems it needs are cooling upgrades!! C'mon @elonmusk @Tesla ! Wanna silence the critics? Then build the car to NEVER PULL POWER. EVER.
@Tesla I was thinking it could be cool to have a Tesla motorcycle.
That does not include residences, which could/should do thr lions share of local storage for homes, easily done. Nor does anyone include the capacity assets in vehicles ever. 300 @Tesla vehicles at ~80kWh (low avg) is 24,000mWh already deployed in mostly stationary cars. Ponder?
@elonmusk @Tesla Mr. Musk, you are that Grinch who was about to steal Xmas forever. But I caught you. Your cover is blown. Cat is out of the bag and shit is about to hit the fan. Your only option is to flea. But there is no where to go for you. You will have to face the music now
Having to drive almost 70 miles every day really makes me want a @Tesla @elonmusk
@elonmusk @tesla "Detailer Mode" would be super helpful. Hide your personal info, lock glove, reduce max speed drastically -- but allow opening the frunk / trunk / charge port so that detailing can be completed. Loving my new M3 AWD and missing it already.
@Tesla how about installing super chargers at racing tracks?
Crap. Picking up M3 next week, forgot to ask @Tesla if some of these can be used with payment pic.twitter.com/gMVYkbxVSB
@elonmusk @Tesla I hope you understand why you are the real Grinch. For Xmas, because of you, there will be no more gifts of cell phones, IPads, notebooks, cameras, GPS, watches or RC cars etc. Kids will have to get used to wooden rocking horses as a Grinch stole good Xmas gifts!

Took delivery of our #model3 with a side of #misogyny at the @Tesla store. Apparently, I should be glad my HUSBAND had the money to buy one. And I don't deserve a driver profile. I can't believe @elonmusk wrote that part of the delivery-tech script. #DoBetter
With such massive sales growth, the @Tesla Model 3 has continued to strain resources. However, a new report suggests improvements are on the way. http:// bit.ly/2Pnek3K

Hey @elonmusk , Once your order is pulled from the list and your car starts down the line, the @Tesla app and site should show you car's progress all the way up to delivery... just like @dominos .... your car is <###>.... your car is in paint..... your car is in transit... pic.twitter.com/UKj388jewo

@elonmusk @Tesla Hope you are doing well! Any update on the FSD features for August release? I ended up pulling the trigger on my M3 day 1 reservation order and getting the FSD. Really hope some features are coming our way. Continue the awesome work Tesla
Hopefully they start working with @Tesla and use their charging stations.

@FredericLambert @Model3Owners Doug Ford is still being unfair and unlawful to @Tesla . Half-baked resolution is NOT fair for people. @Tesla . Update the outdated list of approved EVs and extend 50 more days for Tesla and reinstate cancelled #Tesla orders @fordnation @ONtransport

@fordnation @ONtransport Extend the transition period for @Tesla to have the same 60 day from August 31. It is NOT fair. Also, you need to update your list of approved cars as of July 13th. The list is already way too outdated. It is NOT fair to continue to do the damage to Tesla
So @Tesla just called... I'm all set for my #model3 pickup tomorrow!! They seem to think I'll be in and out in 15 minutes. I think they underestimate how much time I'm going to spend looking at my new car. #teslamodel3 #notsurethisisreal
@elonmusk @Tesla we bought a X 2/2017. 3 reservation 3/31/16. Fully paid for 3 Performance this week. This buying process is much worse than the X. Lack of information from IDA is beyond absurd. This must improve.

I had a dream I was screaming at someone that @Tesla model 3 was the same price as most new cars and relatively cheap and that they were being ridiculous on not getting one

After spending much of the day calling various people at @Tesla the best answer I've gotten so far is "you need to call your local DMV and figure it out." Not a great answer I paid registration fees to you guys already.
What if he got solar on his roof and battery in his house? Just saying. But I do understand your choice, and I think to make the EVs successful, car companies should make the car more appealing and competitive than ICE cars. Like @tesla .

I believe Elon said on the Q3 ER call that hardware version 3 would be released in 2019. An aside, I think @Tesla and @elonmusk should crowdsource ER questions from $ TSLA Twitter, @TeslaMotorsClub and @HyperChangeTV . Wall Street is so 2000-and-late.
Ya'll gonna flip your lid when you see @elonmusk @tesla release a motorcycle and electric-bicycle next month.

It is perhaps true that @CityofAlameda has a lot of EVs, but I am seeing a lot more @tesla #model3 cars on the roads here. Passed 2 in the last 5 mins.
Todays learning from my brilliant Model 3. If you want to mute the radio or pause playback on other media, press the left steering wheel toggle in (yup, the one that also does volume) @Model3Owners @Tesla I'm learning every day...
Had to have someone back my van out because it was blocked in and couldn't deploy the ramp without hitting the car that parked too close. Wish there was a #wheelchair #accessible @Tesla with summon feature to get me out of this bind independently.

@Tesla excited to pick up our new Tesla this week
@Tesla feature edit request: I know this is a MASSIVE nit, but some people (like me) might enjoy more "configurable" distances. EXAMPLE: I'm used to ballparking my (battery) range in Metric, but I need the MPH numbers for Current/Max speed. Is this too massive a nitpick?
In #Seattle saw ELON license plate on white @Tesla . That you @elonmusk ? If so pretty awesome to see
@Tesla ^ same question. You must already have the translations, so it's kinda eh to lock that :(
@Tesla and @elonmusk question - how would a subwoofer install work with a battery-only car? How would that affect the range and performance of the vehicle?
I will say that @Tesla is currently in the leading role for battery chemistry, longevity, and production. This is going to continue to grow at a ridiculous rate.
The FUD was getting so crazy that we figured the best thing to do was have some fun with it. @Tesla @mrkylefield @sidatkins @TeslaShuttle @TeslaMotorsClub @Model3Owners
Perhaps a @Tesla semi with it's driver assistance will make accidents like this less common. Maybe any semi with more driver assistance will help. Tuckers have a hard job

@tesla .com What is happening with the free supercharging on the performance Model 3. No one at Tesla seems to know.
People love @Tesla because @elonmusk is @Tesla . CEOs are what makes a company. #TRON is and will be a #gamechanger because @justinsuntron is a #gamechanger .

After that tone deaf article on @qz today about "hip-hop" and @tesla I'm seriously questioning their editorial rigour.
So what's after the #Roadster and #LongHaul @Tesla ?

Open..sou ...nvm @elonmusk @Tesla
Rich, I'm in the automotive industry. We all knew @Tesla wasn't going to be able to mass produce the $35k tesla. The reality is until the $135k electric can be produced for $40k, the Internal combustion engine is the greatest invention ever produced!
Hi @elonmusk I was talking to someone last night who works in a sector that is dominated by 2 car manufacturers & I believe you could help a LOT with @Tesla Interested?
@Tesla @TeslaSupport about how long does it take for a reply from the customer contact form on http:// Tesla.com ? Had a question before I bought a power wall but never got a reply.
@Tesla @elonmusk how about having your cars with a "Nice" horn and a regular one. Nice one for nicely moving People Out of the way ie. Honking with a smile #Smileyhorn

I don't have any inside knowledge about any of the EV makers, but would it make sense for @bollingermotors to just pay @Tesla a bit less than non-Performance Model 3 owners pay for Supercharging (to cover Bollinger's cost of collecting retail payments)?
#NamingTip : You want your name to endure. A name like @Tesla is iconic and enduring because it refers back to the famous physicist and engineer Nikola Tesla. Associating a brand with a powerful figure that embodies your values can be a great naming technique.
