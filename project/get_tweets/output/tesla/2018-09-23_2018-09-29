Why do @Tesla owners get to volunteer? Can a share holder get some love and an invite? I would be happy to lend a hand again after doing BEV car shows for a decade a decade ago. I am slightly ashamed to have sort of been slacking once we had alternatives to doing EV Conversions.
Good to see electric spreading into other transportation sectors. I knew a team of guys who started doing battery electric hydrofoil racing a few decades ago. Nice to see the rest of the world catching on finally. Of course economy of scale care of @Tesla helps drive much of it.
@Tesla or nothing
@elonmusk @Tesla enjoying my model 3p. Best car ever. I have a suggestion. Auto fold mirrors when opening garage door to make it easier to get in.
Officially part of the @Tesla family!!!One of the best days of my life! What and amazing car, thx @elonmusk , my delivery advisor annujaan and all the hard working staff at the Fremont! #model3AWD @TeslaMotorsClub @TeslaOwnersONT @TheTeslaLife pic.twitter.com/dV3hQ4Cc82
@tesla @elonmusk any chance to unlock performance model 3 track mode for Mont Tremblant race track on octorber 10th? Please!!!!
@elonmusk @Tesla Window control & auto roll-up on lock for the @Model3Tesla please.
Does @Tesla really *need* the volunteers to be successful delivering these products? A few possibilities:
@KellyannePolls @WhiteHouse @PressSec @ENERGY IMO @POTUS has a great opportunity w/ #solarenergy & #windenergy for #hydrogen USA can be the leader in #Fuelcells #batteries #fusion I would ask @Tesla @elonmusk to work w/ Adm. & get going , but it will be China again who steals it
@elonmusk @Tesla Rough weekend. Model X owner picking up Model 3 for my wife. 5 hr wait after agreeing to come early, then the next morning, no power, no screen, had to have it towed back to service center. Please make it right.
@Tesla @elonmusk Fantastic car! Any words on M3- Summon feature in Canada? Will it be V9 or dependent on key-fob?
Hey @Tesla you need to put Alexa in your control panel. So you can control with voice commands and keep your eyes on the road
How many charging stops will the @Tesla take to get that old Ford lady to DC?!? @markbspiegel #KavanaughConfirmation
Was told that the displays on my @Tesla model S just randomly chose to reboot while driving. Is this something we need to be concerned about? Rather disconcerting to happen while driving...
Idea for a @Tesla feature: Allow the windscreen wipers to be synced to the music currently playing allowing anyone to feel like Baby Driver. @elonmusk
I hope @Tesla is still producing the Model 3 in a few years when I get these student loans paid off. For sure wanna get one!
6/ It also shows that it is possible (albeit more of a stretch) to deliver 7K in last week in SoCal. It is at least not materially incorrect. We'll need to wait until @InsideEVs posts their Sept #s and @tesla posts their quarterly #s ... if you believe them. Thoughts? /END

Personally id love to work at a company like @Tesla . Tesla to me is a company that is putting innovative technology out there in interesting ways. Hopefully by showing a little more in my bio and having a nice header photo they'll hire me.
@elonmusk @Tesla @TeslaMotorsClub I do love hearing about the awesome things from Tesla and from Elon Musk. I hate that the media only tries to make things look bad or says negative / skewed things. Keep up the good work. :) <3

I just finished @elonmusk biography and I have to say that I am motivated. The struggles and prevalence to exceed all expectations to succeed. If you need a Technical Director of Audio/Visual with also being an ASE master tech in previous career, slide in my DMs @Tesla
First 24 hours w/ @Tesla Model 3 and I can say it is an engineering marvel & incredibly fun to drive but the experience of buying & picking up is horrendous. Missing parts, incorrect account info, disinterested "delivery specialists" - not what you expect for the $ @elonmusk
@elonmusk will there ever be a @Tesla for us poor ppl?
@tesla have a 3D delivery arriving tomorrow at the SC (out of state home delivery) and I can't get a corrected contract so I can't get my loan. That car is going to sit there because of paperwork. Help?
So awesome.... this is the exact configuration I'm going to order when @Tesla eventually starts shipping to South Africa... reservation and funding secured.

@elonmusk @tesla Question/FeatureRequest - To have multiple cards for supercharger payments and the ability to select which method to use. (ie personal or business) Can we currently do this? Or could you add it?
This is the video that made me go with the RWD confidently. It hardly snows here and I don't see any need for me to go with an AWD. Love @Tesla
@elonmusk @tesla Buying the wife our first tesla (Model X 100d) as a surprise wedding gift this year, but will be on honeymoon from Sept. 25-Oct 2nd. Any chance you'd extend the free supercharging another month as a wedding gift or toss a special code our way? :P jk. Can't wait!

@elonmusk @Tesla Considering the current car carrier shortage, would it be possible to offer car buyers an option to pickup their vehicle directly from the factory? I would have done it if Tesla would have waived a portion of its delivery fee.

@Tesla
6100 tweets + 52 followers = Someone compensated for generating content independent of the @Tesla IR/PR department. WHENEVER I CONFRONT THEM ON THE COMPENSATION ISSUE, THEY ALWAYS FALL SILENT BECAUSE THEY WERE INSTRUCTED SO BY THE PROCESS THAT ENGAGED THEM AS SHILLS FOR ELON.

Ever notice how $ TSLAQ offers constructive, patient and often empathetic advice to those who have been inconvenienced, because it's often in our nature as lawyers, enforcement, compliance or investors? @Tesla fans NEVER console them, they merely chase us down cuz they're paid to.
Are you suggesting customers don't create the config they want on http:// Tesla.com Yes @Tesla did, in fact, manufacture some inventory for obvious reasons and customers could skip the wait. The majority of cars they build are custom. 'No they don't' fails the truth test.
@Tesla All weekend and today, it's impossible to fill out Prepare for Delivery info on your web site. Grey spinning wheel after registration info is entered. Tried 3 browsers on two computers. pic.twitter.com/rDatotCyZH
I'm a $ TSLA long, so there is that. Given that @Tesla makes cars on-demand for the end customer, I would suggest their logistical model is not nearly the same as ICE mfgs. @Tesla must support spikes whereas factory to dealer lot buffers allow for logistical smoothing.
Elon did not ask he accepted the offer. And further I offer the exact same here in Germany if needed as I am grateful that @Tesla pushed so much and we're offered such great cars right now and not in like 50 years ahead!

As a firefighter, I'll probably never be able to afford a @Tesla but I fully support what @elonmusk is doing and I'm excited to see what's next!
Tesla really ended up coming through with the yyc delivery team and exceeded my expectations. The Tesla is everything I had hoped for. Amazing work team Tesla!! Love my new car! @Tesla @elonmusk
Exactly. The demand for the $35k base model Model 3 is huge worldwide (50 kWh battery pack w/ 220 miles of range). 2019-20 will be very interesting when @tesla is in a position to sell them (at $35k w/ volume). Keep an eye on reported gross margins in the next few quarters.
@elonmusk Can we get an audible blindspot noise when blinker is on but autosteer is not in my @Tesla ?
Wtf @Tesla ! I don't wanna know about winter until the snow bank at the end of my driveway is too big to drive over.

@Tesla @elonmusk I ordered my Model 3 on 6/29 with a Day 1 reservation. After, months of waiting, hours on the phone, and several issues with customer service I finally got a delivery schedule date. I got my finances and other details in order on my end.
@elonmusk @Tesla I've been working in car hauling company and I don't get the policy @Tesla is using. Trying to haul directly for @Tesla , in the end Brokers are hiring 3rd parties for miserable rates which nobody wants to move. That's why Tesla is struggling with deliveries..
Hey @Tesla , how about an #AppleWatch app and the ability to use the Apple Watch as a Bluetooth key, just like the phone? That would be super cool.
Most rewarding purchase I've ever made, and I'm happy to be an investor in @Tesla as of today. Excited to see you take this company to the moon, and humanity to Mars. Consider me in for the long haul. Thanks for your hard work Elon, I truly appreciate what you're doing.

Dear @elonmusk , How about auctioning Tesla 3 per week. The fund collected can be used to discount car for people who have been waiting for more than 3 yrs. Win-win situation. Enthusiasts get to skip the line. People with patience get the discounts. And @tesla gets publicity
Most of them hang around the tail pipe too much. They need time at the @Tesla store to clear their mind.

@Tesla @elonmusk Dear Tesla, I have been patiently and eagerly waiting for my Model 3 for years now... now at the finish line and the customer service I am receiving upon delivery ( now delayed ) is terrible. Way to ruin my Tesla experience.

Does anyone remember a video/picture/tweet of a guy driving his @tesla #model3 and had 3 carseats in the back? Would like to know which ones he got to fit. @TheTeslaLife @Model3Owners @Teslarati @HeartTesla @3Tesla1 @elonmusk I just ordered my model3 today and need a plan

And it seems @Tesla is only warming up. What insanity can we expect next, the next level of Plaid not mentioned in the movie.
@elonmusk why not to partner with a German car maker to produce more cars and accelerate the transition to EV? @Tesla
My goal is to buy a @Tesla for 2019. @elonmusk thanks for change the market. #tesla #futurecars #hooverteslaforwhen #PuertoRico #goals
Can not wait for the new V9 update. Thank you @tesla & @elonmusk for your incredible hard work on providing the best product to your customers.
Is the 17K M3 sold per month accurate? Is it sustainable? Or is that @tesla working through backlog of orders?
Hey @Tesla ~ hey @elonmusk I went and sat by the Tesla Charging Station at Target in Sunnyvale California. I fried my gourd. I synchronized with it for 15 minutes or so with a pretty sweet hum and concrete hand drum rhythm.

Sat in a Tesla Model 3 today. Wow! I want one @Tesla
@Tesla @elonmusk Are you guys taking @bollingermotors up on the offer of supercharger sharing? Would love to see other companies access the world's best fast charging system! #Tesla #Electric #Supercharger

It would seriously be awesome if @Tesla was an innovative and idealistic company with methods and practices to match the language. But they're not, they never were, and they never will be. Their strength was stealing money from people eager to feel like a part of something "big".

Time to truly take @Tesla private, innovate without distracting BS! Go @elonmusk , cannot wait to see more great news of @SpaceX & @boringcompany
Goy my @Tesla #Model3 two days ago and loving it. Delivery by a Tesla employee to my house was great! Autopilot is so helpful. @elonmusk can you shift lane position ~10% away from lane with cars if no cars on other side? Would be safer to add some buffer space.
"Am considering" meaning he is thinking about it. Also he didnt tweet it from @Tesla he used his PERSONAL account. So ita not fraud. This lawsuit will hurt shareholders more than Elons tweets will.
@Tesla
I'm sad for @Tesla the company and it customers. I was stung by the 420 Tweet as well.
I really think there are some actors who want to see @Tesla crash and are pushing for @elonmusk to go by all means. If Musk leaves Tesla likely will collapse and that will make some people very happy. #ElonMusk

I got a call from a Tesla salesperson today. I told him I had wanted to buy a Tesla 3, but then @elonmusk renewed his pedo crap again. I told him I am a huge fan of both @Tesla and @SpaceX . and this guy wanted to hang up the phone. I insisted he escalate it before he left. Sad.

Definitely not selling. Got a few hundred shares and will keep for as long as I feel Tesla could use some support. Still love my Model S as well. Behind @Tesla and @elonmusk all the way. Screw @SEC_Enforcement , shorts and FUD spreaders. May they have a miserable life.
SEC on a Witch Hunt, backed by big oil and the auto industry. I'm a gasoline burning gear head, don't own a Tesla, but this is BULL to the SHIT! Makes me want to sell it all and roll in a @Tesla because @elonmusk is a genius, and it's obvious to everyone.
Fantastic time to buy some @Tesla stock.
In other news today - the SEC has sued @elonmusk and has asked for his removal from @Tesla . Woof. This could be devastating to that company.

@elonmusk @Tesla was supposed to get M3 delivered today. Took the day off from work and waited all day. Was just told after making multiple calls that no delivery for me today. It's a car delivery and not an Amazon packet that I don't care about being delayed.
I'm real close to Fremont right now @Tesla Hit me up.
@Forbes superpower seems to make up false headlines to get some clicks. As someone who volunteered for @Tesla , I believe I speak for other volunteers as well when I say that there was no "persuasion" from anyone. @DMC_Ryan had an idea to help, other owners agreed! That's all.
The @Tesla delivery experience is pretty crappy. Been waiting more than two hours and they just keep telling me "soon". My car should have been ready hours ago.
Just imagine this scenario @elonmusk and @Tesla wait until the last minute for the sec ruling and take the company private. Thus proving they were capable all along, then turn around and counter sue the SEC.

@elonmusk @Tesla Hi Elon, I just picked up my AWD Model 3, the taillights were not working. There are four (two in the body and two on the trunk). This is a serious safety issue at night and needs immediate attention in my opinion. Perhaps more rigorous quality testing on this?

You think NOW is the time another company acquires @Tesla . You are more dilusional than I though. Anyone who lets you invest their $ is insane.
You don't become profitable by selling at high rate making only a few 1000$ benefits. You need to sell the most expensive version first. If you are not able to wait, you take your money back or you choose the expensive version, nobody force you to give up your money to @Tesla .
Hi @elonmusk , you can call @MrGoddijn from @Tomtom , he problably knows the whereabouts of Starman is now, or did forget to deploy the #HDmaps of @TomTom on board of the car? @Tesla

Ive covered @SEC_Enforcement for decades & here's something to keep in mind: The agency can't root out every fraud. it brings certain cases as reminders to the mkt of its priorities. Even in an era of deregulation full & proper disclosure is paramount as $ TSLA @Tesla case shows
You're trying. I just saw 4 car carriers each loaded with 6 @Tesla Model 3's on the 5 South freeway/ Highway 14 split. Nice.

That tweet really hurt. @elonmusk to step down as chairman of @Tesla https:// cnb.cx/2NRBiDW
Yesterday I saw he numbers thing... a person is n a @Tesla smoking a cigarette! WTH!
This drop in @Tesla stock is ridiculous
Kudos to @TeslaOwnersONT . So many of your members spending their Saturday answering questions and keeping us company while waiting for deliveries today. @elonmusk @Tesla
Holy fuck. @elonmusk has been fined $20m and been forced to resign as chairman of @Tesla on fraud charges due to the "$420" tweet.
Depends the value he puts on money. He is not risk averse for sure.... @Tesla is too big to fail, his cars are also world leading. Investors need to shut the fuck up.... #buyback
With everything @elonmusk contiues to do/try to help, is this all just a witch hunt? Honestly curious to hear opinions more educated then my own. @Tesla @SpaceX @boringcompany @solarcity #Tesla #Spacex #BoringCompany #SolarCity #ElonMusk #StarMan #BeTheChange #TheGreaterFool pic.twitter.com/eX9ybu5G4E
#supporttesla donate to support @Tesla .. All @Tesla lovers should support with ideas to help Tesla Keep the future..
Let's obviously understand this SEC fine against @Tesla and @elonmusk is nothing but the SEC seeing an opening and taking a shot at those. This settled for so low cuz it's just easier to pay to make it disappear than to fight bullshit allegations against you. #kidsPlayingAdults
Thank you @Tesla
Why is everyone Trying to stop @elonmusk and @Tesla . I don't understand some people at all .. Tesla is a great Car why all the Attacks and unwanted Or unwarranted law suits. We are with him and we will put in more money to make sure he succeeded. How can I donate to @Tesla ?
@Tesla @elonmusk $ TSLA Short sellers will have 2 very LONG & SLEEPLESS nights before they can close their positions and lick their wounds.. They wouldn't know how much money they have lost till Monday morning.. Somehow I feel sorry for their greedy souls..
Jeez! All this because he tweeted something? Noted, don't own a public company and Tweet. @elonmusk @Tesla pic.twitter.com/Ej3LvSkQez
@Tesla CEO @ElonMusk settles with the SEC for a total of $40 million in penalties. Elon will pay $20M and #Tesla will be liable for another $20M. Elon to remain CEO however step down as chairman. #TSLA pic.twitter.com/hqYxbm8EvJ
Agree. But all cars will be @Tesla

Had so much fun delivering @Tesla cars to their new owners at the Charlotte gallery today! I felt like the cartoon stork delivering new babies to parents, everyone was so excited! Here is a new Tesla Model X family having fun with their new electric ride pic.twitter.com/NRscypo7rf
3/ This next week @tesla is the Roman Empire under Constantine -- its last peak until a major restructuring. After this it is all downhill, first with the real unfiltered 3Q numbs and then the growing 4q rumors of falling demand and quality blowback.
Does a @Tesla certified electrician have to install or can you do self install?
@Tesla won't survive without @elonmusk and SEC decision would do more damage to #TESLA shareholders than #ElonMusk tweet. In todays world we need more entrpeunour and innovators like @elonmusk .
Any chance you can provide a non-reflective centre console option for the @Tesla Model 3, @elonmusk ? Matte black/white? Current piano black catches sunbeams and is a fingerprint magnet.
Stay strong and well. Too many of @Tesla people love you.
#GoPrivate @Tesla
@elonmusk Why is the @Tesla model 3 so damn expensive? Didn't you say it will be available for a low price??
Elon Musk renuncia a su empresa @Tesla pic.twitter.com/OwLWdGchiJ
@elonmusk The short's were tricked in to thinking they won! They shorted @Tesla even further... Now it's time to be electrocuted and roasted alive like a gass guzzling engine in the Nevada Desert. Let the electric revolution begin!!!!!!!
@elonmusk @Tesla how about something like 100kWh supercharger credit for every hour waiting at delivery center today? 5hrs and counting for us...
Is feels like @Tesla joined the Trump family of businesses.
@WhiteHouse @NASA @Tesla 2 HATERS & JEALOUS AS HELL ppl's CHAGRIN, Nation PROUD of @elonmusk 's GENIUS & candid desire 2 help this world be a "Better Place", echoing our BELOVED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 's God given STABLE GENIUS wrds at @UN . God speed Tziyon! Lucho, LtnJzz Voc&Comp
@toluogunlesi @Tesla thought he earlier rejected the deal...
$ TSLA Good for $ tsla @Tesla to separate CEO and chairman. Lmao @20mil, that's chump change haha. See ya @300 let's see what algo wanna do Monday. Feel like wall street haters expecting Musk goes to jail but they r gonna get nuked. @MadMoneyOnCNBC you hating now . Haha
#TopStory . @elonmusk agreed to step down as chairman of @Tesla and pay a $20 million fine in a deal to settle charges brought this week by the SEC. #tesla
Chairman to be determined, but it is holding/buying season @Tesla
Bye bye @tesla #tesla
Do you think that @Apple should at least own 5% of @Tesla ensuring Apple can overt which direction Tesla heads in?
My View: @elonmusk being CEO is a welcome. @tesla may be healthy if it heeds to CEO's recommendations. Does any of today's settlement change investors from watching @elonmusk , I don think so. His tweets will be valued even more, as @tesla 's execution matters more now.
Perfect timing. For over a month the stock has been held down due to uncertainties around the infamous 420 tweet. Amazing positive news around deliveries and V9. I expect more than a standard "pop". Time to focus on execution and continued innovation! Go @Tesla !
@ChrisCuomo crazy how when @elonmusk tweets irresponsibly he gets hit with 20mil$ fine to settle, and hast to step down as CEO of @Tesla also out 20mil$. @realDonaldTrump rocks market with tweets and no one @SEC bats an eye.
@Tesla and @elonmusk paying fine of $40 million over a couple of tweets. That's around 4 billion Kenya shillings. pic.twitter.com/VnUGvqNntQ
looking forward to being part @elonmusk board of directors @Tesla
@Tesla you fucking suck smh soft as hell
@elonmusk @Tesla Stunned by the system. Politics are bullshit. Hang in there.
Just picked up my performance model 3! This is better than Christmas! After a full day helping with other customer deliveries, it sure felt rewarding to get my own! Thank you @elonmusk @Tesla @mayemusk #teslamodel3 #tesla !!!
Yo i promose im getting one! @Tesla
Isn't $20m a drop in the ocean for @Tesla ? $20m=400 Model 3s at $49k...at 20% margin we're talking 2000 model 3s in terms of profit. Almost insignificant as they produce 5000+/week and ramping towards 10,000/week..no biggie. @elonmusk @ValueAnalyst1 @tsrandall @ellec_uk @gwestr
My brother-in-law had his P3 delivered to his home by truck yesterday! Went well, and he loves the car as much as we love our @Tesla RWD Model 3!
I am sure the guy has a great mind. I took a ride in a @Tesla recently. Magnificent experience. What I disagree with are the taxpayer subsidies for those who buy the vehicles. But as far as Elon goes, smart guy.
I have VIN 27***, both pieces of glass change color. Worth mentioning to @Tesla .
So. 1 tweet costs @Tesla and @elonmusk $40m. Is that the most expensive tweet ever?
@elonmusk now your stepping down @Tesla you can find time to join @Newton_NCP ? #FundingTheFutureOfScience
Hot take: Elon stepping down as chairman but remaining CEO is a best case scenario for everyone. This is in the best interest of shareholders, and @tesla itself.
. @Tesla y la #SEC llegaron a un acuerdo y @elonmusk deja la presidencia http:// ambito.com/935125 pic.twitter.com/BgvdSE6CbI
I wonder when @Tesla will put out a statement about SEC settlement...
One of the best car upgrades ever made. Couldn't be happier with the delivery. Huge shout out to the entire @Tesla team and many thanks to @elonmusk . pic.twitter.com/Gh9yq28zB1
So, anything new today @Tesla ? #toosoon pic.twitter.com/WyttVNk4iD
. @Tesla 's @ElonMusk steps down as company chairman in settlement over federal fraud charge: http:// crdrv.co/1FopB9w pic.twitter.com/bm9d8mg5iA
So the same @SEC_News that allowed Bernie Madoff to run wild and allowed the financial meltdown of 2008 which financially ruined billions of people is coming down hard on @elonmusk for telling the world Saudi Arabia offered to take @Tesla private which it had, in fact, offered.
Sometimes people do not understand genius, creativity. Simply because maybe if they did, they would be like him. This is only a small stone in the shoe. In three years we will see each other again @elonmusk thanks for being there always. @Tesla #Serendipity pic.twitter.com/57qKSJNczx
However Elon is staying as CEO of @Tesla ! https:// cnnmon.ie/2NSOCaS via @CNNMoney
