People forget that Elon committed to @joerogan in celebration of a @Tesla production milestone
A couple of years ago I could understand why people thought @Tesla could go bankrupt but given the start of this tweet was that the model 3 is number 1 in sales by revenue and the profit margin of the model 3 is reportedly higher than the average car They are only going one way
@Tesla shares drop because @elonmusk takes a hit of a blunt?!? Did anyone hear what he had to say? @joerogan thanks for bringing him into the long form for us to hear. Incredible human. It's sad to hear him elude to unhappiness in his mind. pic.twitter.com/1Ft5SapJHP

@Tesla @elonmusk I order a car 3 months ago yet others can get a car right away? Still waiting for new VIN. 2 delivery attempts, I reject the car and now you are trying to sell me the rejected car? Not cool guys! Not thrilled with this process.
I really want to purchase the @Tesla Model 3.
MyPOV: chatting with various @Tesla stores and it looks like the Q3 numbers will be blow out. @elonmusk may have some great news.
@elonmusk Went to test drive Model S - my next car. All the instrument panels look identical to my Benz - should be a smooth transition. I wish the run flat tires would be a standard option, though. @Tesla
@Tesla Where can I rent a Model3 that is! Keeping it real... haha! I fear *me* behind an S! !!!
@Tesla Hey, where can I rent a Tesla in San Diego? #NationalDriveElectricWeekEventSanDiego Actually owning one is still a goal.
Prediction: WHEN (not if) base Model 3 arrives, it will be priced @$35k, but by then @Tesla will have squeezed in so much cost efficiency (parts and labour) that it will debut with better features than the current spec. Perhaps it will be a 240-250 mi battery, better interior...

Thanks to all the @whitecar_rental . It's been an amazing experience to hire the @Tesla for the week.
@elonmusk The rest of the world needs to have your amazing @Tesla @TeslaSupport Vehicles. A modest Tesla for low income communities can chnage the world. Eradicate alot of air pollution and also make Tesla a Monopoly. Come on Elon, we need you.
@elonmusk Any hopes for a modest barebone @Tesla @TeslaSupport vehicle for low income communities? We can positively affect climate change & air pollution one step at a time. Large market we are missing with only serving high income communities
@Tesla factory tour was fabulous, WAY more action in there compared to two years ago, everybody going at it 110%. And we actually saw the GA3 line. Yes. WE SAW MODEL 3's BEING BUILT!!! SO. MANY. MODEL 3s. You could reach out and touch them. What a fantastic surprise

@Tesla I'm road-tripping from Seattle to Denver later this week and would love to try Autopilot on the trip. Is there any way to trigger the trial prompt? #TeslaModel3
I doubt this was in response to the Joe Rogan interview. I think its more so the tweets, email leaks from buzzfeed, and executive departures. The main point is @Tesla needs to be able to retain high caliber talent in order to grow. IMHO, not a terrible suggestion.
@elonmusk @Tesla why doesnt yalls service centers have recycling bins? Hated having to throw plastic in the trash.
The craziest theory I read over a billion tweets on the subject, is Elon did this "act" on purpose to bring down @Tesla stock enough so that he could personally buy said stock back in his posession at rock bottom prices #LMMFAO If only a poor guy like me could buy a Tesla
Didn't take long for @Tesla to bounce back

As a Model 3 owner I stopped going to gas stations (obviously). Today mobile service *came to me* (thanks, Corey - 5 service!). Definitely won't miss taking cars in to dealership for service (that's so 1990). THANK YOU @Tesla team for making the future a reality today!
Now this from @Tesla after promised (& failed) deliveries on 8/22 & 9/9: "Estimated delivery by late September We will reach out to you to schedule your delivery date. Delivery time frame will be based on reservation date, order date, delivery location and vehicle config."
People are just mad that @Tesla drug tests their employees, and @elonmusk is "smoking" on camera. I don't give a shit, but I could understand why people claim poor optics.
If people were as hard on @GM , @Ford , @Chrysler , & others as the are on @Tesla , everyone would believe the automotive industry was in shambles. Bonds, stocks, yields. Who cares? Tesla took cars into the 21st century and set a new standard that only it can meet. Thanks @elonmusk

It's a really odd choice for @Tesla to not put turn signals on any of their cars and have the A.I. cut off traffic all the time.

How rich can you get till you get poor? In contrast to government, climate change does not discriminate the rich from the poor. We all get poor with climate change; while the oil industry short sells @Tesla . This is poetry, when nature short sells the oil industry. good riddance.

Did you think @NYGovCuomo was a leader on environmental issues? NY has not been a standard bearer for these issues for decades. NY almost froze out @Tesla we were also late to adopt EV tax credits. CA is way ahead on electric transit and school buses.
Hey @crosstalksol I just finished a delivery with a customer and remembered you got the good news for an early delivery at the Portland @Tesla . Have you picked up your beauty yet?
@Tesla @elonmusk so my home solar system has been non-operational since May due to faulty equipment. When I call @tesla customer service line. The hold time to speak to a representative is ONE hour. Yay I feel like such a valued customer. Thank you.
That sounds like a @Tesla experience story on the website to me. They need to make it happen somehow.
I love hearing detailed feedback and experiences like this as well. I like the ICE to flip phone,Tesla to smart phone analogy. An ICE gets you from A to B at a cost to the planet and wallet,but a @tesla gives you that for less, and you have the internet, games & autopilot & more!

It could also be that electric manufacturers build all-electric cars that are just generally better than their ICE peers in every way. @Tesla is paving that path but we're still in the tech's infancy. The others will def need to do some catch up in the next 5 years.
@elonmusk @Tesla I think the UI/UX for models S/X should undergo a serious overhaul, at least with respect to aesthetics. Model 3 center screen software aesthetics and usability are great, while the software on the model S/X feels dated and clunky, by comparison.
Man I gotta tell u the hype I was hearing around @Tesla service is the real deal. The SC in Orlando is amazing. David and the team was nothing short of exemplary in taking care of me. @elonmusk u have something special going here. If only I could afford the p100d.

As far as I can tell, @tesla looks to be a technology company trying to cut its teeth on producing cars. So far, doesn't look too good. My brother took delivery of his Tesla X a few months ago. There are several build issues. He's living with the issues for now.
We picked up my mother's Model 3 on Tuesday. First 77 yrs of her life - no interest in cars. 3 yrs ago that changed when I got my S.

5/ Look for @Tesla to lower the price of the base model Model 3 as soon as they can, probably sometime in 2020, to continue the price pressure on legacy automakers. All legacy automakers are in big trouble, as jobs are lost there will be layoffs, riots & gvmnt interventions.
4/ It's really important to understand @Tesla : Tesla's goal is not to make $. From day one @elonmusk knew the car business sucks. The #1 goal of Tesla is to drive down battery costs, to force legacy automakers to sell pure EVs as cheap as possible, ASAP, to fight global warming.
@Tesla still better
You forgot about the seats, steering wheel, tires, wheels, windshield, etc. I'm sure there will be enough idiots left over to buy @Tesla lemon cars without these "options", lol!
See its acts like this that make me proud to own a @Tesla vehicle. They are a business that will do the right thing, even if it cuts into its own profits. Something that few business would ever do.

Visiting @Tesla and saw X dancing, wonderful, ...now if the head-rests would nod to the music as well...
WOW yet another #kodakmoment Vehicle for @Daimler why do they give @Tesla the market? We Drive Solar is the future. @elonmusk is easy to follow but Impossible to beat without serious #eMobility action by #Daimler #EQ seems like GREENWASHING. pic.twitter.com/LnHeDfOFBQ
You can use my @Tesla referral link for free Supercharging on Model S, Model X or Model 3 Performance. You can also get a 5-year extended warranty on solar panels. http:// ts.la/shereen36770
Tomorrow is the last day to order a @Tesla and get unlimited lifetime supercharging with a referral (For a S,X or P3). If you need one feel free to use this link! https:// ts.la/dan55923
Btw if this does happen, no shame in publicizing it. On th contrary it would be in line with @TMobile goals for sourcing clean energy and ride the @Tesla hype train
@Tesla + @SubstratumNet mobile nodes bro, earn crypto, save the world, decentralize the internet, Solar powered @Raspberry_Pi , tesla tablet displays, spend your cryptocurrency on the go with $ SUB #CryptoPay make trades with #AmplifyExchange in front of starbucks, Just do it NIKE
@tesla where you at, @elonmusk I think you can do better.
Or compressed air eg. the upcoming @Tesla Roadster.. it's as if we're admitting it's a major benefit when going horizontal, but FUCK IT for vertical it's gotta be pure hellfire ! But whew a big relief to hear Roadster wasn't getting chemical rockets

@elonmusk @Tesla @TheBoringComp Hi Elon. Everybody wud like a SpaceX version of this, got to sell as a kind of break from the stress of cars manufacturing. Maybe make it affordable, just 33% markup:-) make the fins sharper so there's no doubt it is a rocket- no confusion:D pic.twitter.com/NCH0PQnEU2

No joke, what you really want for that drive is a @Tesla with autopilot and a good audiobook.
I seriously want the @Tesla Model 3 but I fear a) I'll never afford a mortgage b) a 5" 0-60 car would blow my insurance away c) It feels like a lifetime waiting for the right hand drive to even be a thing??
The first $200k I make is going towards a @Tesla Roadster
@elonmusk @Tesla bought LR Dual Motor Model 3 and LOVE it but just discovered summon feature is not approved in Canada. Key fob coming or will it be approved soon? Feel mislead by website :( pic.twitter.com/lgOXBjzgVw
I wish the @tesla site was easier for finding used Model S all over the USA. I'm willing to fly somewhere and drive it back. Easy excuse for a road trip with the car :)

I was jealous of the special black @Tesla wall connectors with @elonmusk 's signature, & I'm too cheap to buy one since I have the old silver wall connector. So I added Elon's signature myself! #Tesla #WallConnector #Signature #TeslaModelX pic.twitter.com/UPUGKt2Xg9
@Tesla - would do it today
#Model3 @Tesla @elonmusk https:// goo.gl/images/LuyGw7
He was caught and arrested using Tesla tech. Tesla also updated all of their cars via OTA update requiring a PIN + fob (if desired). Best. Car. Ever. @Tesla
Would like one but too expensive :(. @Tesla @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/nUoT88aG1u
I have a friend with a model 3 @Tesla . I really enjoyed the @FullyChargedShw video they just put out hosted by @Carpervert I only have a Volt but I think model 3 may be in our future. https:// youtu.be/4AJw9cIlatw
2/3 "I do wish that many of our most prominent media personalities and institutions would examine the claims and records of many of these people. And in some cases there is a lot of evidence through court cases of just how malignant they can be." #TSLA @Tesla
Another one of your #dreams ...that will never happen. These @Tesla like shuttles are far more dangerous than your #incompetence
If they could extract you, then perhaps @Tesla would have made profit. #noob #investor

Forgot what battery S tesla uses @Tesla @elonmusk then use that in a battery pack capable of delivering that, connect it to the powersuply of the car and let it charge, i do the same on small scale on my longboards 10s (36v) so 42v max so get a 42v battery to charge the other one
Wow! This is so cool @Tesla #modelX . Extremly cool how those headlamps and all lights and the doors sync with the music https:// youtu.be/-jyPkg0yXzM
I prefer @Tesla , thanks
Elon musk enables rich old white people SEND TWEET @Tesla
I stand fully behind the goals and principles of Tesla; I cannot wait until I can't find the spare cash to buy one. That said, reliability seems to be very poor (based on significant research in the UK)- how are @Tesla looking to improve this?
You have to take action. The person staffed with managing the @Tesla account cannot do anything. It's an underpaid, young person who has "Vine and Tumblr" on his CV. You have to take legal action, not just tweet angrily about it. They are jerking you around.

@Tesla #CustomerExperience fail.Went with my parents to pick up their new Tesla no one told them ahead of time to install the Tesla app. They should check the age & tech savvy of their buyer and be prepared accordingly

Did you know that Puerto Rico , the hurricane-devastated American island with its ~4 million people, has ZERO Superchargers? And yet, they are buying all available @Tesla models. Today @tecnocato is shipping his P3D from Florida. Go team @elonmusk !

PSA: If you are purchasing a @tesla tomorrow is the last day I can hook you up with free unlimited Supercharging http:// mjr.mn/tesla
I hope they freak out. I want to buy @Tesla after 10% drop and short again.
@Tesla @elonmusk you should check out that https:// youtu.be/9vmmR3P58gs
@Tesla Tesla should hold itself to high standards. @elonmusk Big fan of yours, but disappointed with this experience. Elon, hope you can fix it. Thanks!
@Tesla No apology for cancellation. It's ~2.5 yrs since booking. Is this how Tesla behaves? Associate didn't have patience to listen to customer,was grumpy and ready 2 hangup. Poor standards of customer service. I am curious to learn how east coast weather affected this delivery
@Tesla @RadPowerBikes @FredericLambert @elonmusk My plan worked...2 inside, 1 on top! Electric sustainability all the way :-) pic.twitter.com/48pgzTYU0d
@Tesla Quite upsetting experience before delivery of my M3 this weekend. Received a call from Tesla that tomorrow's delivery is cancelled and will be scheduled at a later date as car is not here in WA. They are saying delays are due to east-coast weather. Doesn't seem right.
