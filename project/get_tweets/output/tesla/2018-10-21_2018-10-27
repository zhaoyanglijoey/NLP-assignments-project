@elonmusk @Tesla 2. Angle of back dash always has me trying to get higher to look behind car in rear view mirror...all seems so pointed/angled too skyward. Maybe lower back sill an inch? Gives up clearance space for trunk loading I figure but worth it. LOVE THE CAR!
@elonmusk @Tesla Love my Model 3. A couple of suggestions. 1. Need a dead pedal for right foot when in autopilot. Folding leg up or holding off of power pedal main source of fatigue on long trips. Maybe space to add a small leverage place behind center console in footwell? 1/
@elonmusk @Tesla , I am doing my best to generate awareness in the Milwaukee community to build an ecosystem for electric cars (Tesla biased... LoL). Hope we see more EV charging stations outside shops, malls, and hotels. Please ask the DestinationCharging team to respond quickly
@elonmusk . There is an incredible resource at https:// supercharge.info that shows all @tesla super chargers everywhere, including upcoming ones. Because of google pricing it is offline now. Could you donate money to keep it in working?
@elonmusk do u know when #model3 will be available to #lease #Tesla #model3 #models @Tesla thanks!
@NokianTyresNA are you going to work a deal with @Tesla to supply tires when the US plant gets up to speed?
Test Drove Tesla @Tesla . Pretty cool but the road noise was kind of a damper on model 3 and partially on Model X as well. Falcon door is the best part.
. @Tesla announces lower cost Model 3 - and it's coming to Australia @elonmusk #Tesla #Model3 http://www. techguide.com.au/?p=100772 pic.twitter.com/ZxyQrPTwZ1

@Tesla can you give a warning before you charge people on your site? Then say it can take up to 6 weeks for the refund on something you technically never bought?
For instance in Sunderland UK the Leaf batteries are made on a grid about 40% nuclear (zero carbon), 14% renewable and 36% gas. But other factories like @Tesla GogaFactory are working towards 100% renewable factories to make their batteries. @106Euan
Yes, I do think and I do believe that @Tesla makes and sells shitty solar panels. They are not even close to anything @SunPower makes. Of course, they are not as shitty as most of Chinese solar panels.

It's not that ridiculous. I've lost count & have been reminded by some who drove my car that they'd done so. No recollection in some cases! Probably 30+ trusted drivers. @Tesla could likely determine number by local supercharger visits for demo charge! I rarely use it otherwise.
Mark my words I will one day own a Blue and black model s @Tesla

Great question and answer session on @Tesla 3Q report. Safety [of cars and factory injury prevention] is by far the biggest aspect of what they try to achieve. Several goals mentioned were: 1. finding more efficiencies; 2. build on same continent sold; 3. help other manufacturers pic.twitter.com/gIz7Eyjojq

What a quarter! Congrats to @elonmusk and all the @Tesla team members.
elon and @Tesla honestly crushed that call... not selling a share before 5000 <3
YESYESYES!!! Congratulations @Tesla and @elonmusk
So it appears as though the SEC decided 6% of @Tesla profits were sufficient punishment. That's okay, he'll make it up 10 fold in Q3 2019. Next few quarters will probably have a lot of reinvestment to further products and production. Guessing stock will fluctuate btwn $330-420ish
@Tesla continuing to prove skeptics and critics wrong
@Tesla Thank you ALL for your immensely difficult (but hopefully rewarding) work in fulfilling your mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. YOU offer hope that Earth's life, our home, will be brought back from the brink. Congratulations to $300M+/Q3 Net Profit!
@elonmusk Anti-Theft idea: Require password to turn off location services / App access. @Tesla should require account password or PIN to turn off app access.
@Tesla post profits in the third quarter
@Tesla , Thank you. It's been an amazing experience owning and driving #Model3 . You exceeded my expectations 10x by providing hassle free valet service for #Model3 and returned it in less than 6 hrs.
@elonmusk #confcall Any convertibles on the way ? Cc @Tesla
What @tesla #tsla bears don't understand is the pure joy that comes with driving a Tesla, it turns its customers into raving fans that promote the brand everywhere. I'm a former S owner, like to save $$, don't need a car right now, but my Model 3 will be coming in a few weeks!!
@Gfilche @TeslaPodcast @TheTeslaShow @ValueAnalyst1 sounds like @Tesla could benefit by using #TeslaSemi and platooning. It could speed up the delivery process and reduce costs while improving future products.
Tesla shares jump as Musk delivers quarterly profit, cash https:// reut.rs/2Segnt0 Let's see if anyone buys them after the government stops subsidizing your entire profit margin. @tesla
@elonmusk To reduce time from factory to end customer, would @Tesla save money if they flew buyers (who were interested in such an option) directly to the Factory to pick up their new car? I would gladly have picked up in Fremont and driven to LA.
Some metrics from $ TSLA @tesla 's 8-K - Revenues up sharply QoQ and YoY - Inventories down QoQ and up YoY - Customer deposits down QoQ and up YoY - Accounts payable up QoQ and YoY pic.twitter.com/ztIAP5Fd14
@Tesla Do service centers stock chademo adapters or is the only way to purchase one to order on the web?
Nothing boring about making money and saving the planet. Thank you @elonmusk and @Tesla #TSLA
@Tesla if you guys need someone to advertise your car by giving me one. I'm your guy!!!!
Super proud and excited for @Tesla and @elonmusk to turn a profit in Q3! Congratulations!
Tesla Q3 ER CC: "I actually almost forgot one important thing...the average time to get a car from factory to customer was 30 days. End of the quarter we reduced it to 20 days. Our goal is to get it to under 10 days. this is a giant improvement..." - Elon Musk @elonmusk @Tesla
Just plain crazy! @elonmusk on the @Tesla earnings call right now: '"Every 10 days we require $750,000,000 dollars. The banks will only loan us 80% of the cost of the vehicle, which translates to about 70% of the price of the vehicle." Thoughts?
Why did @elonmusk step down as the @Tesla Chairman and is it already affecting the company and it's customers? And you thoughts about #Teslaquila !? @MKBHD #AskMKBHD #techtober
@elonmusk envisions #Tesla customers forming a fleet which is a combination of Uber/Lyft+Airbnb of autonomous vehicles. People can share their cars with self-driving capabilities to pick-up and drop-off commuters and @Tesla is best positioned to do it. The future is here indeed.
So excited to see where @Tesla is at in 5-10 years
Hey @Tesla shorters. Got some news for you. #Tesla pic.twitter.com/bkQMgozAoV
@elonmusk @Tesla is there anyone monitoring support at http:// shop.tesla.com ? Im having trouble getting a reply. My Starman Mug came broken.
@elonmusk @Tesla Horrible questions on call. How about this: 'you just did $5,000 in ebit per unit...and 30% sequential cost efficiency and still see low hanging fruit...how much more profitable than ICE is electric??'
. @elonmusk on @Tesla 3Q earnings call: ``We do not intend to raise equity or debt, at least that is not our intention right now.''
@elonmusk Agreed!!! Yes!! Safety IS the reason I want ALL of my family in a @Tesla !!
A @Tesla is like buying a ticket to the future that pays off over a long period of time, making your life easier every time you drive (some safe fun now and then too). Great earnings call, great quarter, and great company. And I'm just an owner not currently a $ TSLA investor.
Someone asks about the new chairman search for @Tesla following #SEC settlement and @elonmusk says he won't answer the question, "going to restrict questions to operational topics." $ TSLA
This ends what has been a turbulent time for @Tesla , with U.S. security regulators accusing #ElonMusk of securities fraud after he posted misleading Tweets, a move that forced the company and for Musk himself to pay a hefty penalty http:// bit.ly/2O4HeEz
. @elonmusk brushes off a question about how new @Tesla chairman will be selected, saying telecon is limited to operational questions.
. @elonmusk talks up long-term plan for @Tesla ridesharing fleet: "We'll compete with @Uber and @lyft , obviously." #Tesla owners will be able to add cars to the fleet or remove them at will, he says.
When someone finally asked for what attributes @elonmusk is looking for in a new @Tesla Chairman, Elon said, "I'm gonna restict questions to operational topics." #earnings pic.twitter.com/aLGyUubCEy

@elonmusk @Tesla @SpaceX I would wager SpaceX's future product portfolio would give Tesla a run for its money for 'the most exciting'.
#Tsla ER feeing Happy for @Tesla investors not because of the stock gains but a gaint first step towards the reduction of vehicle pollution.
Hi @Tesla : For anyone experiencing the issue where #TeslaCam stops recording to USB & you're reformatting the USB to get it working again. DO A FULL FORMAT on USB -not- a QUICK Format (Windows defaults to quick) =that 100% solved the issue for me & it's been recording ever since

@Tesla endures the cold winter and shows positive movement after q3 earnings
@Tesla dose it better
. @elonmusk says global demand for @Tesla Model 3 is between 500,000 to 1 million units per year. Adds that the car regularly out competes the BMW 3 series, which sells about 1/2 million a year globally.
. @elonmusk says @Tesla should deliver cars to Europe in Q1 of 2019, to Asia-Pacific region "certainly in Q2."
From @Tesla Q3 report: "We expect to start taking orders in Europe and China for Model 3 before the end of this year." WOW!
First question about the mid-range #Model3 . @elonmusk answers that @Tesla isn't yet ready for the standard range car, due in large part to wanting to get deliveries started in Europe. #TeslaQ32018EarningsCall
This earnings call was just awesome. Thanks for an amazing quarter @Tesla @elonmusk :)
In the Q+A session on the @Tesla earnings call, waiting for someone to ask @elonmusk about the hunt for a new Chairman. pic.twitter.com/Sfl5S89zea
Next question about #Model3 margins exceeding expectations for this quarter. The improvements to enable this were in reduced labor hours and increased volume per Deepak. In other words, @Tesla was way more efficient in production in the quarter. #TeslaQ32018EarningsCall
@tesla @CNBC Ist question is on cell supply and tight labor. Boring. Not strategic. Record breaking EV production mean Tesla is able manage logistic. No need to go into details. Polite answer. Focus on G3 AI, Autopiloy. @p_ferragu is coming on. Should be more relevant. Got to go.
@Tesla So between now and 2022 Tesla has $8.5 billion in debt coming due. Can anyone explain how they are going to cover that with these earnings.
Awesome 3rd quarter @Tesla @elonmusk is living up to his promises! Great believer in what Elon is doing for our country and the world! #muskeffect #Tesla #MakingAmericaGreatTogether
Wow, this @Tesla Q3 call is actually making me emotional. Tearing up a little. On-site doctors and nurses, sustained profitability, autonomous driving network? Let there be no question, the future of safety and innovation has arrived.

Congrats to @Tesla on the amazing 3Q. Model 3 is everything I've ever wanted in a car: safety, convenience, fun and capability for 0 environmental impact. Now if the video game suite could only be upgraded to include pole position and dig dug I'd be really happy
Sometimes the they make good points though. Saw a video recently where the frame of the car was criticized as not being designed for production. Gave lots of tips as to how that could be improved. Lots of us want @Tesla to be better than we can imagine. https:// youtu.be/Lj1a8rdX6DU

Tesla customers sell Teslas to friends & strangers. How could that happen if there was a problem with quality? #Tesla is NOT spending $5 BILLION per year on advertising but ~ZERO. @Tesla makes cars that are good enough to sell themselves. $ TSLA Not: #TheSociopathicBusinessModel
Looking around at all the electric vehicles available... Why does @Tesla just beat every other car manufacturer in every category? Only thing that comes close in range is a bolt but it looks like a turd on wheels and is no where near as quick.

@elonmusk @tesla Incorporating a drive mode that was for bumper to bumper traffic that would press and let go of the brakes for a driver as long one hand is one the wheel could be great idea. Also having a feature where I can afford one would be sweet.
@Tesla you've seriously disappointed me. I haven't received my official license plates and there's a chance they won't arrive before my temporary ones arrives and no one seems to realize that it's a problem #dissapointed

@elonmusk @Tesla Having someone run into my now 12-day-old M3 takes a bit of joy out of the experience, but at least no one was hurt. They say it may not be fixed until January, but I'm hoping for sooner. I do love that car!

@elonmusk @Tesla @Gfilche Shareholder vote to raise capital for European gigafactory now? 3/Y/Semi are going to dominate Europe with 2-3x higher fuel prices. Many shareholders want to see faster growth now that we know the method is profitable. Just learn from mistakes and expand
Prediction: Similar to what @tesla did with Model S, Model 3 Standard Range will be a software limited version of Mid Range version. Owners will be offered ability to upgrade SR to MR, unlocking more range & faster AC charging. Is this what you have in mind @elonmusk ?
Tesla is full of promise and innovation, no matter what the naysayers(shorters) say. It's going to be great watching @Tesla mature and continue to lead the cars of the future that traditional automakers told us that we didnt want (GM)

Every few decades the world gets a set of leaders and CEOs that change it in a significant way. @elonmusk is one of those people. Each @Tesla added to the road is reducing carbon emission a little. Hope more car makers join the party. Competition is the mother of invention!
Yup. Just don't know why @elonmusk and @Tesla haven't looked into it. No prob even if they do by 2024-2025. They need to be well established first
@elonmusk "What goes up, must come down!" I just realised that the @SpaceX @Tesla Roadster has gone up and will NEVER come down.

@Tesla closed 9% up. @elonmusk Wonder how high the stock has to go before all the shorts either go broke or all hit their safety bail-out point.
@elonmusk @Tesla you guys need to calm down with the price changes. Giving people crazy buyer's remorse in a week.
Hi sir @elonmusk when will @tesla arrive in INDIA . Please save us from pollution. We are 140cr people . U need more manufacturing units to serve us.
Looks like I'm a proud owner of a $5,000 depreciation thanks to the price drop on my #tesla #model3 performance. @tesla and @elonmusk please compensate early adopters and not punish them. $500 is ok. $5,000 is not.
If attempting to influence share prices is a major crime in USA, then Wallstreet Journal clearly is a misfit and a lawbreaker and should be prosecuted! @Tesla Last uprearing of the Fossil Fuel Industry!
Now that Teslas have this neat dashcam feature, new cars need a micro SD card slot. It'll be a cheap improvement, and we need those two USB plugs for other devices. Also, easier to find write-reliable SDs than USB drives. cc @elonmusk @Tesla

@elonmusk If the Arseholes of Wallstreet sense a weakness in yourself, they will try to repeat any successful blow. If you feel sure about your legal position, I wonder if not waiting for a judge's sentence is more adviseable than making deals which weaken @Tesla .
You would think there would be an incentive program to buy an all electric car like @Tesla or @toyota Prius for someone like me who drives 500+ miles a week for work. You care about the environment, right? Well a new car is very expensive #tesla #environment @elonmusk @joerogan
@elonmusk @Tesla Just took delivery of my M3 performance last week only to find out today the performance package upgrade is included now. Is it too late?
Electric auto brand @Tesla said it signed an agreement recently to secure land in Shanghai for its first factory outside the United States, pushing ahead with development despite mounting U.S.-Chinese trade tensions. http:// ow.ly/U5AK30mo0Ko pic.twitter.com/AnquxWziF6
not against @Tesla , but why didn't Tyler The Creator's Model X automatically slow down/stop before crashing? I know it probably wasn't in AP but it still shouldve seen that it was about to hit something right?
@HyperChangeTV @elonmusk Once @tesla comes out with their @uber equivalent, Tesla owners will have huge deduction of 55 cents a mile whenever their car is out working. Eg Tesla self driving rideshare income is likely to be mostly tax free. What do you think?

A big thanks to @Tesla London/Gatwick for the high standard of service given yesterday especially as i was a month early for my appointment . Thankyou #MyTesla.
Sir, Did you ever considered to do army vehicles? It seems like @tesla is very good at safety.
So this happened today. Pre-owned @Tesla S 85D! Super excited to finally own one. @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/jt3molMKWO

Totally agree to your point. Just that just like as many @Tesla fans buy the technology irrespective the price point, there is market to sway the once who maximizing the benefit transitioning to a right economy. Above all Tesla truly hold on price in seconds market.
Nav on AP was a tad awkward during today's trip on 2018.42.2, but overall it worked pretty well. Nice improvement, @Tesla !
Maybe @Tesla can take a note and add Twilio flex as a feature going forward....acheive true mobility with technology

Great new feature! @Tesla and @elonmusk keeps pushing the envelope and leading us onto the future! Shout out to all devs on the Tesla team they don't get enough of the spotlight.

My @Tesla Model 3 is reporting incorrect range since the v9 update, with a full charge showing 250 miles instead of 310-ish. But the battery percentage, as viewed in the charge limit, is right on after I've driven a bit. Feels like a software bug. Support waits are 1 hr on phone.
@Tesla why no one pick the phone for 40 min!!!
That was too fast to see the part where they wouldn't sit still. You could barely tell you had 5 pets in there. But thank that was sweet. You have two @Tesla #ElectricVehicles ? Good for you! Going green!
@Tesla rudest sales person at the Burbank store just now. Unbelievable
@Tesla can u guys lend a car? ima need one soon
@Tesla somehow placed 2 orders for a model 3 by mistake. I'm keeping 1 order but I'm being told that I'll have to wait 45 days for a refund on the second order. Now a good way to start a relationship #Tesla #ElonMusk #Model3 #CustomerService

@elonmusk Oh my god I just changed my mind, @Tesla needs a cute anime girl mascot.
Well, @tesla is aware then. With purchase records, finding people potentially impacted should be easy. Yikes I would be mad. It's one thing to delay the release, I'm ok waiting, but to cancel or take away!
Hi @Tesla Took a test drive and was blown away! BUT...... All that tech and no dash cams recording? #AllIWantForChristmasIsATesla
Great news! Maybe also focus on countering the many false narratives competitors spread, like those ads for Toyota/Lexus hybrids. They mislead people into thinking their hybrids are superior. A pathetic stab at @Tesla . Model 3 succes greatly helps but more education would be
@Tesla can save you all
@elonmusk @Tesla please put chargers (of any kind) over @RooseveltField in Garden City, NY.
Configured/ordered #teslamodel3 Sep 13, took delivery of P3D+ on Sep 27. Today marks one month and 2,680 miles (including one road trip Maryland to New York and back) of experience. Love this thing. All of it. Well done @tesla @elonmusk ! pic.twitter.com/T9POLgnweD
Is that a goodbye to @Tesla loosing money times?
well. I deployed flex from the Model 3 successfully, but the @tesla browser doesn't support HTML5, so I can't use that to be a nomadic agent. Boo.
I think #TwilioFlex is the first contact center platform that was successfully deployed from a @Tesla . I think @calozpom is bored on a Saturday. pic.twitter.com/MppAuFNlSf
Great work @Tesla Team!
Just like the dishonest commercials for Lexus hybrids, I just saw one for a Toyota hybrid. The motto went something like "no need to plug in, the car will charge itself". Deceitful, desperate & pathetic. So much for Japanese being honorable @ToyotaMotorCorp @Lexus @Toyota @tesla .

Is this happens @Tesla would jump to $700. That a problem for you I understand #Tsla
They were talking on Twitter... I highly doubt Elon was offended. If Elon is constantly surrounded by people that always agree with him, do we get a better product? IMO @elonmusk should hire @FredericLambert to work for @Tesla to keep things real.
My (admittedly late) congratulations to @elonmusk and @tesla for a fantastic third quarter!
@tesla I noticed Full AutoPilot is no longer offered on the Model 3 when configuring online. At the SF store today I was told it may never be offered in the future on the midrange or any model 3. Do current owners know about this? Looks like a big bait-n-switch.
That test drive sold me...just ordered my Model 3! @Tesla @elonmusk
