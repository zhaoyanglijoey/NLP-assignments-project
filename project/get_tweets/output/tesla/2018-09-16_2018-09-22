one of the many reasons to hate @Tesla - the transition to electrified vehicles could have been an opportunity to transition away from the sad toxic masculinity of rev heads - quiet cars with the kinds of lower torque that afford more cooperative driving

You where @SpaceX headquaters, thats a huge step in helping me, mabe you could ask that employees that invited you to SpaceX to tell him about me, there is so much you could do, working hard for myself will not help, I have my reasons why I chose @Tesla , trust me.
Tesla makes me consider going back to being a mechanic. Though it would almost be starting from scratch, the mechanics of @Tesla EV are pretty fascinating.
#elonmusk @elonmusk can you make my @Tesla refuse to get closer than few inched to any object when parking or backing up? After which you could display a slider to bypass the feature on the screen for that instance. Saves lots of little dings on bumpers

The only reason outside collision pros, at least reputable ones, would take weeks is due to @Tesla inability to supply the necessary parts.

@Tesla I understand the lifetime free supercharging program must end, but for happy customers that supported the company by reserving Model 3 in 2016 should be able to buy or upgrade to it so we can tell more people. Also since our warranty is not 8yr/unlimited.

What may be a differentiator for @tesla is their vertical integration. A Tesla is the MacBook of cars. Main parts produced by one company rather than bought wholesale. This is the part that Big Car Corp won't be able to copy easily.
Electricity or performance will not be a @Tesla differentiator in the 5 to 10 year term. Electricity will be a commodity which Big Car Corp can buy from the lowest cost supplier.
@Tesla - your Downers Grove facility need severe help with order and delivery! Customer service is a huge miss!
. @elonmusk I was saddened to read the DOJ is investigating after your @Tesla company claims of taking company private st $420/share. Manipulate stock prices much? So sad u distract from ur own products.
Hi @Tesla . My 8 year old son is obsessed with your cars. He spent $45 of his own money to buy a Tesla sweatshirt from your site. The one we ordered is too small. I've sent two emails asking about exchanging with no response from you. What's the deal?

@elonmusk @Tesla I didn't hear from my advisor until 24 hours before delivery. Trade in pending for 7+ days. No purchase agreement. Then I found out my car is still in Fremont and has to be pushed back multiple weeks. All just 24 hours before delivery. This needs to be fixed.
I think I uncovered a massive design flaw in the Model 3. Due to location of batteries, it must be creating an electromagnet every time you hit the gas. My phone, change, and anything else anywhere loose, ends up on the floorboard in back. @Tesla @elonmusk @Model3Owners pic.twitter.com/ZbwZNbD1PR

@elonmusk @Tesla told me two weeks ago that I was going to take delivery of a model 3 at 11 AM this Thursday. I just got a call from Tesla a few mins ago stating that they will call me in the next FEW WEEKS to let me know when I can expect to get the car. Not cool!
@elonmusk all BS aside, @Tesla needs to start pumping out cars like nothing els. Cause competition is coming, the early bird gap is closing.
@Tesla @elonmusk hopefully you can incorporate a feature to us Model X owners with the seven seat configuration that don't have the 2nd row fold flat option to disable the second row seats unlatched warning if we're hauling large/long cargo.

That's trickle down economics. Never has worked. Never will. Any company that removes people from the process is to blame. Volvo are doing just that. @Tesla are not doing it with their trucks despite having the most competent and widely used autopilot. Why? Bad for people.
hey @elonmusk @Tesla could you provide a bit more info about the #gigafactory fire? Was any machinery damaged? Is production back up at 100% of pre-fire level? Is there any supply chain disruption? $ tsla $ tslaq
@elonmusk I would like to share my proposal on a pediatric vehicular heatstroke prevention system (PVHPS) for @Tesla cars. PVHPS if implemented would prevent death of children due to hot cars. Please DM me if you are intrigued.

Why is @Tesla using Ford vans. Doesn't this just defeat the purpose of what tesla is aiming for. Which is Greener vehicles. This is the just so weird...
I think if they had given it a better design a new body style even I would look into purchasing. Hands down @Tesla is the way to future. Changing the Body style in the near future will definitely increase buyers. Tesla Roadster I got my Eye's On
@elonmusk , im disappointed on the customer service provided by @Tesla Littleton, CO store.

I am particularly unhappy about Lachlan Murdoch being on @Tesla 's Board of Directors. A son to a media mogul who's main mission seems to be to wield power and spread propaganda. It doesn't quite align the @elonmusk and customers values I would have thought.

I hope @Tesla takes the clip from that late night show where Bob Lutz laughed at the Tesla Roadster and pointed to his corvette, then shows another clip of the new Roadster racing the new ZR1.
Dear journalists. Every electric car launch is not a @Tesla killer. It is another nail in the coffin of decrepid internal combustion engines.
@elonmusk @Tesla Should Model 3 cars get the titanium underbody plate? Can it be an optional upgrade?
@Tesla how many charging stations are there in va per area #tesla #VirginiaBeach #Norfolk #Chesapeake #NewportNews #Portsmouth
How many times has @Tesla gone bankrupt? Crushed an entire model line of electric cars (that were made to prove BEVs are unfeasible)? Been bailed out by US gov't? What does Lutz rhyme with, again?

@Tesla driving a @Ford ... Interesting.
From history many will go broke Cory. @NIOGlobal do have some very big backers and unlike other Chinese EV manufacturers have developed the right way with patience. So, yes that's possible but then so is it possible with @Tesla . Time will tell as competition hots up.

Hello @Tesla and @elonmusk is the Model 3 designed with the intention of aftermarket undercarriage anti-rust protection for salty road protection during winter since its made of steel?
@Tesla is the way to go! Flying cars won't help that problem either.. @Uber @elonmusk
If @elonmusk let @boblutz run @Tesla sure it will be headed to graveyard like he did to @GM in 2009.

Ya... Everyone who agrees with the @Tesla mission statement is on their payroll. Whatever it takes for your version of reality to never be challanged by anyone who expresses support for something you disagree with. Are you a short spreading FUD? Should I just assume that also?
All this negative news about @Tesla and Elon possibly going to jail, etc I find mind boggling silly - but it's slowly starting to make me worry, albeit just little, if my #Model3 will be supported in the future. It's too much negativity to ignore.

Bad form @Tesla . Not cool having someone show for an appt and wait for an hour and a half, only to be told their car is not there.

Complete believer in @Tesla but admit that this wait is frustrating! Worse is seeing people with the same config as me getting their cars first. Come on @ElonMusk fix this!

Also most (all?) #CHAdeMo chargers do not reduce the per minute rate when charging slows down whereas (at least in Canada) @Tesla Superchargers charge one rate for fast charging and another (typically 1/2) when charging slows down. Much more fair if you want to charge to 100%.

Arrived @Tesla supercharger Worthington, MN. Drive is going well, traffic is not bad on the interstate and the only real weather is some wind which is calming down as I head west. pic.twitter.com/R30cNGyKA6
@elonmusk @Tesla Our Tesla was scheduled to be picked up today. Last night we were told it had not arrived. We haven't heard from delivery advisor. We had the financing and insurance done and made the down payment. Today we found out the VIN was switched and we're very frustrated
After owning a Model X for two month I think this image captures perfectly how "hard" it is to own an EV in 2018. Thanks @Tesla and @elonmusk for all the dedication that has made it possible. My daughter and I love "the car that can dance" (her words) pic.twitter.com/Dd9TaN6kpr

Went to the Tesla showroom to pickup my model 3. Had a volunteer/guest explain the features and he did a phenomenal job. Volunteer/guest name: Blake Rogers #ElonMusk #TeslaModel3 #tesla @elonmusk @Tesla
I agree. This is a great opp for @tesla approved clubs to show their value to the company. This should be a model @elonmusk and Co leverage and on in future.
I wonder if the @Tesla Gigafactory can go from Li-ion to Na-ion cells easily when the tech is viable? @elonmusk #tesla

@Tesla @elonmusk We were in a Model X in the showroom (what an awesome vehicle!) and I think the console has a typo. Instead of "Driving" it says "Diving." The new model can go underwater?! pic.twitter.com/t4Mea7NYF2
Rejected by the Banks to buy a Tesla because $ Crypto and #Bitcoin isn't "real" to them. @elonmusk when will Crypto currency be something that @Tesla will accept?
#EV are great. Hats off to taking the initiative to make them. Unfortunately none of the manufacturers are making them affordable for average buyers. @Tesla , @Nissan , @volvocars , @BMW , @MercedesBenz etc
Thank you Tesla for an amazing delivery day! The car is a dream come true! @Tesla @elonmusk #tesla pic.twitter.com/iw07jsFS5f
First @Tesla #Supercharger visit in my new #Model3 Performance - time running out to get free charging for life use my code - #Tesla https:// ts.la/joe24776 pic.twitter.com/EuUEFdnQcl
Make it happen! Love to see the amazing support of this community (followers of @SpaceX @elonmusk @Tesla ) to infinity and beyond!
We just figuratively smoked a Dodge Charger SRT that wanted to race. The Tesla Model 3 Performance left him in the dust. @elonmusk @Tesla But we need a Jesus handle on the passenger side.
@elonmusk @Tesla you should sell special edition tesla moon models. For ever so many thousand(s) sold is a chance to win a ticket to the moon . Price them little higher.

Places like hospitals and emergency services will really benefit from battery storage solutions that @elonmusk company @Tesla has installed in other hurricane prone areas for similar installations and even way bigger ones like those in South Australia
@NASA @elonmusk @Tesla imagine a Tesla semi capable of driving for 2 years without a recharge... Imagine charging stations everywhere without the need for any Electric Supply at all them... Imagine real working clean Fusion Energy. I know how.
@elonmusk @Tesla Rock & Roll rovers Two rovers land on asteroid, deliver pictures of asteroid surface.
@Tesla poke poke whisper whisper Hire Retirees who are Tesla owners to work part time doing delivery. They like getting paid less and not working as much because they are enjoying their retirement and social security. It will bring them such joy and feeling of worth and family
I hope to one day own some sort of @Tesla unless @elonmusk was willing to lend me one for a while!
@Tesla @GTAOnlineCom cough. u cant call urself a car company's if ur not emulated in gta.. I'm swinging for the semi
@GTAOnlineCom @Tesla ... cough. o ya and now I want the semi..
Thank you @elonmusk for turning my iPhone into a car. Dream come true @Tesla #modelS pic.twitter.com/08NcrUHtOs
Had VIN and delivery date on 9/25. Sold my car yesterday (only have 1 parking spot). Right after got a call that my Model 3 is delayed. Now I have no VIN, no delivery date, and NO CAR! Worst buying experience ever. Never thought I would miss going to dealership @elonmusk @Tesla
Current owner participation with @tesla 's end of quarter deliveries is going to blow people's minds. Mark my words.
@elonmusk Can @tesla publish the live GPS location of the Tesla Semi(s) plying the US roads, for enthusiasts (in 47 other states) to check them out while they are passing through their states?
At six PM on a Friday I doubt that many were employee cars. From what I read Tesla is running low on loaners so my guess is mostly waiting on service/repairs. Am I wrong? My short that you get P100D as loaners Ever thought of how expensive that is for @Tesla ? $ TSLAQ
One day I will own a @Tesla .
@Tesla requires the car be paid in full before delivery. I just purchased one. Same thing. Their car was probably ready for delivery so they squared up. However, who buys insurance before you have the car? Your insurance agent can bind your insurance on the way to pick it up.
Tesla super charging stations are effectively ruined by Model 3s w free super charging using local stations. Sad. An entire ecosystem for Tesla owners unfortunately laid to waste. Hope @elonmusk @Tesla have a plan to fix this
@Tesla @elonmusk will v9 offer cross traffic alert when reversing? I find this is a huge plus on any vehicle.

Just saw a @Tesla #Model3 in a rural area. So cool to see modern tech in the real world.

No sales pressure at all with @Tesla - my test drive was a totally no strings attached event here in Indianapolis. Props to the Indy SC crew.
@elonmusk - if you can spare a team member to setup a volunteer scheduling system, I'm sure we could assist. I absolutely believe it's critical for @Tesla to get through "delivery hell" and I'm happy to volunteer my time and knowledge to bring new owners up to speed!
MyPOV: four hours here and more chaotic than ever. @elonmusk you should come see it yourself. A few things to help you 1 better scheduling software 2 @DocuSign for your contracts 3 upfront training for the team not ad hoc 4 more color printers 5 more hands on deck @Tesla pic.twitter.com/LaGAtTp9UP
@elonmusk if @Tesla made a riding lawnmower, I would buy one.

Allz I kno is that @elonmusk and @Tesla makin mad numbers of crazy clean, crazy fast electric cars & delivering tens of thousands despite some of the most discerning customers on the planet. muss b they doin sumthin rite #hatersgonnahate #newcandybiz #Chanossuckers
Hi @elonmusk ! Im in love with @Tesla model 3 !!
Mr. @elonmusk , I exhausted all possible paths to meet your Business Development VP in order to share my ambitious and achievable proposal of creating a MENA expansion base for @tesla in Oman. I would be honored to meet with you in the US and extend an invitation for you to visit
Wrong. You sound like a @Tesla -only twitter bot, whose entire thread is about that car company, which thinks it's a tech company and deserves different valuation for its equity. Socialist market economy allows China and Venezuela to work dronish minions to the bone.
The actual driving, easy turns, acceleration and control @Tesla drives like a dream I think I drove the S type, look forward to test driving the actual model 3 when stateside
Why do I think everyone that owns a @Tesla is an asshole?

@Tesla why do I have to wait 1 hour to pick up my car when I arrive for an appt? This is super frustrating and the Tesla person I talked to had a bad attitude.
@Tesla has reintroduced their lifetime free super charging with a referral code http:// ts.la/david81500 #tesla hashtag#incentives until the end of the month. Non performance Model 3 can get 1 year free charging if they take delivery before the ned of the month. #tesla #model3
@elonmusk @Tesla @TeslaMotorsClub @TeslaRoadTrip Deep Blue (3P) arrived home today. Better than my wildest dreams. Thank you to everyone who designed, built & shipped this gorgeous car. Delivery team in MN was awesome P.S.There is still a spot left in the garage for the Roadster pic.twitter.com/cSEEJvQ3da
@elonmusk @Tesla Hey Elon and Tesla, I hear you could use some help in delivering the Model 3 lately. If I assist with your deliveries in Denver can I get a loaner while mine is repaired?
I recommend never bying something from fossil fuel car makers! Cheaters! Polluters, killers, buy from exclusive electric car makers for now only @Tesla is making it I am afraid!

Lack of working capital affected his non-delivery time, not the weather 3k miles away. That smug, distant, assuming and aloof treatment you received at @Tesla is all part of the brand and charm. @TiffanyAndCo sales folk are friendly & know they are selling something $$$. pic.twitter.com/jhL6AQG0RP
FYI. For those with the same issue... dealership was far more helpful than @Tesla support.
Just plugged into @Tesla supercharger Big Timber, MT. Have a quick 20 min charge here and I'm off to Bozeman, MT. pic.twitter.com/uphQICOqEK

. @Tesla cannot be the car company of the future until they follow today's workplace health and safety rules. This is just the latest horror story out of the Tesla factory. https:// read.bi/2MQTzMg #1u
Matching reality with fiction. With @Tesla all things are possible.
