@elonmusk who exactly are you having to pay $20m and what do they plan on doing with this money? $40m in fines between you and @Tesla could fix Flint's water or build my town new schools that meet safety codes.
. @elonmusk @tesla any chance of adding heated steering wheel to PUP on #Model3 at some point? Congrats on Q3!
@Tesla Please explain who the $40mil in fines between Tesla and Musk is being paid to. What is this fine going towards? As an American teacher who desperately wants to purchase a Tesla car someday, I'd like to know how they plan on using $40mil.
@elonmusk I never understood what made you so opposed to marketing to neglect it? @Tesla makes such amazing products and it's people are so awesome seems like a real shame not to capitalize on low hanging fruits, like people who visit site looking at specific models. Remarketing
Whoever said @Tesla and @elonmusk is operating on any kind of "strategy"?
Got to drive a @Tesla model 3 earlier tonight and I am still smiling.

@Tesla @elonmusk I understand that things are crazy at Quarter end, but why are people who reserved at me, and ordered after me getting the same config as mine before me when I don't even have a VIN yet? I even got "the text" only to be followed by a never mind text days later.
Hey @Tesla @elonmusk thanks for great experience picking up my new car today. Showed up - no car, poor excuses & no idea when or if I will get it - this after calling Friday to confirm - p*ss poor customer service - but hey met your production target #disgruntledshareholder
"Tesla asks employees to beta test its full self-driving system" this news is worth 100 billion. Morgan Stanley worths Waymo at 175 billion which uses LIDAR that is fragile, expensive and harmful to eyes. @Tesla has @OpenAI + their 5 billion miles data( +3 million per day).

Picked up my @Tesla model 3 awd today. Perfect experience! In and out in under 30 minutes. Thank you @elonmusk and team- this car is amazing.
The @Tesla #Roadster best time of the day was 69.592 sec.
@whatsmyeta are you going to add @tesla app as an available navigation app to select in settings. Would be hugely beneficial!!!
@Tesla this addition can boost the car sells. Including adding additional battery life to the attachment of the vehicle. #Adding battery life can propel sells even greater.
@Tesla Can have additional packages with the #vehicle itself. Like creating a #RV attachment to the #vehicle . Building the car where the #seats in the back flip and face the opposite side. The #RV attachment interlocks with the #vehicle .

Nothing great comes easy. I believe in you. So do billions of people. You are an admiration to all of us in this unjust world. You have a brilliant and beautiful mind. You are the boss of @Tesla and will prosper very soon.

@Tesla took my model 3 to fix some minor paint work and panel misalginments. In the meantime they gave me a F%$@$# Hyundai to drive. I hate this loaner car. 3 days for the work, not as quick as expected but at least they are taking care of everything.

The assumption that @tesla is vulnerable to other car manufacturers is flawed. ICE makers are at a huge disadvantage as they have so much invested in building engines. The best they can hope for is that the transition to EV happens much slower than it is currently tracking. $ tsla

Most depressing thing to think version 9 is deploying to your @Tesla model X and it's just another pin update.... pic.twitter.com/TPfq1XNytl
@Tesla what gives? Picking up a model 3, car is dirty inside, bird shit on the outside, I need to do a software update on my own, and you can't give me a fully charged battery? Unbelievable.
It takes a bit more than sketches, tweets + MAGA hat to make a car happen. Let @elonmusk help you to make it real with the @Tesla infrastructures and savoir-faire! It's all love when it comes to help great minds

@tesla @elonmusk Feature Request: Model 3: Can we get heated steering wheels? my 38k subaru has this and I love it. Surprsied my (far more expenisve) P3d doesn't.
@Tesla @elonmusk Feature Request: Can we get the ability to Roll up or down the windows via the Phone app?
why do @Tesla and @BMW drivers think they own the road
@tesla @elonmusk Feature improvement: Can we get Auto wipers to have (Variable sensitivity settings?). Maybe it already has them and I'm not familar how to do them. However my auto wipers seem a bit relaxed when its sprinkling outside.
@tesla @elonmusk Feature Request: Can we get Waze/integration overlay to google maps?

@tesla @elonmusk Feature Request: For people forgetting to turn off their turn signal? Can we get an update to If on more than x#of seconds then auto shut off?

From spending most of a day helping @Tesla at the end of the quarter... One thing that would probably surprise many people is that Tesla owners aren't exclusively wealthy people (anymore). They're just people. People filled with conviction and passion. Great people.
I suspect the motives behind those who have been trying to drive the fervor behind short-selling @Tesla , always have. Seems fishy they'd go after the first and only mass-producer of electric-only cars...

" @Tesla , under Mr. Musk, has been the single most significant force" driving the future of electric vehicles, writes @Wharton 's John Paul MacDuffie in this NYT opinion piece on the SEC settlement: https:// nyti.ms/2OvEuo0
I'm confused. If I read the shorts correctly, @Tesla is suppose to learn how to profitably make cars from these companies. I guess that's backwards.
@SEC_Enforcement , how are you guys not going after all these media for spreading fraud? They're costing @Tesla investors lots of money or do you only consider Tesla shorts investors?

I'm constantly asked, "How do you like your (ModelS)?" Well, since owning it I've driven a Mercedes, Jaguar, Infiniti and Chrysler (all 2016+), and was disappointed in all of them. @Tesla is the real deal.
Write off @elonmusk at your own peril @Tesla is one of best selling sedans of any category, period. Despite being only electric car in category and being as high priced as the model 3 is. Only Toyota and Honda with their cheap underpowered old models are higher in list.
So you are saying @tesla has a moat? How fun. What about the charging network?

I will own a @Tesla one day

Some fundamentals for @tesla #shortsellers . #Tesla Home wall charger and installation revenue growth, in car services revenue growth(that big ol tablet was not frivolous). A trillion dollar market cap in the somewhat not so distant future is more than capable. @elonmusk

While @Tesla struggles to move a million cars a year, @Toyota and @Ford move 15 million vehicles. Just saying. A car can cost $60,000 and only 10 cars need to be sold. A car can cost $15,000 and needs to be sold 4x times more.

the reality is that the trajectory was headed 420 *before* he tweeted that......... and the news for @Tesla has only gotten better since then. fundamentals say 420 is inevitable. imo if you can't afford to sit on it you shouldn't buy it.

1/2 Oil gives us quality of life right now, not some vague promise that it would do in some ever delayed future which never materializes, nobody attacked @tesla as long as they kept producing expensive golf karts for people insulated in their bubble of wealth,
Some positive news: Diesel demand peaked in China, Gas by 2025. Oil demand in USA so sluggish a mere 300k EVs would wipe it out and stagnate demand. Tesla Model 3 alone can do that within their projected growth timeline of 3 years. @Tesla
Dear @elonmusk tomorrow we start making boxes for @Tesla . Does this mean that we get a discount on your cars? Sincerely 600 very curious Pratt Valparasio employees hahaha.

You would think everyone who shells out several thousand dollars for a feature would do some research to first understand what they are buying but it's clear that isn't always the case. So forced training would be a good way for @Tesla to ensure customers are informed.
