@Tesla @elonmusk a service call/tech support callback feature would be nice, holding for 30-40 mins for a quick 3 minute question is a bit rediculous.
Ted gave us a test ride in his new(ish) @Tesla Model 3. I also drove it a bit and then let the car drive us on its own for a bit too. This is a pretty nice car - I can see why people like it so much. pic.twitter.com/UHSXmQ6Lcw

As an example, it appears that there are always multiple levels of thinking and future-proofing in @Tesla products. The control software and algorithms for the powerpack plants seem to make the absolute most of the storage. Others just provide storage and leave control to others.
@elonmusk @Tesla how about a setting to adjust auto windshield wiper sensitivity in M3. Mine is too insensitive, have to manually engage it too often.
How green is your @Tesla ? Brad Cornell, Economics Professor at @CalTech , entered his Model S into a head-to-head competition with his son's 2015 @Toyota Prius. Here's how the two cars stacked up. http:// bitly.com/2AtZLXl pic.twitter.com/LmnAHIGBS9

@Tesla @elonmusk So I picked up my M3 yesterday. Things went smoothly at the delivery location. Corey(Charlotte,NC) was extremely helpful and very pleasant. The car is amazing.
Which @tesla employee was interviewed by FBI. Link? Without proof its a lie and manipulation.
@tesla just got the long range AWD model 3 with autopilot and sport wheels. Looks like price is now 2k less for that configuration less than 2 weeks after I took delivery. I saw refunds for performance people, what about those in my situation?
Like to report that he now finally has his beautiful red Model 3D and he loves it. @Tesla sometimes makes it really difficult to get a Tesla, but the Tesla itself more than makes up for it.

Well... yes, but... the base price went up by more than $4,000.00 CDN. I know because I got caught in the price change between my first configuration (7-seater) and my modified configuration (6-seater). Moreover, we lost the free lifetime streaming! Still happy to support @Tesla .

Thanks ! Very ignorant & very sad ! They also attack @elonmusk @Tesla because @SpaceX designs re-usable rockets, Industry likes to burn every launch & build a new one w/ new Contract, totally corrupt & wasteful.
For comparison, I updated my @Tesla from my phone today Free shipping included

@elonmusk leaves @Tesla . thank you boss! for everything on Earth... rendez-vous on Mars!
@elonmusk @Tesla in HK, the tax is 100%+ of vehicle price. So we wish to buy autopilot but will not, bcoz of the high tax. We have to buy it after delivery in order to save tax. Can we have a grace period to buy autopilot with original price?

@Tesla What's up with your website. I am no longer able to book service appointments online and your hold times have been in excess of 20 minutes. Not good.
@elonmusk Can you or @Tesla confirm when the deliveries of Model 3 will begin to Europe? More specific than "first half of 2019". The start of the new year is right around the corner...
Hey @elonmusk hope your well wondering if we could see a @Tesla powerwall 3 in the near future?
Fortunately some of us were right about @Tesla finances & future prospect. TSLA was not selling EVs at a loss. The so-called losses was because fixed cost/car is always high when production volume is small. With prod ramp In Q3 losses reversed to profit as fc spread on more units
Trying to work from the @Tesla service center but can't get on the VPN because their free wi-fi is blocking anything on the http:// netflix.com domain

F150 is the king of pick up trucks 20 years running once @Tesla pickups trucks are available guess what going to happen. 300,000 towing capacity campers to 60.000 for f150 is going to be blood bath and Ford cannot survive with all the profit from it is trucks.

A brief thread on how different hardware and software are: My company makes both custom hardware and custom software. The hardware is toys, not rockets like @SpaceX or cars like @Tesla , but stuffed animals and construction toys. 1/n
@Tesla warranty states that "Using the vehicle as a stationary power source" violates the warranty... I wonder if that would still stand for when the Tesla pick-up comes out...
@DMC_Ryan anyone else get this? @tesla is guaranteeing, at least west coasters, delivery within a month. Less if they pickup from Fremont. You think a last minute push? pic.twitter.com/jp7xQWvIgm

Hey @elonmusk , don't you think it's time for @Tesla to develop a Smart (TM) competitor?
@Tesla has always been ahead from a technology perspective. The competition was supposed to catch up,. In fact, Tesla's lead is accelerating like a next gen Roadster.
@MazdaAus such a shame carplay isn't an OTA update for vehicles or at least offered for free. Have you guys even seen what @Tesla is up to?

Yeah my fear is that @tim_cook wouldn't know what to do with @Tesla innovation.
Isn't it more polluting than just driving to a dealership/associated garage once the flat tire is repaired? Is the van electric? Plus it adds vehicles on congested roads... Imho... I still like @tesla cars btw!

@Tesla , I put a deposit down on the Model 3 on day 1 (UK), but then pulled out and bought Model S instead. If I then reserve a Model 3 again (can't have enough Teslas!), do I go to the back of the queue?

I wonder what would happen if @Tesla teamed up with @Sony to create an amazing electric car with an equally amazing sound system. Unless it's been done, because I'd like to see that.
I think @elonmusk and @Tesla could do amazing things with large amounts of cash. 1. Supersonic electric VTOL vehicle 2. More production of all $ TSLA vehicles 3. Gigafactories around the world 4. Solve #ClimateChange
@Tesla Service needs to be more upfront. If my car is going to sit in your lot and bake in the sun for 4 days in the queue for diagnostics I would have rather brought it in in 3-4 days time and driven my own car and not a loaner. #TeslaServiceFail
