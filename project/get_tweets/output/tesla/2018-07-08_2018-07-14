Cant wait to win the lottery so i can buy a @Tesla Model X. @elonmusk Would 100% help if i put the lottery on, just not a lucky individual so id rather not waste my money putting it on
@elonmusk @Tesla would be nice if there was a way to turn off Autosteer while leaving TACC engaged, maybe a double pull on the stalk to engage and another double pull to disengage.
My next car will be a @tesla #ivedecided #thefuture

Interesting to see how much market share @tesla is taking from BMW and Merc, but barely affecting the others. It looks like a lot of people who like to drive are choosing Model 3.

Hey @elonmusk was curious if the aerodynamic benefits of a @Tesla Model S/3/X convoy have been studied?
@elonmusk @Tesla what does an aspiring driver gotta do to get a car? All jokes aside I love you guy's cars especially the model s
Road trips are easy with so many @Tesla superchargers around
@elonmusk @Tesla model S refresh anytime soon?

Hey @Tesla extremely frustrated by the misinformation I was given by one of your reps, I was told I could make a change to the build without any delays as long as it was before the VIN was assigned. All I want to do is change the color w/o delay, I am hopeful someone can help.

I would love to work for @Tesla and @elonmusk don't have the background. Definitely have the attitude. Great company and dood
@elonmusk When ordering my Model 3, the website gave a delivery estimate of 3-6 weeks. 6 weeks complete today. I haven't heard from @Tesla . Didn't expect such a well reputed company to give false promises.
Wondering if the Aulac, NB Supercharger would be open at the beginning of August. Looks like that pending Supercharger will be the decision between taking our Model S or Civic on road trip to Halifax NS? @elonmusk @Tesla

@lopezlinette my humble opinion - the job you're given to dig dirt out of @Tesla and @elonmusk is like trying to get oil from a water well. You may find miniscules. BUT IS IT REALLY WORTH YOUR TIME? How about say, how else can we reduce lung cancer besides stopping smoking?

@Tesla I love my #powerwalls and the ability to use them for backup when power goes out. I would love if the Tesla app could alert me to it being used for backup so I could go and use my Nest app to turnoff AC so can power essentials. @elonmusk
I hope your work (in part) inspires @Tesla to offer a RACE/TRACK mode (selectable from touch screen) for the #PerformanceModel3 that will loosen up (or outright) disable stability control, traction control etc. in the proper circumstances. Could be available via OTA update #P3D
@Tesla When did Tesla sell it's 200,000th car in the USA? Did the roll-off of Federal Tax incentives get triggered in Q2 or Q3?

I'm pretty sure there must be tech to stop it already but that won't help sell cars, or a brave move by a manufacturer @Tesla

@elonmusk @Tesla @ABBRobotics @BBCClick #supercharger #uk please consider building a charger coupling point, tht can be located under the car, near pavement height. So a robot arm, can auto plug into cars. so pavements are not pollute charger units. WiFi elec, losses be to high
On the sub, the technical rescue leader told him to do it, and later confirmed for them to continue. On the car, a dead load was necessary and using his car was 1) cheaper than a scratch-built load 2) incalculable marketing for @Tesla - a company that doesn't market.

@elonmusk @GreyhoundBus just announced that they're cancelling all bus routes in British Columbia (save one). I think this is a prime opportunity for electric to step in. Can @Tesla make a coach bus design based on the semi-truck concept? #cdnpoli

I found the segment completely dishonest & one-sided. We know everyone wants to compare Tesla to big tech companies but its just getting out of startup. Your attack on the GA line showed you are clueless. CNBC - what a disappointment. @Tesla and @elonmusk should have responded.
I don't know about #MartinTripp 's allegation of #Tesla installing faulty batteries in cars. Why would #ElonMusk or his agents knowingly install faulty batteries in cars that could leak & result in several problems (including death), thus huge liability to @Tesla ? #Technology

@Tesla @elonmusk can we PLEASE have the calendar app in the model 3. It makes the entire mobile experience seamless. PLEASE
Bureaucracy. Our corrupt government gave a small company the contract to repair Puerto Rico's power grid after @elonmusk offered a superior solution. Although not on the governmental level, @Tesla powerpacks currently part of projects all over the island.
Well, this isn't good @elonmusk . Very serious allegations here. If any of these r true @Tesla is done.

Exactly -time for these climate cult asshats to put thier money where their mouth is & stop pulling it from our asses - be hero & buy an overpriced overhyped same carbon footprint as a gas car @tesla with your own money & stop demanding tax payers subsidize their BS
Aren't you afraid that they won't let you past the borders of West LA now that you have rejected @Tesla ?
My dream vehicle would be if @Ford and @Tesla could make an all electric F-150...and add in a Ludacris Edition... For Science!
You are such a cynical bitch. Man just started selling a 30k economical fully electric vehicle with a full body and 300 mile range. @Tesla gave away research to encourage EV competitors, and now there's a thriving EV industry, and hope for a future. What have you done?
