What is so special about @Tesla car design? The *inside* is clearly revolutionary, the *outside* is incremental design.

@Tesla Model 3 - I just picked it up!
Hey idiots ... the point of Autopilot is that there is no need for a reaction from the driver because it is allready a better driver than human. @elonmusk @Tesla $ tsla $ tslaq
Shoulda had a @Tesla battery.
One thing that will help them grower quicker than expected is during next recession, several OEM's will fail and @Tesla will scoop up on the CHEAP.

@elonmusk can I get a @Tesla with a feature that arrives with my dog in the car to pick me up from the airport?
@elonmusk you can send a roadster to space, land two rockets simultaneously, but the transfer of ownership process that @Tesla has is horrendous, a simple web form would be far more simple and probably take less time to complete, just a thought of course

Crazy how the new @Tesla runs off 100% renewable big dick energy!!
Driving a @Tesla is my own private Idaho then. Right now I feel like getting my freak on
Besides their debt that's about the only thing they could beat @Tesla with. That is...where can you load at that speed? Not at home you can't.....nor at the thousands of Tesla stations....Porsche loading infrastructure, yeah right...
Me too. Wish I could create a template and save/reuse. @elonmusk @Tesla Would be great for parents or kids at heart.
Because we didn't give billions to @Tesla . We gave billions to help get us off our dependence on foreign oil - which has caused far too many wars. Building trains would cost trillions more and take far longer.. and if you needed oil to do it, we'd be at war and burn up first!

@elonmusk @Tesla I love the auto wipers on my Model 3 but I always seem to wish they were one notch faster then what the car sets them to. Can we get an auto wiper "aggressiveness" setting?
Jaguar will have a hard time justifying the premium price it has set for I-Pace if its 90kWh battery is getting an EPA range of 234 miles. Lower energy Model X 75D has 238 miles. Not exactly hitting the the street running, Competition with @Tesla #ModelX will be an uphill task.
Took couple of my friends to test drive Tesla Model 3 MR, both of them are super interested. One of them will order this week For myself, just ordered 2X Model 3 MR today at the @Tesla shop for my company use. Thanks @elonmusk for the great deal !! $ TSLA pic.twitter.com/IVnsGOUkfx
@Tesla Can you make your cars like 40$ tryna save the planet over here
@elonmusk can @Tesla make a school bus? That would be cool
@elonmusk can the dashcam have a feature where if it detects an accident to automatically save the prior 10 minutes like when you push the button to save? Thanks for the awesome @Tesla car #elonmusk #tesla
@Tesla has a better one pic.twitter.com/khyVWZEZxp
To add to that - Tesla has the lowest battery cost in the world, so they will maintain that lead for another 3-5 years. If anything, other costs per car will come down as they catch up with legacy autos. By the time the competition catch up, @Tesla will have innovated further.
That's where you're wrong! There is a huge moat - the supercharger network. No charging network will be as large for at least the next 3 years even if @Tesla STOPS building more chargers today. Today, I can drive a Tesla cross country - I cannot do that in a Jag/Audi/Merc EV.
@elonmusk bring us @Tesla Model 3 with native fast #CCS and supercharging to Europe!

We can learn a thing or two about #compliance from @Tesla and their recent issues with managing their CEO, @ElonMusk . #VendorManagement can be challenging, but managing a CEO with so much power without any compliance standards is risky. @RadicalCompliance https:// bit.ly/2yVEF27
We've been in contact with at least one automaker about this. The interest is there; convergence is inevitable. @Tesla seems to be far and away the leader in auto tech.
Wow in the UK so don't need a ride, also i love the @Tesla but would rather a ride in your other car hehe
@Tesla I want a Tesla
@Tesla FUDs are in full force today after seeing $ TSLA down for the first time since the day before Q3 earnings.

@elonmusk Worst experience of my life: breast cancer diagnosis, 2nd worst: buying from @tesla Car buying disaster in N.C. No accountability
Yes - the stock market looks forward not backwards. People are giving credit to traditional auto makers for catching up to Tesla which is a way more dangerous assumption than @tesla getting base to $35k. New Corolla has a low cost of ownership but high cost of boring as fuck.
Hahaha that is so ghetto! @MercedesBenz has to do a lot better than that! Burning #Petrol , #gas and #diesel pollutes the environment and it costs ! Secondly too many buttons and the display is like from the 80's +nav. @Tesla is coming for you, #model3 2019 in the UK. Bye!

@Tesla From 214 point inspection to 70 point inspection for a CPO Tesla Model S, what's amiss? Is Tesla cutting corners despite the opportunity to make a profit on a car a second time? Kindly clarify please. Thanks!
Maybe we can ask @elonmusk if he can get you and the dope from @vox a seat in the next @Tesla he launches.
*Follow up* I called @Tesla after work and they seem to feel that the 14 day trial was an error. They said that everybody should be getting 30 day as of right now. They asked me to send a picture of what my pop-up look like on my screen. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/F2UOyfuBWo

Quick @Tesla @elonmusk diversion AHA! moment: Current on-ramp to off-ramp autonomous driving is EXACTLY what is needed for the Boring Co. Tunnels. They could do it NOW. AND...control all the traffic and regulations. FFS the level of thinking going on is just unbelievable.
@elonmusk just a little advice from a fan, @Tesla should partner with @Waymo .You focus on the car and waymo on self-driving tech.Both could benefit from one another,it's the best solution to stay ahead & reduce the costs.Thank me later ;) #tesla #ElonMusk #TeslaModel3 #waymo
what is Elon Musk doing @Tesla
I'd dig a @Tesla that was dead simple. Dials, tires, batteries and a motor.. Some nice speakers. Good range, fast and simple af.

@elonmusk @Tesla Elon I know you said people with M3P+ could get 5k back if they drop unlimited SC. My only issue is at .26 cents per KW 5k worth of SC is 19,230 KW seems to me i am better off taking the money. That's over 200 charges to full in the model 3. Thoughts?
A bit stressed out today at work, blessed that I have my Model 3 ride waiting. Driving experience is actually very therapeutic. Many thanks to @Tesla team!
@tesla Thanks for arranging to change my screen and letting me know a ranger can come to my house to repair it. No other car I have ever owned has repaired my car on my driveway!Special thanks to the Dartford service centre and hopefully the part comes in soon! #tesla #modelx
Critics should give it up. @Tesla Q3 record earnings was as clean as it gets. Look at change in cash from Q2 - ties with free cashflow and that's all matters to auditor. Critics estimate of Q3 off by wide margin. Brush up on accounting and fin analysis and they may get Q4 right.
Dear @Tesla @elonmusk Why is it sooooooo hard to get your Delivery Advisor to respond??? Are they all taught to do that to your customers or is she just a bad apple in the bucket???

As a physician, I find Dr. Besh's remarks highly credible. @Tesla TY for the update.
The problem with electric cars is the entire car needs to be new. The battery weight needs to be in the floor and does not lend itself to current car designs. Just look at @Tesla and how they changed the layout. They can't just drop in batteries and motors and be cool as I can.

There is no reason to extend them. @Tesla cars are better than combustion engine cars. Thus the incentive is no longer needed for consumers to buy - Tesla can't even fill demand. The combustion engine is a dying technology in cars.
. @KatieCheetham96 just gave me the greatest compliment of my life. She said that @elonmusk tweets a lot like I do. How incredible it is to be compared to the creator of @Tesla and @boringcompany . The creator of my dream car and my dream flame thrower.
Does any1 else listen to the classical stations in their @Tesla ? That playing with EAP activated makes for a relaxing, almost stress free commute home in bumper to bumper traffic.
Have you filed complaints with @FTC and @bbb_us ? If you don't act and just whine, @Tesla and Musk will keep scamming more customers and other parties.
Love the car service was horrible today. Trying to decide if I want to try to buy another one or not. Would just love some level of service. @elonmusk @Tesla
Agreed. A piece of the supply chain at a time until the whole picture is integrated. Companies like @ToyotaMotorCorp @UnipartGroup @Tesla and @BMW have been doing part Industry 4.0 for a decade or more. Smart cities have undertaken years of planning to setup in that manner. Walk!

This is not an isolated thing, dude. The cars are simply not safe, nor being built well. And how do I get through a day, lol? Not at all faint of heart. Just sick of watching this @tesla fraud..from accounting, to endangering their workforce, to scamming the customer.

Dear @Tesla @elonmusk Why is it sooooooo hard to get your Delivery Advisor to respond??? Are they all taught to do that to your customers or is she just a bad apple in the bucket???
@FBI is it true that the FBI is investigating @Tesla over the Model 3? Because if it is, you guys would have to answer why they weren't investigated over the Model S, Model X, or the Roadster. None of those cars met production deadlines or targets either.

That would be pretty cool, but I would LOVE for @Tesla to add the ability to tap the battery to QC other EVs. This ability would make LOTS of friends of other EV drivers since any Tesla could act as a "mobile fuel can". Tesla drivers large LOVE helping other people drive electric

Just saw a man standing in the road yelling at his wife (she was in the driver's seat of their @Tesla , stopped) : This is ridiculous! Unlock the door! It's right on the screen. : hella confused : This is ridiculous! You have to learn how to open the doors : leans across
@Tesla Did you just jack up the price of the Wall Connectors by 27% ?
Congratulations @Tesla !

Final version of features should never be dependant on specific map zones. If I can drive anywhere, @Tesla should be able to learn to drive there too. I live in a small town 20 miles from Madrid in Spain, @Tesla is my only option for autonomous driving, and it does great!
Dear @elonmusk ... All I want for is the biggest @Tesla short squeeze in the history of short squeezes. I would also like my gift early, sayyyyyy, next week. Xoxo
Let us help @Tesla in training the AP Neural Networks: * Signaling zones that needs improvements * Labeling images of our daily commute * Use our Tesla's CPUs and KWh when it is parked to accelerate training
Please contact dpo@tesla.com -- they are obligated to notify the data breach to the Dutch authorities in a matter of days -- facing a penalty of up to 20 mln euros.
No, but I do plan on going to the media if @Tesla or @elonmusk doesn't reach out to me to discuss what happened.

Elon, are @Tesla cars @DARPA plasma resistant? Why trees burn from inside out?

. @Tesla @Teslarati @TeslaMotorsClub #Tesla owners. Just an FYI. The Reus Audio stereo upgrade is worth every penny. @elonmusk you should be partnering with these guys for an Ultra Premium factory stereo option. http:// reusaudio.com
We are not as rational as we think. Investors in fossil fuel energy refuse to admit that their investment is a sunk cost and look for new ways to serve the energy market as @Tesla is doing. Eventually fossil fuel tech will be obsolete and they will lose all their investments. Sad

Funny how this only happens when @Tesla begins to threaten their market shares The advent of EV - it's a beautiful thing (and about damn time!)
Flawless victory for @Tesla !! https:// youtu.be/8ye7Vh-_b50 @elonmusk really knows what he's doing!
Did @joerogan ever buy a @Tesla p100d? @elonmusk
Start by embracing Carbon Tax & putting funds to good use, eliminate coal power, investing in carbon capture, increasing Solar & Wind power significantly, and providing NATIONAL rebates for electric vehicles. @liberal_party @Conservatives @NDP @Climeworks @Tesla @CanWEA

@elonmusk when @Tesla is going to launch a electric motorcycle
@tesla when do 2019 model of the s and x come out
Thank you Elon, you make me proud to drive a @Tesla
@elonmusk have you looked at testing battery life on @Tesla Semi with #trailertail and side skirts on the trailers?
Go for it @elonmusk @Tesla rules. Better to act than to ask in an emergency
The Model S 100D isn't the quickest @Tesla , but it sure does go far on a charge: http:// crdrv.co/eoXqCaM pic.twitter.com/wbbEo5qd5q
Hi @elonmusk @Tesla I love my Model S more than anything. It's the perfect car for an active family near the Swiss Alps. But it needs to carry skis for us. The future glass only roof seems to not support roof bars anymore, will there be a solution for us? Thx pic.twitter.com/QyNu3H6VSN
@tesla powerwall ftw
5G will allow @elonmusk and @Tesla to push technology to its limits for communication

@kfury posting publicly can often get companies to provide better service (we exist to make that process easier). @elonmusk @Tesla if youre serious about helping with the fires get in touch with Kevin. It would be super meaningful for their family and would be low cost for you.
True altruism doesn't exist. It cannot exist. Who cares what @elonmusk 's motives are? As long as the people who need help get help, it doesn't matter if @Tesla gets some free (because they need it ) exposure, does it.
Solar power has always been key to the future of automotive how you haven't succeeded in this area with @Tesla @elonmusk is quite shocking tbh.

@elonmusk last week sent my resume in for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Test Operator from http:// tesla.com/careers . Would be an honor & privileged to be on the team putting all my energy & passion for @Tesla mission if I can be of service. Model 3, 47 days, 13,000 miles ;)
@Tesla @elonmusk you guys should send an update out to the model 3 so the second scroll wheel can control the fan like the S. -Tesla employee
@Tesla @elonmusk can u hook me up with a free tesla in 9 months when im 16
@elonmusk @Tesla how about transferable/vehicle based FUSC as an early adopter perk? No refunds necessary and would please all the 3P- and 3P+ buyers alike?
Elon you are doing great @Tesla but what can we do to go faster? I feel like we should be breaking ground on 20 gigafactories right now. If we band together ppl like @JeffBezos @Benioff Larry Elison @BillGates Larry Page Zuck etc, you guys should fund 50% w others matching

The major auto players also have a part to play...stop lobbying for a pace of change that maximises ROI on legacy models. The success of @Tesla has thankfully upset the apple cart.
@elonmusk Can't help seeing the similarities between @Tesla and and Rearden Steel in the movie @AtlasShrugged .
True, but what about its sport/luxury competitors from Germany and Japan? In this competitive, volume-driven, SUV-heavy space, does anyone (other than @Tesla , but for different reasons) still fire up the imagination?
I think @Dyson has just as good a shot as any of the legacy automakers to be successful in the #EV space. Starting with a clean slate certainly didn't hurt @Tesla .
Expected. The future is here. @Tesla
Thank you @Tesla @elonmusk for giving ability to install new updates from app. I don't have wifi at my apartment parking but got a update notification while grocery shopping at wholefoods and finished updating my Model 3 while also free charging during my shopping. Awesome car
EV (PHEV + BEV) sales market share of new vehicle sales in California - Jan-Aug 2018 | Aug = 9.90% | YTD 7.07% | July & Aug show the impact from the @Tesla Model 3 cc: @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/XC2KKZ6MSG
All the evidence points to EV's replacing the ICE, but my guess is the major auto players will continue to lobby for a pace of change that maximises ROI on legacy models. The success of @Tesla has thankfully expedited the rate of change.
Right now I need a really good book, my girlfriend to be with me and @Tesla
@Tesla #gnome pic.twitter.com/mth5ZbNIIm
Makes me equally mad when you show absolutely no care for your customers. I have been going through absolutely horrible experiences trying to get my Model 3. And you already have taken $3500 of my hard earned money. @elonmusk and @Tesla are shameful ...

@Tesla @TeslaMotorsClub @elonmusk how about a factory recall on the Tesla Model S handles breaking. Take some responsibility on this. #unacceptable #poorqualitycontrol
@elonmusk Will @Tesla eventually make a motorcycle or are the plans to stay on 4 or more wheels?
Let me shoot a new video in the latest model.... @Tesla theme song right here ready for you #justakidfromtexastryingtomakeit pic.twitter.com/lPEM3hwiJ9
That's their job ;o) The trouble with EV is range and the fact that 78% of our electrical generation comes from fossil fuels. If I were @Tesla & others I would include a renewable power home instillation with the price of the car. That would help.
Took delivery of my new Dual Motor Model 3. For the 4 miles that I drove it, it was the best car I have ever driven. Great quality and great performance(even without the performance upgrade). Great job @elonmusk and @Tesla pic.twitter.com/db1gUld3b1
Lamborghini urus vs @tesla model X P100d vs mercedes-amg g63 drag race @elonmusk look at this https:// youtu.be/8ye7Vh-_b50
Dear @elonmusk , I'm an American that lives 50% in Sweden & I have to tell you that @Tesla needs a tow hook option on M3 & MS because 60+% of sedans in the EU have one. It's the reason SUVs are not as popular here as in the US. Every family has or rents a small trailer as needed. pic.twitter.com/7TqDfoS67w
I mean I always wanted @Tesla but today I need @Tesla . The air is too bad...got sick :-/

@Tesla I want this Solar Roof soooooo much! @Elon please have a look at my profile and give me a sign, even if it is a "NO" Our roof is prepared to wait for the Tesla Energy Roof
Since @Tesla has their "Bioweapon Defense Mode" does this mean that Madmax will now have Teslas instead of these run down cars?
If only I would have won the mega millions.... I could have bought my @Tesla model 3 and been off work this weekend

@Tesla trucks will come in handy in future disasters. Hauling Powerpacks to create mobile Supercharging stations, to keep all the Model S & X running even when the grid is down.
Had the pleasure of viewing(sitting in) @Tesla car in Milton Keynes; Learning how Teslas new self driving model navigates traffic and road accidents. So dope! #Tesla #future #Elonmuskisbatman

Mam do u drive @Tesla ? Dont you use AC?, And couldn't hear your thoughts on Farmers burning left of Sugercane harvest, who know's they might say burning oil lamp in temples causes air pollution instead use candles! Just curious!
Formula 1 tunes software for every track. @Tesla can bring that capability to weekend pilots.
