@Tesla I decided to add EAP to my order. But my order is most likely going to be delivered this week some time. Can I add it this close to delivery since it's a software key? Can I add it at the old pre-delivery price of $4k since I ordered the vehicle before the price change?

@Tesla or just put red cones on the snow next time to make the traction point clear to all.
The advantage of @Tesla M3 seems to come mostly in the 1st second of the race. Did anyone benchmark the "one-second from 0mph" speed, i.e. how fast a car can run one second after launch from a stand still? In urban driving, that may be a more relevant benchmark than 0-60.
@Tesla Looks like fishtailing. Show yours taking corners in perfect control while bmw etc go out of control. Same w breaking. I get you are showing good traction w zig zag byw.

The problem w/ taking @tesla pvt, would be keeping index funds invested. It's complicated or in cases outright impossible for them to hold pvt shares. That's roughly 19% of the existing fund ownership. Active funds might find it a bit easier.

It will be a great travesty, for the common people if @Tesla goes private. We are trending down a path where the public markets become a place to dump stock on retail investors, and collect capital gains.
I sort of agree with you. But @Tesla is a very influential and powerful company, and Saudi Arabia has been opening and modernizing little by little--especially with their recent change in leadership. Maybe this relationship will help the spread of more beneficial ideas.

http:// owl.li/QKsP30lqhjk Hmm is this @elonmusk @Tesla 420 curve ball or high cheese funded #ChangefortheFuture business model alignment.
Why, why would Tesla deliberately sabotage their own vehicles, that defies logic! What possible benefit can be derived, except share market manipulation, and Elon is offering significantly higher than the asking price, so it has to be malicious actions against @Tesla
I told you all that @elonmusk was in deep shit when he tweeted the other day. There is Zero Chance the US SEC will let him off now. Deep doodoo. @Tesla the biginning of the end! Sadly. Loose lips. But he did change the world. He is going to prison. Elon - remember me! Ha!

This morning on @SquawkAlley , @plibin weighed in on Elon Musk's "breakdown" and what its implications are for @Tesla : https:// buff.ly/2Bgaffz
I Love my car. it is so much fun to drive Worth every penny and I never spent more than $25K on a car before. Tnx @Tesla is costing me $130 more than my Prius with gas savings pic.twitter.com/eQaOzLaI3F
I love @elonmusk . He's brilliant - I can't even imagine how he is dealing with the stress of these 3 businesses @Tesla @boringcompany @SpaceX . We need to get him a #2 on all 3 businesses, so the man can take a week long vacation. Let's help! Best candidates? #ElonMusk
For @elonmusk , I listened to @edyson recommend to entrepreneurs that they hire a CEO. Creative hard work @Tesla seems done, leave scaling and efficiency for someone with a passion for manufacturing, operations, logistics, etc ... investors own their allocation risk. Be well - MV
@elonmusk Mr. Musk, you did the right thing. Take care of yourself, health and your well being. So, you can build on your vision of a better world and better environment for all of us. You are an amazing human being. $ TSLA @Tesla
@elonmusk get some rest. The world will wait. Take care of yourself first. @Tesla @AZEALIASPEAKS
@elonmusk Mr. Musk, I admire your courage, honesty and your vision. Life is filled with ups and downs. It's also filled with disappointments. This too shall pass. I believe in your leadership and your vision. Keep going. $ TSLA $ TSLAQ @Tesla
Having the shorts and negative media, Maybe its time not only @saudiarabia but also #apple #google #amazon etc to support @Tesla @elonmusk .
I am a teacher - definitely not a millionaire, unlike @fordnation (who was born rich btw). The unfair exclusion of @Tesla directly impacted my family and families like me. Mr Ford promised to include all cars in the rebate wind-down. Promise made, promise broken pic.twitter.com/tIhlPYXVY3
Hydroplaned and spun out at 70mph this morning. Left the road and almost went into oncoming traffic. Miraculously didn't hit anything. Zero permanent damage to my car, obviously not a scratch on me either. Thanking my guardian angels and @tesla a whole lot right now. pic.twitter.com/OAQdH9M7Tp
@elonmusk according to the article in the @nytimes , ELON.... you are the LEADER of a new peoples movement called @Tesla ,a kite only flies high against the wind. So keep healthy and keep fighting. We fight for you, we love you, we need you and we thank you for your hard work.
@elonmusk @Tesla how many packs of gummy worms will it take for me to get a Tesla Roadster. Asking for a friend.
Pure American #S3Xy I love it when this randomly happens. @Model3Owners @lexiheft @Tesla @seanmmitchell pic.twitter.com/FnGEj3JDSl
@elonmusk @Tesla buy @bollingermotors
Re: $25K @Tesla : for me whenever I watch @elonmusk answer a question and he has to stare into the air, do some calculations in his head then say 'umm, ~maybe~ around...' is when I wish he would just give a canned response like "Once we get our other priorities in check"
They just need batteries to aborb the excesses and release it later @tesla @elonmusk @gerberKawasaki @StateStreet
Apple to initiate an hostile takeover on @tesla on Monday according to people familiar with the matter. $ tsla
I wish @elonmusk hadn't given a timeline (3 yrs) re: a $25K @Tesla . Let @Tesla get #Model3 production stabilized, bring #ModelY , the truck, the semi and the roadster to market + #Powerwalls , #solar , new factories. A higher volume lower profit car is the last thing they need.

I finally got to see the new @Tesla Model 3 up close...it's a very beautiful car! pic.twitter.com/1Galh6U0wd
@Tesla : everyone talks about Americans made car and auto industry and then same guys short tesla stock. Such an irony.
Oh well big ocean, ... Want a boat tbh. Must be calm. @Tesla what about electric boats ?
Obv you have no idea how Henry @Ford treated his employees. It's a disgrace to @Tesla 's @elonmusk to have you compare him to tyrant & elitist @Ford . #knowyourhistory
My car escaped a wobbling semi today. Thanks to @Tesla , and @elonmusk
I do adore my @Tesla model S with two exceptions. The seats are uncomfortable compared to even average "luxury" cars and the a/c is poor at cooling for all passengers, esp in Cali heat Wife & kids not happy @elonmusk
Dear Mr @elonmusk please review the UK wiper speeds. I understand that in the US you get rain.. but here in the UK we GET rain. 75% of the year(if not more). Variable speed & Velocity. Pls review as a matter of urgency & safety @Tesla @Teslatunity @TheTeslaLife @TeslaMotorsClub
Pip going for a ride in the new Model 3. Thanks @Tesla @elonmusk !! pic.twitter.com/mv4XTc7DNh
Installed and charging. Love the finish on these. Thanks team @Tesla !! pic.twitter.com/8CrXlFYm5L
According to the Bloomberg tracker, @tesla is now consistently producing over 5,000 Model 3's per week. Likely on track to produce around 50,000 Model 3 in Q3. @tesla will be selling more because they had many in transit in Q2. Looks like no immediate need for cash.

@elonmusk not a @Tesla #flaminteslas
Spending a little time on iTunes buying @thirdmanrecords music and creating Spotify/Slacker channels this morning in appreciation for the free concert for @Tesla employees.
Is the @Tesla board interested in adding a Dallas-Fort Worth based exec to support @elonmusk ? I know a guy with some off the wall #EV and #Renewables ideas.
Thanks! I came past it while they were removing it. Not sure what happened but that @Tesla is gonna need a bandaid.
@TheTweetOfGod hows your cash position? If good, pls consider helping @elonmusk take @Tesla private. And smite the short sellers.
i have no use for a @Tesla semi but i want one so bad
@Tesla ?
@Tesla for an audience pic.twitter.com/WMcDRDYi8J
Sure grandma Louise his life is a vacation. What do you think he does @Tesla ? Party or vacation. @elonmusk
Probably not as much as Elon will have to use if he wants to get the Saudis to fund his @Tesla buyout.
Attention #ev drivers. Great service from @StenaLineUK @StenaLine today. Not only do they have a charge point on board, they also called me back to the car because they were concerned it had stopped and didn't want me to be caught short @FullyChargedShw @Tesla @EVNewsDaily pic.twitter.com/vUqNylIwWi
Yerrr @elonmusk They call me The Lord I have a solution for you & @Tesla DM me
There is a market for after-market @Tesla parts, esp Model 3 bumpers

I need to re make my list of things to get before 30. And add all @Tesla s products. @MKBHD & @elonmusk are so inspirational.
@elonmusk @Tesla M3 owner here since May. Cruise control, EAP, and auto wipers haven't worked in over a week. Service isn't proactively communicating status and I keep having to call in to 30-60 min hold times. No idea when it will be fixed. Very frustrated. Help?
@Tesla @TeslaSupport I'm buying a 2015, 2016 or 2017 used Tesla Model S. How do I determine if the previous owner purchased the advanced auto pilot feature?

@Tesla when is the new apparel coming to the Tesla shop?
Pow @tesla 136k, plowing some miles. My super space car is back.
@Tesla @elonmusk you should consider to conceal the back seat latch to prevent this kind of break in and theft on model S pic.twitter.com/j9KaqslrmB
@Tesla as a shareholder, please have Elon take a forced 3-week vacation at a minimum. When he returns, two hours less a day.

Hey @Purdue this makes life difficult for EV owners. Any ETA on a repair? How about reaching out to @tesla for something a bit more modern. pic.twitter.com/Dwo0jg2mYE
What was @tesla saying earlier about Innovation in their industry?
@Tesla @elonmusk Are you planning to build more superchargers in Czechia? The is so little chargers in here, it is almost impossible to charge conviniently, without charging at home, and for a lot of people that is not an option.
@Tesla #ModelS is a great drive. Superb. Filled with tech. Tried auto-pilot and self-parking. Definitely something I can get used to. #ThatAccelerationThough
Would love to see Tesla on Indian roads, Any plans of tesla to come in Indian market? @elonmusk @Tesla

The Symbols are too powerful for @tesla
Edison, Ford, Bell, Whitney, Colt et al did not have much media social or otherwise as a distraction.... Most interesting point was option for Saudi Arabia (think @OPEC ) as owner of @Tesla (electric car with no need for gas)..... https:// lnkd.in/gWnDXbq
