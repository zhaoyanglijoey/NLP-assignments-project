@Tesla @elonmusk why Tesla's Delivery advisors keep pushing the date just because their final contract is not ready. It was rescheduled last week, today I got a call again and they told me that they won't be able to do it on coming Thursday again. Isn't this rubbish !!
Just found out that 15 days after I got laid off in a mass of employee cutbacks, @tesla cancelled my health benefits. I wonder how many others they did this to. Could this be how they are going to turn a profit?

@Tesla @elonmusk will you merge with ride-share companies for ultimate sustainability, and to keep driver standard of living & living wages high, consumers happy?

@Tesla 's execution has improved over time, and it will continue to do so. I am long $ TSLA , and I prefer @elonmusk to continue to personally be involved in advancing manufacturing to beyond industry norms, but the choice is up to him.
Here is how I read that: @Tesla is not for everyone, like @NavySealsTeam6 is not for everyone. I mean, just look at the Autopilot team yesterday on the CC. 2nd rate folks go to Apple or BMW etc. Best engineers want to work at @Tesla & @SpaceX
But @Tesla new chip is still thousands X faster, making their own chip lower the cost and make it proprietary. @elonmusk is just applying what he did on @SpaceX , if they can make it their own to lower the cost and improved it significantly without relying to someone, they will.

Final msg on @tesla - The only thing that has been a positive so far has been the ppl at the Service Center (Palo Alto) who are clearly trying to keep their heads above water and were incredibly gracious in handling the issues (and apologetic for something they had no fault in).
I ordered mine because my three friends who own Teslas have had years of problem-free enjoyment. A Tesla is to current ICE cars as the iPhone was to 2007 Nokias. The world is changing. @Tesla @elonmusk
Analysts are focused on how many @tesla Model 3's are getting shipped. They should be looking into how many get dropped off at a Service Center w/n 30 days (or 1 day) of delivery.
@Tesla How can I confirm with someone at sales if my AWD Perf order for the Model 3 qualifies for unlimited supercharging? Thanks!
Will write up a post about @tesla experience soon but suffice to say it sucked. I think they are rushing Model 3's out without really caring about QA and letting the service centers deal with the fall out. Can get sales on the phone in 10 seconds. Service? 10 minutes avg. so far

Hey @elonmusk @Tesla , any ETA on first batch of Obsidian AWD Model 3s?
. @Tesla Surfboard accelerates down the line Elon Musk teamed up with Matt Biolos' @lostsurfboards to develop a $1,500 board that fits inside and outside the Model S, X and 3 electric cars. http:// goo.gl/idghKQ via @surfertoday pic.twitter.com/3dx1RjgHlu
Could put your name on the @Tesla list - the Model 3 AWD are supposed to be scary fast with the dual motors.
AlsoFUCK EBRO AND ROSENBERG UNTILI GETMY BLUE CHECK @Rosenbergradio @oldmanebro ARE NOT VERIFIED TO ME @Twitter @TwitterSports @TwitterSupport WHAT DID THEY DO BUT BE RICH AND OLD WHEN TWITTER CAME OUT I WENT THREW LIFE @elonmusk @Tesla @kendricklamar #Morethenanathlete @garyvee

Too bad as while this experience has sucked, I see @tesla as a shining example of what is possible with technology and vision. The world needs more ppl like @elonmusk , and he apparently needs some really solid ops ppl.
I was excited to pick up my #teslamodel3 this Tuesday. Until it was rescheduled for the 4th time just right now. I expected better @Tesla
PS @Tesla I STOPPED EATING MEAT FOR A TIME CAPITAL LETTERS AIN'T SHIT @elonmusk I ALSO WILL BE SWEATING UNTIL I GET MY COCK SUCKING BLUE CHECK.
Expanding after-sales facilities in already-reached markets is investment that would prove its worth. @Tesla
ILL STOP TALKING IN KAPITAL LETTERS WHEN @Twitter @TwitterSports @TwitterSupport FINALLY GIVES ME MY DAMN BLUE CHECK #LETTERPROTESTTWITTER I ALSO WILL STOP TAGGING @elonmusk N @Tesla EVERYDAY WHEN I GET MY BLUE CHECK.
How long until @tesla vehicles deliver themselves to their new customers? https:// qz.com/1343907/ via @qz
@elonmusk @Tesla figure out stop signs
@Tesla @elonmusk 2 weeks +5 days without my Model S. My neighbor just asked me if I traded in my car. #TeslaPurgatory pic.twitter.com/QtvDD2coqZ
They really shouldn't let @Tesla owners drive normal cars. Got in my rental and it really took a minute to remember how to drive.
@tesla you must be kicking ass omg Tesla's everywhere. Hi white model 3 and silver model s that waved.

@Tesla adding Atari games to the in-car display with their next software update could be pretty cool. From @verge : https:// bit.ly/2n4oHxj pic.twitter.com/hfIfgk5JAr
I have forgiven @tesla For making a car that greatly exceeded my expectations.
@Tesla @elonmusk Hey Elon, I think you should allow customers to get pre-approved before ordering to avoid any financing mishaps at the time of delivery.
Hi @Tesla and @SolarCity . Tina here in Samoa. Do the power outages today have anything to do with our new battery storage system? It's disrupting this musical thing I do every Sunday. Phone is at 3 % https:// youtu.be/v6ojnuHuTa8

Can I test drive your car without a license? @elonmusk @Tesla
@elonmusk Elon, Any chance in hell @Tesla will make an insanely fast jet ski?!!!!!?
Look what we got today after 857 days of waiting! I absolutely love this car! I've never driven anything like it... Let alone owned something comparable. I know it's cheesy but I feel like the future is finally here! Thank You @elonmusk and @Tesla ! pic.twitter.com/BaVGxRV4wm

Just gave my first @tesla #Model3 test ride/drive. I may have been a little too verbose (sorry @kirkzieser ), but if anyone else in the area wants one, hit me up.
It's clear that makers of electric cars like @Tesla have growing concerns of customers to effectively address. Much investment is needed recruiting and training more after-sales teams in regions/markets they're penetrating. @elonmusk
I'm pretty sure that acievement will be unlocked with the requisite 51 @Tesla miles and smiles. pic.twitter.com/355fATR0pt

Started our three week long cross country trip from VA to WA (and back) today in our @Tesla #Model3 . Would love to have a timer feature that logs how much time the car engaged Autopilot during each leg. What do you think, @elonmusk ?
If I could afford a @Tesla I would go all out! Roof shingles, battery and of course a ride. #IfICould

Sick man you are Mark. Instead of looking at the wheel Mark, pay some attention to this tragic. Tesla Has nothing to do with the accident. You are so desperate Mark, losing all your investors money buying short on @Tesla . You are just not smart. Stock went up +16% go tesla
@potus I want a @Tesla model X in black. Make that happen bruh

Hey @elonmusk , how about @tesla streamline manufacturing and only produce the M3P, but lock the premium features - dual motors, performance features, LR battery, etc., for later in-app purchases? Maybe margins can't take it right now, but would be an idea for the future... $ TSLA

@Tesla hi please make a car to replicate this design I made when I was 10 thanks pic.twitter.com/62VSmitHl6
Hey @elonmusk Why not put piezoelectric plates on @Tesla s to give extra range?
any thought that the batteries in the model 3 @Tesla have a better ability to maintain range? Not that these numbers are bad at all! Just curious from minds that know better than I.
Hey @Tesla I have prototype submission of a game to be played with the Tesla touchpad. It can be integrated with the Enhanced Autopilot to change how the A.I. reacts. :^) You can play it online here: http:// newfastuff.com/the-tesla-game/

Worth it pic.twitter.com/LJB1LKQzyM
@tesla @elonmusk Yesterday I encountered a difficult situation with flooded roads due to an extreme storm. I wonder how Teslas handle that kind of situation. Thinking that battery is low in the floor, don't know the height you put the motors e.t.c
