I don't think bears have understood $ TSLA if they think this company's valuation is only based on it being a mass market car company. No, It's valuation is based more on the future it promises and trust in @elonmusk and @Tesla team to help deliver it! pic.twitter.com/AkaGYRzSgy

4/ Lastly, with regard to the bird droppings, @Tesla can't control avian bathroom habits, and there likely isn't space to store the cars indoors, since the dealerships tend to have relatively limited square footage. $ tsla #model3
@Tesla requests price reductions from suppliers to improve its bottom line @WSJ
3/ Orange peel is common even on high end cars, and doesn't look bad at all in these photos. Most @Ferrari 's I've seen have some amount of orange peel, I've seen @Maserati_HQ ' with orange peel, etc. $ tsla @Tesla #model3
2/ The gap between the windows isn't more severe than the panel gaps on many high end cars. $ tsla @Tesla #model3
Most likely the short selling on @Tesla is being financed by the companies that stand to be hurt. They can afford to lose the money they are shorting if they can stop or at least delay @Tesla . If they lose this gamble they stand to lose an increasing share of the market to @Tesla
1/ These are likely cars that just haven't been officially delivered to customers yet. There are very large numbers of orders being filled, and they have to store those vehicles somewhere. $ tsla @Tesla #model3

Do @CNNMoney @MSNBC and now @FoxBusiness think the ordinary investor is stupid with their factless coverage about #Model3 cancellations? Even if only 50% reservations convert to orders, @Tesla would still have 7+ billion dollars in it's revenue pipeline from #Model3 alone. $ TSLA

Epic @Tesla road trip coming up @elonmusk . My best friend from Australia and his 2 boys are flying to Vancouver today to help us drive our S & X from Victoria, BC to Charlottesville, VA for our move! 9 days, ~29,543km by air, 5,168km by Tesla, lifetime of memories. :) pic.twitter.com/cOrdG0obHY

The @ONtransport and @fordnation are not including the phase out of ehvip to manufactures that don't operate on a dealership mode in order to mitigate impacts to dealerships. What about mitigating impacts to consumers? #playfair #ev #ontario @Tesla @Model3Owners
Yes, yes but how does it match up against a top spec @Tesla ?
@elonmusk I was just told by a rep @tesla that the PowerWall that I ordered (and paid in full for) in April probably wouldn't be available until 2019. I was told there'd be a delay of a few months due to helping Puerto Rico. I'm fine with that. But a delay of almost a year? Wtf
@Tesla should make shipping containers with embedded #solar panels on top. Think of all the shipping containers sitting in the sun. #MAGA with #RenewableEnergy

You can make a mountain out of a mole hill if you massage numbers and make some pretty plots. This analysis is meaningless since number of @Tesla cars is only a small fraction of the luxury car stock. A sufficiently large population is the first requisite of such analysis.

"Even @Tesla , which offers the largest batteries/range in a premium personal use product, has not found the road to on-going profitability as of yet" Profitability is a codger metric for a high growth segment Dinosaur thinking here - don't waste your time reading this nonsense.

@CNN @tesla "The wait time for a Model 3 is about 4 months to a year, and base model customers could wait until 2020." So, the responder the other day to my post saying Tesla is essentially defrauding those who put down their money now looks even snarkier than he did originally.

Let's say 400K (250K US/35K CA/115K rest) put down $1K. @tesla opened up higher margin #model3 to US/CA due to large tax rebates. @elonmusk wants some of the 285K (+ new folks) to get a higher-end car. Reservation holders will be first in line for base model once it's available.
@CostaMesaPD Is there not a law about a company using the city street to store vehicles TESLA using 150 Klamus and Pullman to park thier vehs and we have no place to park where we work @CityofCostaMesa up to 10 cars at times Very Rude Tesla @Tesla pic.twitter.com/YVHjiB34hA
@elonmusk when will @Tesla and/or @SpaceX start making rovers for Mars? We'll need transportation there too
Say what you will about @elonmusk and @Tesla fundamentally atrocious financials and #tulipmania like stock valuation...I was driving the 5 freeway in SoCal this morning surrounded by 7.. count it 7.. independently owned Tesla's scattered within eye shot heading North. Impressive.
My top bucket list item. Many people want a Roleee, chains, cars, or whatever... I want to retire in my 50's and own a lil helicopter. Not a big one, I'm not greedy. Plus, by then @elonmusk should be giving us affordable flying @Tesla so we'll see.

Great job @Tesla on your "book service appointment online" UX. It's the little things -- and you nailed it.

Picked up my Model 3 yesterday. Loving it! THANK YOU to everyone at @Tesla , especially the factory folks. Your tremendous efforts are greatly appreciated by your customers.
@elonmusk @Tesla I have mode 3, the car is nice, but couple of things needs to be done to reduce noise on bumpy roads: 1)the metal tool in the front trunk needs a rubber or foam bed , 2)the plastic cover above front wheels needs to be firm to stop shacking #Tesla #ElonMusk
I am having nightmare with getting a flaking paint repair done under warranty. A total shambles. It has taken ages and now they are saying I can either have loner and they won't pick the car up or they will pick the car up and I can't have a loner. @Tesla it's under warranty.
Texas breweries are fighting for the right to sell direct to consumer. @Tesla is fighting for the right to sell direct in Texas. I feel like @elonmusk & @brockwagner could build a partnership to change the future of Texas. And hey, @SaintArnold is minutes away from @NASA_Johnson
One of the coolest experiences of my entire life - test driving a #Tesla in Palm Desert. Ludicrous mode is out of this world. Thanks @Tesla pic.twitter.com/2IHkIJIrEV
@elonmusk and @Tesla if @Jeep can have a jeepwave; Tesla could have a wink feature. Allow for a stalk pull or button push for one of the headlights to wink; love my M3 and find myself waving at other Tesla owners. Mixed results on the wave back . This could change that
Anyone recommend how to remove the aero rims? @Model3Owners @Teslatunity @tesla
Was on the fence about my @Tesla Model 3 reservation. Just drove a Performance AWD version. No longer a doubter, and no longer on the fence. Agressive acceleration, tight handling, smooth ride. Bit of control change from my S ( display and autopilot ) but no big deal.
The first deliveries of @Tesla #Model3 happened one year ago today at the delivery event in Fremont. Now Tesla has made close to 80,000 of these cars.
@Tesla my name is Christian and the All American Chelsea Podcast is my own show. My question is who the hell is Ian Hunter, why is his name and face on my podcast. As a matter of fact let me speak to Elon so we can get this fixed. #Tesla pic.twitter.com/4kJHEPCcHL
@tesla Can I use my Solar Referral Credit ($750) when purchasing my Model 3?
Month 2 with our @Tesla Model S and we love it more than ever. We keep finding excuses to drive more and further. This is one amazing car! Thank you @elonmusk for doing it right!
This is @KristaKoscik 's face after we placed her @tesla Model 3 order! Still in shock we actually did it pic.twitter.com/S3y5LjdvXA
@teslanomicsco @Tesla noticed clients picking up their performance model 3s without badging and the spoiler, what is going on?
@elonmusk Can the new @Tesla Solar roof tiles hold up to being on a mobile tiny house?
When is the $35K @Tesla #Model3 coming @elonmusk , my patience is running out.
Thanks @Tesla for the new Owen Sound Supercharger! The Bruce beckons! pic.twitter.com/1cUv5gPIzN
@elonmusk @Tesla I have an idea for the company and charging stations ! I don't know how to move forward to share, thought this would be best. DM if interstellar ?
Companies like @Tesla , @facebook , @Google accept our cryptocurrency, please. As a means of trade. pic.twitter.com/KGXG6MesKT
@elonmusk If there's an incontrovertible way to do " @Pravduh ", then it must be done soon (or we're all drowning in ignorance generated by baseless/fraudulent FUD).To say nothing of losing #OccupyMars as a way for humans to move forward. Godspeed @SpaceX , @Tesla , @GwynneShotwell .
Hey they make @tesla Model K(ids) pic.twitter.com/B7EOAHJces
Okay, so the @Tesla store has all sorts of shirts, caps, bags, phone chargers ... and now even has surfboards. But wtf, no shorts? Why the HELL can't I proudly display my TSLA shorts!!?
There's NOTHING I despise MORE than dealerships and the incredible pressure when I would go to one. Always dreading it. The two @tesla dealerships I've visited (and purchased a MX from the Santa Monica one after many visits) were amazing. I get it why @elonmusk laughed at this
@elonmusk @Tesla Ding-proof doors. Think about it. #FeatureRequest
Saving for college? Owning a home in the future? Nope! #ownthesave #sweepstakes #tesla @Tesla pic.twitter.com/JcBml7rBkn
A residential #storage program using @Tesla Powerwall batteries that @GreenMtnPower rolled out to its #VT customers saved $500,000 by reducing peak demand during a July heat wave http:// bit.ly/2mIhbYx pic.twitter.com/77VWuPbzTe
Autopilot is so underestimated, unfortunately due to FUD articles published by "journalists" and negativity pushed by $ TSLA shorts. Autopilot improves safety, and I wish every car on the road had it today. I hope that safety stats soon to be released by @Tesla ends the nonsense.

My favorite part of the @HandmaidsOnHulu season finale was the @Tesla @elonmusk .

Checking out the Model X and model 3 @tesla . These are sweet rides.
@tesla 's real world, functioning & available now autopilot is more robust than any other car companies' autonomous driving system; easy to test drive and see the difference. Owner satisfaction-best in industry. Sales higher each 1/4-beating other luxury brands. Superchargers.....
