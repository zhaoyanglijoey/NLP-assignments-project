So many @Tesla in Cali. I love the new model 3.
When your phone stops working as your @Tesla Key: - delete your phone as a key - delete bt paring from phone - delete app - reboot phone - reinstall app - try to set phone as a key: IF this fails, repeat up to 37 times - thank @elonmusk musk for producing such an amazing car
Could @Tesla do an ebike? I'd buy one in an instant.
hey @elonmusk - would love to get the 3, but living in a Victorian single front house (with no garage) proves extremely difficult to charge a car. Hoping @Tesla have some thoughts on this in the future.

What's even more amazing is that the light from the headlights of a @Tesla Roadster 2 still won't arrive any faster.
@elonmusk My friend, about the integration of games into the @Tesla it would be wonderful to have a route simulation game where you can practice driving in different places around the world using @googlemaps
@woodhaus2 @Tesla should initiate a "Crushed Ice" program. Every new Tesla owner that can prove they had there previous ice vehicle crushed will get one month of supercharging for free.
Took delivery of my @Tesla Performance Model 3 last week posing next to my Model S 70. @elonmusk really hit it out of the park, performance is insane and it handles like it is on rails. @Telsa has by far been the best, most fun, worry free cars I have ever own. pic.twitter.com/83y8lWVPey
you lost me. they MUST! they're #GREEN certainly they won't let salvageable vehicles just rot on earth. i wonder if the doc about Rich will inspire a multi-part story of the waste, the risk of trying to salvage them without manuals or support from @tesla
@elonmusk @Tesla When will screens fade to nightmode driving into tunnels? Passed close to 50 tunnels on one trip, and the white main screen is really bad for night vision
@elonmusk @Tesla Could the rear camera be used for opening the trunk on TMX? Keyfob near and foot swipe (or something else?) = trunk open?
@elonmusk @Tesla Setting needed to choose lights off/park/no change when park is selected on gear handle. Return to previous setting (auto/on) when drive/reverse is selected.
@elonmusk @Tesla Navi often freaks out on ferrys, guess this is because it looses GPS-signal and does not recalibrate when signal is back. Any chance of a fix?
Hey @elonmusk When does the @Tesla pickup truck get released? And, can I put my name on the pre-order list? I have lots of questions on solar roofs, and battery packs also.
@elonmusk @Tesla wish one of these where mine. #Tesla pic.twitter.com/kEjV7tgIvo
Best thing about electric cars is how quiet they are - whole new driving experience - peaceful & calm. Can't wait for @Tesla @elonmusk to bring that level of quiet to the water when they begin making electric boats!! (after they conquer Mars & hylerloop across the USA)
@elonmusk the thing keeping your stock from going down IS short covering! @Tesla huge cash burn, net debt surging, NWC drained, CapEx bizarrely slashed as you plan to build a factories in China & Europe, conflicting reports over production and demand, revenue unexpec. recasted...

Impressed with @Porsche 's '19 and '20 range of electric and hybrid autos. Interested to see how @tesla will compete.
do you have a link to info about how they are doing that ? i'm knew to @Tesla at that level of detail just heard about the salvage thing from that doc
@SierraClub Hi there ! Question: Is @Tesla @elonmusk #GreenWashing because of their PR and "mission" while not allowing 3rd parties to salvage wrecked vehicles ? @motherboard has a fascinating short doc out about #RichRebuilds
The critics in this thread are stating things that anyone who has experienced an actual @Tesla know better about. #sad

@Tesla @elonmusk Look at Audi Electric Motors Production https:// youtu.be/zttC2x9nMEw via @YouTube . Can you explain why the manufacturing is so slow and the motors are so big in comparison to the slim and high integrated Tesla motors?

@elonmusk I just got a used '14 MS60, I didn't know until after I bought it that supercharging was a $2500 option at the time of configure. Previous owner didn't tell me they didn't have SC, so now I have a Tesla with zero access to the @Tesla supercharging network. Please help!
A viable path to CF positive Q3 for @Tesla - I know our favorite charter ( @TeslaCharts ) and the rest of the #teslaq crowd disagrees. I am among the short but think Q3 will actually deliver 1.3M in margins. @TezzlaCFO and @elonmusk have this dialed in. pic.twitter.com/bvw4g2Q6I6

The moderator failed to know the difference between revenue and income. The kid talked over @markbspiegel most of the time, which she never stopped. Hmm. Debt is paid off with FCF (operating CF - capex), not the operating CF that @elonmusk claims sufficient. @Tesla has none.
The impact of EVs is not negligible, but often overstated. If every US mile driven were with an EV with efficiency slightly less than that of a @tesla #model3 , then you would add 19% (805TWh) to 2016 total supply of 4,150TWh. 1/2

I love what @elonmusk and @Tesla did today. He just finessed everybody that doubts their innovation. The brand is strong af! Keep innovating, soul brother!
Your world is software, emphasis on SOFT. Your tone highlights your unfamiliarity w/ laws. You hold compliance licenses? Not every @Tesla critic is short $ TSLA . Your beloved savior violated Sarbanes-Oxley & various disclosure laws. Lastly, Dorothy Hamill wants her hair back.

Haha, thought that was a mechanical utter at first. Always amazed by @Tesla #designthinking
@elonmusk is it possible that once you get the @Tesla shanghai gigafactory built and running that you may look at listing on the shanghai stock exchange?
@elonmusk @Tesla It would be cool if Tesla was unlike the rest of the industry while waiting on hold for your reps, i.e. giving the choice to wait on hold in silence/not hear repeating marketing messages, or a call back when a rep is ready to talk.
Not every Tesla share holder is a Tesla fun. There are people who just make money on @Tesla and they don't care. Not everybody admires Elon so much as many of us do (I do). I do not believe there is 85%. However, I easily can believe this number is over 50%.

The easiest way to think about @Tesla 's future is to ask whether one want to have ICE car or electric Tesla for the same money. The answer is obvious. Hence, any bad mouth people are just interested in shorting.
#Tesla @Tesla @elonmusk
Invest your reserves in @Tesla ?
Would someone @tesla help the lady please? You guys need to go on hiring dedicated people as it looks you have mostly done so fare!
@Tesla is the future.
Curious what you dislike about @Tesla and it's goals as the first luxury #EV auto company?
@Tesla Why would somebody invest 35 billion dollars to buy a chunk of #Tesla when for 35 billion dollars they could build their own. Car company from scratch @elonmusk
Like I stated in another tweet, he needs to get money from somewhere. While the western world is just complaining about @Tesla and @elonmusk , fucking Saudi Arabia is actually investing in them. At least he'll put that dirty blood oil money to some good use.
20b to buy out the small investors is completely doable. Its going to happen. @Tesla and the world will both be better off!

@Tesla gets 100 mpge HWay. My seaplane without wings could get 300 mpg Hway. Old Buick gets 30 mpg. 300 / 30 = 10 to 1. Gasoline = 2.75/gal (no road tax) Electricity = $4/gal (elec) + $4/gal (bat) + $4/gal (super charge) = $12/gal 300/100 x 12/1 = 36. 36 x more for Tesla
When someone bets against @elonmusk You obviously don't know what it was like the first few years @Tesla was getting up and running.
This will be interesting to follow . . . Are they shorting again ? @Tesla @SEC_News
Should you call @Tesla or @elonmusk
Its actually pretty brilliant if it goes through, there's no reason for @Tesla to remain public if there is enough capital available to them from 3rd party investors
@elonmusk if you don't want to deal with investment bankers, I'm happy to help out with the @Tesla take private. Would not require cash deal fees, just stock in the private company as compensation. Lmk

Hey @elonmusk congratulations on another business milestone achieved! I guess @Tesla is 'on its way to orbit' now
@elonmusk following your proposal to take Tesla private, I'm willing to invest my absolute last 15$ in your company. Wall Street may hate you, but the public still trusts @Tesla . Show us you have the guts to create the future and take Tesla private. This is a sign of good will.
I hope @tesla does go private. I'm sick of the attacks in the media from people with short positions distracting from the products they are making.

Yes it's a main feature, yes the cars aren't cheap, but they aren't cheap to make either. Think of it this way, if you don't use Autopilot you get a $5000 or whatever it is discount. @Tesla is giving people the option to get the car cheaper.

I've never bought stock or shares of a company before, but now I want to buy @Tesla I asked @elonmusk this morning how to do it, but he didn't respond (why would he?). So I've been googling around to try to figure it out. Here's some info: https://www. wikihow.com/Buy-Stocks
@Tesla Any 14 days free trial of autopilot for those who haven't purchased with Model X or S?
@Tesla stock is now hovering around $350 a share down from this morning's $420 a share. Thanks @elonmusk

I'd love @Tesla to do a small car. Very efficient, commuter range, the car sharing car, the one for anyone (esp markets like urban EU, India etc) Like the current smart forfour, Renault twingo, Opel Adam, etc
@elonmusk probably going to jail due to SEC violations claiming that he has secured funding to take @Tesla stock private at $420

I think @elonmusk is fighting time really, with @tesla . He is asking investors to trust him, and be patient, but the issue is, no one knows if the risks are worth taking. It could end up being the most brilliant company in history, or go up in smoke.
@DMC_Ryan Hey Ryan. I was wondering if you might have any advice for how to get new emblems for Model 3. I am planning a stealth wrap upon delivery and need them for the detailer,. Since I'm in New Mexico, @Tesla has no presence here. I've tried emailing them and got nowhere.
I think if @tesla had managed growth slower/better, they would have a much better cash position, but it would have come at the expense of growing much slower. Expanding reasonably quickly needs capital. A start up that doesn't produce software taking on incumbents is a tall order

A @Tesla was tailgating me today and for a brief moment I had the thought to test out its automatic braking system.

Thank you @elonmusk and all of the @Tesla employees for re-imagining what a car can be. #Model3 pic.twitter.com/i9EUCiOdpx
. @elonmusk @Tesla @TeslaMotorsClub we were excited to pick up our new model 3 today and this is what was given to us. Waited 2 plus years for this moment...Now we are going home without a car, not even a loaner was provided. pic.twitter.com/DFNVpzwtl1
So you own Tesla stock? Sell it, and put a stake in something that will be stable for the next 20 years. TSLA has yet to face the serious challenges of meeting their shareholder promises. @elonmusk @Tesla
The only spot I ever need to park at a gas station anymore. #SnacksForTheRoad #ScrewBigOil #Model3 @Tesla @DMC_Ryan @elonmusk

Got my official @Tesla #Model3 delivery date! 13 days and counting! pic.twitter.com/4mUgEJq8nr
I see a good game with a @Tesla flying.
@Tesla @elonmusk When can the world expect a motorcycle to disrupt the industry?
I think Mitchell should sue @elonmusk and @tesla
@Tesla Love the glass roof in my Model 3! Newark airport final approach goes right over I95. pic.twitter.com/n3gZU9xYdg
I thought my biggest problem was getting Stanley they #greyhound into the car. He was not happy with the i3. Doing the @Tesla next week.
@chigrl some really hot wings - crushed pineapple, chili sauce, brown sugar, habanero pepper and whiskey - on fire like a @Tesla pic.twitter.com/h5SzlTrq7K
@Tesla Having completed 1500 miles of a 2400 mile round trip from NC to northern Maine I can tell you that without the super charger network an electric car is not very useful, just like a gas car without gas stations! I would not buy a car without a charging network!!
Here's what @Timothy_Lutts thinks about Elon Musk taking $ TSLA private. What do you think? https:// chc.li/2MAtLo9 #investing @Tesla
@ElliotKayeCPSC @Tesla @elonmusk your giving customers a false sense of safety with a name like "autopilot". This name should be banned. It's getting people killed. Maybe some court suit soon who knows
The class you mean? Without reverting to reference material I remembered that the #battleship concept had fantastic longevity, with #USSNewJersey being resurrected for the #GulfWar almost a generation after being mothballed. Probably inadequate as consolation for @Tesla though
As a recent convert to House of @Tesla I'm deeply hurt @elonmusk hasn't shown up with my car yet :( pic.twitter.com/eKOdm2eIZS
It was awesome to visit @Tesla store in NY meatpacking 'start-up' district; a sales executive says like China, India must have its very own Tesla experience soon @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/CC8S5wbNhm
This farcical @Tesla phantom take-over is just Unicorn . Meanwhile, Ross and that inexperienced kid Galileo (who keeps getting undeserved praise) run interference for @elonmusk . pic.twitter.com/jFi7GC7abF
Not a single #Supercharger in Marin? surprised with all of the @Tesla love in the Bay Area that we still have 0 superchargers in SF and 0 in Marin...:/
@Tesla @elonmusk Haha, sued by a rich fucker that wants the company to stay public to.steal tax funds. Sounds like the normal billionaire today. So, if Tesla went Private, how many partners would there be? I think you first must pay investors on a shares buyout.
This also affects @Tesla & @elonmusk
Unless his answer can be "An Affirmation for Elon" (just like "Flowers for Algernon"), @GerberKawasaki considers all @Tesla critique or inquiry rhetorical. Don't hold your breath for an answer. But if you scare his firm enough, they send out these Stepford Brokers to cheer.
If @Tesla was an airline, I bet their planes would have no wings.
We've updated our bug bounty terms, now if you accidentally brick your car doing security research we'll help you fix it https://www. tesla.com/about/security (cc @Tesla @Bugcrowd @defcon @elonmusk @AmitElazari @k3r3n )
@elonmusk @tesla Maybe the charing stations in public places should be painted to make it obvious that they're there for a particular purpose. We see far too many ICE vehicles parked blocking the chargers. Just a thought... https:// goo.gl/images/xBbJuE
#Friends i #need your #help ! Where to write if one company deceives people and calls itself #Tesla 's official representative! Although it's not really true! @Tesla @TeslaMotorsClub @elonmusk @ElonMuskNewsOrg @Elon_Musk_World #TeslaSupport
@Tesla @elonmusk hoping the 'big investment in US' from Apple is in reference to Tesla take private, Tom Cook don't miss this opportunity!
Got to sit in my first @Tesla Model X today. #LifeGoals pic.twitter.com/iAC5yDLfi6
In other news @elonmusk announced @Tesla short-shorts for sale, and @MMFlint #MichaelMoore is releasing a real-time investigative documentary that, if journalistic in nature as advertised, would bring down Trump. And if it does bring him down, why wait to release? #libertyforsale
