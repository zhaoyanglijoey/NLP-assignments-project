@britneyspears when you are talking about infidelity you have to know that sex is really very important. I showed you that very clear, why you suspended my email address? Are you really a shy girl? We need to be even closer!
@britneyspears Britney if you have tendency with homosexuality we will break up. Show that you are a real woman and that you are very faithful to me, your real husband and care giver.

@britneyspears I was destined to be a nobody from LA, but chose another route with my life. Read my book "Trailer Park to White House" by Asher Shannon on Amazon. Your start in life doesn't have to be your end.
I wish somewhere in the universe there was a full mp3 version of @britneyspears cover of Trouble by Elvis.

@britneyspears I fell in love with you for 2 reasons, you are not an arrogant person and because you are a great teacher in love. Some women are flirting with snobism and don't take initiative in love at the same time.
Why did no one tag @britneyspears ? The comments are golden
I love a busy rush hour on the London Tube when you notice at close range that the tattooed biker beside you is actually reading the Britney Spears biography life is full of surprises with @britneyspears

I almost had an anxiety attack at the entrance to the @britneyspears concert in #Antwerpen due to the @sportpaleis 's not preventing the people from pushing from behind to force us in the front through the narrow doors. This is a serious threat to our integrity and well-being.
