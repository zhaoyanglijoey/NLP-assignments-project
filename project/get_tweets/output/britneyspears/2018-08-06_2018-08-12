What is wrong with you people? She is a human being just like us. The girl drives through McDonalds no differently than you do. Some of you people need priorities because @britneyspears is not a queen of anything. Geez being a fan and being an obsessed loser are different
@britneyspears Im taking my partner to see you at the 02 arena in London on August 24th as a 40th birthday present and would really like a birthday message on that night from you She is crazy about you and the concert is her dream and I want to make it more special for her
#Artist PLylist @britneyspears @pitbull @jtimberlake
You're so true. Don't know how someone can blame or hate this sweetheart @britneyspears
Nice outfit and killer abs Britney Spears. @britneyspears
Yes @britneyspears is hot. We all get it. What isn't hot is how 90% of her posts she is wanting to show you how hot she is. This seems to me like a need for self-gratification from others. I would say those calling her "queen" and worshipping her probably should think twice

I have always been an outcast gay because I can not understand people going to the concerts of artists like @britneyspears . Those who sound good on the studio records, but are totally unable to sing live. If it is for the "show", then you must be really shallow.
@britneyspears that photo i saw of you standing in the mirror was real sexy

One time at comp, my teammates tried to make fun of me by being like "so Jack, I heard you've been listening to @britneyspears in your car," and I was like "...yes, and?" and they had no response because they really expected me to be ashamed of that. I think about that a lot.
