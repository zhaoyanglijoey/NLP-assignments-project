@britneyspears I was destined to be a nobody from LA, but chose another route with my life. Read my book "Trailer Park to White House" by Asher Shannon on Amazon. Your start in life doesn't have to be your end.
I wish somewhere in the universe there was a full mp3 version of @britneyspears cover of Trouble by Elvis.
