Until I looked it up right now, I misheard the part of @britneyspears "Piece of Me" that says, "No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean please." I heard, "Number one hispanic in the industry", which I thought was really weird and I had no idea what it was referring to.
Whenever I feel alone I listen I Will Be There by @britneyspears it's just making me feel like I'm not alone so thank you love xoxo.
