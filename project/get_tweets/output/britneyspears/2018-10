@britneyspears Australia is going to vote for legal abortion up to 22 weeks no questions asked and up till last day without criminal conviction! For me this is very similar to what that guy with the funny mustache did in 1940-1945. Abortion law as it is should be good enough!

@britneyspears yr announcement, either u r pregnant or have a new album. yr skirt gets any shorter they'll hv to arrest you.

I'm incredibility annoyed that a song called "Party in the USA" is stuck in my head after hearing it on the radio at lunch. Though she gave a shout out to @S_C_ and @britneyspears it is still not something I want in my dome while I'm working.

Yo. @jennylsq . Thanks for playing that @lilyallen cover of The Clash. Can you play her cover of "Toxic" by @britneyspears at some point today?!
@jtimberlake Leave @britneyspears Out of your ugly ass noodle fuck mouth. You need a reality check, she made you and gave you a name in a time when you didn't even know how to be a solo artist. She's been through a lot, and it's no good doing this childish thing now. Fuck u

Ok Mr. @baptistepiriou You better watch your mouth! @britneyspears & I are the same age (twins) & there is no need to talk about decades here. We only talk about 90's & 2000's. We are still in the 2000's! We refuse to accept decades at our age. I heart you but no decades please

It is so crazy that Toxic is HUGE & not on this list. "Criminal" & "Make Me" are not even Britney Anthems! @britneyspears knows I love her even if she hums a song so I don't have to tell you that every song is a hit.
