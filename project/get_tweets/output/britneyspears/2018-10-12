What the actual fuck? Do you think the Illuminati organised this? Or Britney's team heard about Joe bigging her up on the podcast and chose Pump it Up? Or it's just a coincidence? (Or do you believe in synchronicity / serendipity / Joe the prophet?) @TheEllenShow @britneyspears
@britneyspears yr announcement, either u r pregnant or have a new album. yr skirt gets any shorter they'll hv to arrest you.
@britneyspears since your announcement coincides with #SpiritDay October 18th, does it have something to do with that?
Looking great @britneyspears
