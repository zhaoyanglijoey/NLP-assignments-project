Absolutely disgusted at @Ticketmaster . Can't see @britneyspears because I'm British?? And can't speak to anyone about it either (been trying for over 13 hours). We wanted to see her the night before our wedding in Vegas but apparently we can't pic.twitter.com/d0uC6dP1oR
Watch: @britneyspears does backflips while listening to @JTimberlake 's "Man of the Woods." http:// bit.ly/BritneySpearsLV
Sean Preston = @kevinfederline 2.0 Jayden James = @britneyspears 2.0 Hey @jamielynnspears BTW ! pic.twitter.com/TVRZ2LoLDJ
This song reminds me of that @britneyspears song, Work Bitch. I wonder what they both do similar in the instrumental part of the song. Does it have a specific name? #artistsontwitter #musicians #MusicMonday #80s #music pic.twitter.com/mjHrF9KFm5
