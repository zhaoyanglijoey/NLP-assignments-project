@britneyspears I was born on October 9 1980, I'm a pure Libra close to Scorpio, I'm not a Libra close to Virgo, I am more sensual and truthful. Gianni Versace was born on December 2 as well but he was a homosexual man, I have nothing in common with him!
@britneyspears I'm pretty sure that you don't have time to manage your twitter ... you don't need all of this ! People around you are using you , you don't need them ! Stop working and take back your 2 kids and enjoy life !! It's very short ! And stop paying for your ex husband.

@britneyspears you are Sagittarius, your zodiac sign fits so well with Greece and Italy. At the age of Aquarius you are a big winner and I am the same. The zodiac as we know it represents mostly Europeans, Pisces is at the edge.
Good luck on your last Piece of me show tonight @britneyspears You never disappoint. You're the best. Love you legend #PieceOfMeTour #ItsBritneyBitch
My evening will be listening to @britneyspears from Blackpool, from my back garden. So would have loved to have gone, but, having no one to actually go with, this will have to do! #Blackpool #ItsBritneyBitch

@britneyspears your zodiac sign really turns me on! You look also like a female Aries, I like your Italian taste and sense of humor. Paris is the city of glamour and fake smiles as well. French guys are so feminine and snob.
