Who would you hit the road with on your dream tour (other than @britneyspears , of course)?
@britneyspears The concert was fantastic juice me and my dad we loved the only thing that made me sad is that I wanted to give you a gift a heart pendant with a picture of you with Preston and Jayden I look for the door of I found it but I was told that it could not take my gift
@britneyspears @TheBritneyArmy do you think this is acceptable? All I did was tweet live Nation and ask to answer an email as to where my photo from Dublin was . pic.twitter.com/C2tc5BvBXA
Still can't get over the fact I was in the same room as @britneyspears last night and she hilariously mistook a guys name calling him URINE instead of Ewan!

So the guy @britneyspears brought on stage in Glasgow is a Trump supporter. Appears Britney got his name correct, definitely Urine. pic.twitter.com/3BOz29NalZ
