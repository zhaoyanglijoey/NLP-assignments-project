Getting ready to watch the #IHeartRadioMMVAs , pretending that @britneyspears performed this iconic song there. Guess it'll just have to be our #SongOfTheDay ! https:// youtu.be/aQ9kGdKhhtE
This just isn't good enough. I honestly thought @britneyspears would know better than to allow that waste of human skin to be part of her show and sully her good name. Very surprised too that @TheO2 allowed it when they project such a wholesome image.. I am absolutely livid.
Look. @britneyspears was pretty fucking epic but the real highlight was when she referred to a sassy audience participator as Knobbert. Five times. Before he corrected "Robert". I. Died. #knobbertistherealhero
Absolutely disgusted that tonight when seeing @britneyspears at @TheO2 they were still supporting Chris Brown as part of @pitbull 's set. Very angry that some of the money we spent will go to that disgusting bully #unacceptable
Two years ago today @britneyspears took this incredible album out. Still so underrated! Great album! #Glory pic.twitter.com/J2n0F4MUGR

@britneyspears worst experience ever, laughing at your fans is not professional

@britneyspears Out of all the concerts myself and my daughter have ever been too at the 02 London. We have never had to leave because of the music being to loud. My daughter was in tears because her ears were sore. What a wasted night

Thinking about what my fav @britneyspears song is, so many good ones but my fav would defo be 'Circus'. Like, if I was a Britney song I would be 'Circus'.
