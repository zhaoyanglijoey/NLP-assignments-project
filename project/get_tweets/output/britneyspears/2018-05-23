Te superou, @britneyspears ?
@kevinfederline @britneyspears Kevin, I'm nobody to u but I am a father of 3 daughter's and it doesn't take hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of kids each year man. I don't have much but my kids were all taken care of each year for less money.....
@britneyspears Kevin needs to give up his d.j and da icing if he can't make it and move on to something else. Spoil your kids! You have every rite! You can't help it that he isn't as happening as you! You are the one that made his name famous, not him .
@britneyspears oh my gosh! Doesn't that man get enough mo ey from you already! It's been how many years? C'mon! Dude step up! Stop living off your ex wife and be a mature man. Sorry Britt, but that's just sorry on his part.
Some #WednesdayWisdom for @KevinFederline ... it's time to stop mooching off @BritneySpears and get a job to support all your kids and current wife. Just because #Britney is making more money doesn't mean YOU are entitled to more? #bum #mooch #Golddigger #lazy

I hope the judge laughs in @kevinfederline face what a piece of trash! I'd like @britneyspears but we all can't get what we want! Be a dad get off your ass & make money if you need more. Fine example your setting for your kids
@britneyspears dont give in to that shiester #kevin keep what you earned and let that moocher support his own. Hes only trying to get more off of you to support his other kids.... #PATHETIC
Is this a man? As the saying goes, when you lay down with dogs, you get fleas. @britneyspears should have had kids with her equal. Nobody needs that obscene amount of money to live on monthly, so its not child support he seeks.The love of money is the root of all evil. No shame.

@kevinfederline do you really need more than $20,000 a month child support. If you can't live off $20k, something is wrong with your budget. @britneyspears
@kevinfederline said he's not as successful putting out music as he was in 2008, are you dreaming? MOST music artists music isn't selling like it used too. Stop the excuses and be a man to @britneyspears @SharJackson and Victoria. He likes to fuck but not support all his kids.
