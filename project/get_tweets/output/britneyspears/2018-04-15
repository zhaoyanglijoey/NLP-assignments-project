I love @britneyspears
Oh..oh ok. RT @britneyspears : some days you just got to dance! pic.twitter.com/FNSoR0GNne
@britneyspears is my favorite person on this planet
@britneyspears Hey Brit. One more thing. I don't have the usual hangups people have when it comes to a man and a woman being friends and I think you are the same way. I am not looking for a relationship, just a friendship, two people talking, you understand?
@britneyspears Hey Brit. Gonna call it a night on Twitter. Take care. Sleep well.
@britneyspears Hey Brit. I decided I am going to write to you everyday from now on. Maybe one day you will see my tweets to you and respond. You are such a strong woman and such an inspiration to young people, especially young mothers. Good job, Brit.
@britneyspears Hey Brit. I would really love to see one of your concerts one day. You are such a talented dancer and singer and seeing you live would be great. Maybe one day.....I know you have dealt with a lot in your life and I sympathize, keep moving forward, Brit.
@britneyspears thank you for always shining so bright... you are truly the purest soul left on this earth. LITERALLY. LYSM.
@britneyspears Hey Brit. Like I said, I haven't been in a relationship in so long. I barely know how to be around women anymore. I have a girlfriend who lives in Ukraine. She is coming to visit me this summer. I am really excited. I have been alone too long...
@britneyspears Hey Brit. After my girlfriend broke up with me, I became a drunk. For many years I sat on bar stools feeling sorry for myself. When I cleaned up and became a normal social drinker, the world opened up to me. I have friends now.
@britneyspears Hey Brit. My family is the most important thing to me. I don't have any children. I actually haven't been in a relationship in 18 years. My girlfriend in college cheated on me and broke my heart then broke up with me. I spend a long time in isolation.
Ayer pasaron @britneyspears en el boliche. Se ve que escucharon mis plegarias
Im not one for acapellas but this is amazing @britneyspears https:// youtu.be/kiTHZmYl-oo
@britneyspears Hey Brit. I am curious to know what you are most grateful for in your life. For me it is my mom. She is the best. She has been by my side in my worst moments and her love has never wavered. Do you feel that way towards one or both of your parents?
@britneyspears Hey Brit. I don't know why I am opening up to you on here, but I just think it is cool that the internet allows us to write to virtually anybody. I don't talk to people of your social level except that Delaney Jane responded to my questions. a friend for life her.
@britneyspears Hey Brit. So tonight I am just hanging out in my room drinking champagne and smoking cigarettes. Lol. I found the champagne in the cabinet earlier. I don't drink much but tonight I felt like having something fun. Do you ever drink alcohol?
@britneyspears Hey Brit. Oh, I am 37 years old by the way. My birthday is on April 27. I don't know how I feel about growing older. In my mind, I still feel like I am 21 and that I can do the things I did when I was that age. But I know I am aging. Do you ever feel like that?
@britneyspears Hey Brit. It is hard caring for my gramma. I have my own room upstairs and I don't have to care for my gramma like my mom does. My gramma can't remember that my grandpa died almost a year ago and asks us everyday where grandpa is...
@britneyspears Hey Brit. So like I said, I am essentially retired, living on disability and I have a lot of time to sit and think. I live in a nice home with my mom and gramma. My gramma has severe dementia and is going to a nursing home soon.
@britneyspears Hey Brit. I know you don't talk to peons like me. But I have always enjoyed your music, (even as a guy, yes I like your music Brit). You are very beautiful and you seem to be a great mother you loves her children very much. And I know you work hard for your success
@britneyspears Hey Brit. The medical system doesn't understand people like us. They think something is wrong with us. I am just a very spiritually sensitive person. In all illness, I believe there is a spiritual aspect to it that can be healed just like a physical symptom.
@britneyspears Hey Brit. Hope you liked my poem. I have hundreds of them. You know, you and I have a few things in common. I too spent time in psychiatric care. I am on disability for a mental disorder that is incurable (I just don't want to come out and tell you my diagnosis).
@britneyspears Hey Brit. Ok, here is my poem. True Love, a poem by Lee Timmer. First true love, Found and lost, Second true love, Turned to frost, Third true love, Will it succeed? Try to stay tuned, For a happy ending indeed...
@britneyspears Hey Brit. I am a writer and a poet. I will showcase one of my favorite poems to you now. TA DA. Sorry, false alarm. In the next tweet, I will show you my poem. Not even room in this one, lol...
@britneyspears Add new songs to piece of me!
Is that @selenagomez doing @DerrickBarry doing @britneyspears ?
@britneyspears Hey Brit. I know you don't read all the tweets that are sent to you. I am sure your management filters out most if not all. But at least this way their will be a record of my words to you if you ever notice me and want to respond. First you should know I'm a writer
@britneyspears Hey Brit. Sorry for being so informal. My name is Lee. I feel I know you a little. I talked to a scammer by DM for awhile who was using your name as her own. Lol. We don't know each other at all, but we have had similar experiences...More in the next tweet.

Watching @TarynManning in 'Crossroads'. This film starts off as 'Now and then' then morphs into 'American Pie' and then attempts to be a bit arty in the middle. It's an OK film but I suspect if @britneyspears wasn't in it, it'd not have made $61 million
