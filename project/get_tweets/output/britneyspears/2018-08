Brighton @PrideBrighton lacks the infrastructure to host @britneyspears for a festival. This is a direct failure of the Tory government and lack of investment in public services. Britney deserved better.

@britneyspears our love affair was the kindest and brightest for over a century and a half according to the Roman Catholic Church. This is pure evidence, not a silly joke. The triumph of love and youth in full perspective.

the role of tonal functions was gradually weakened. I can't pinpoint a specific turning point--though I can point to specific albums/songs that triggered my awareness of what was going on, like @britneyspears #Blackout and #FemmeFatale and the @rihanna & @CalvinHarris (cont.)

Honestly @britneyspears Greatest Hits: My Prerogative album is the best pop album.
One of my favorite things is seeing what @dirtbagalien comments on every @britneyspears post on Instagram.
Gracias Britney por este artista @britneyspears https:// youtu.be/IC8qPpnD0uE
Woooh can't wait to see you in Dublin soon I'm big fan of yours since forever @britneyspears would love to meet you #please #makemydreamscometrue #Ireland
@britneyspears Gurl you are so pic.twitter.com/McOsHDg0QX
What is wrong with you people? She is a human being just like us. The girl drives through McDonalds no differently than you do. Some of you people need priorities because @britneyspears is not a queen of anything. Geez being a fan and being an obsessed loser are different
@britneyspears Im taking my partner to see you at the 02 arena in London on August 24th as a 40th birthday present and would really like a birthday message on that night from you She is crazy about you and the concert is her dream and I want to make it more special for her
#Artist PLylist @britneyspears @pitbull @jtimberlake
You're so true. Don't know how someone can blame or hate this sweetheart @britneyspears
Nice outfit and killer abs Britney Spears. @britneyspears
Yes @britneyspears is hot. We all get it. What isn't hot is how 90% of her posts she is wanting to show you how hot she is. This seems to me like a need for self-gratification from others. I would say those calling her "queen" and worshipping her probably should think twice

@britneyspears I fell in love with you for 2 reasons, you are not an arrogant person and because you are a great teacher in love. Some women are flirting with snobism and don't take initiative in love at the same time.
Why did no one tag @britneyspears ? The comments are golden

Who would you hit the road with on your dream tour (other than @britneyspears , of course)?
@britneyspears The concert was fantastic juice me and my dad we loved the only thing that made me sad is that I wanted to give you a gift a heart pendant with a picture of you with Preston and Jayden I look for the door of I found it but I was told that it could not take my gift
@britneyspears @TheBritneyArmy do you think this is acceptable? All I did was tweet live Nation and ask to answer an email as to where my photo from Dublin was . pic.twitter.com/C2tc5BvBXA
Still can't get over the fact I was in the same room as @britneyspears last night and she hilariously mistook a guys name calling him URINE instead of Ewan!

Getting ready to watch the #IHeartRadioMMVAs , pretending that @britneyspears performed this iconic song there. Guess it'll just have to be our #SongOfTheDay ! https:// youtu.be/aQ9kGdKhhtE
This just isn't good enough. I honestly thought @britneyspears would know better than to allow that waste of human skin to be part of her show and sully her good name. Very surprised too that @TheO2 allowed it when they project such a wholesome image.. I am absolutely livid.
Look. @britneyspears was pretty fucking epic but the real highlight was when she referred to a sassy audience participator as Knobbert. Five times. Before he corrected "Robert". I. Died. #knobbertistherealhero
Absolutely disgusted that tonight when seeing @britneyspears at @TheO2 they were still supporting Chris Brown as part of @pitbull 's set. Very angry that some of the money we spent will go to that disgusting bully #unacceptable
Two years ago today @britneyspears took this incredible album out. Still so underrated! Great album! #Glory pic.twitter.com/J2n0F4MUGR

@britneyspears Out of all the concerts myself and my daughter have ever been too at the 02 London. We have never had to leave because of the music being to loud. My daughter was in tears because her ears were sore. What a wasted night
