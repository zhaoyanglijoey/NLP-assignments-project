Hmm, hats never suit me and the person behind me might not be too pleased if they can't see because of my straw fedora. A @britneyspears concert is one of very few places my wife wouldn't object to me wearing socks and sandals.
@britneyspears
I'm so excited for @britneyspears tonight
But then how would @britneyspears know that I was there??
