Didn't anyone else think she looks ridiculous trying to dance on that small platform? The best she can do is that weird, knee bend motion. @britneyspears #NewYearsEve2018
Thank you @britneyspears for an amazing night at your last Piece Of Me show! You were my first album I ever bought and ten years later my first concert. Truly the best day of my life
Dance moves? When she was up in that tree, she looked ridiculous dancing. And at least have the mic in front of your face, @britneyspears #BRITNEYxRockinEve

Truly an #icon she is incredible. When I saw her and she walked by I suddenly stopped screaming. I froze couldn't believe she was so close to me. #PieceOfMe was amazing. So blessed to have seen the show twice. @britneyspears pic.twitter.com/5D6SreSnDj
Soooooooooooo BRITNEY FUCKING SLAYED LAST NIGHT! @britneyspears GET BACK ON THE ROAD SOON! You were my first Concert in 2001.... I NEED TO SEE YOU AGAIN
So what on Earth is this secret @britneyspears project???
@britneyspears
Its 2018 that means new music and albums from @britneyspears @IGGYAZALEA @LilKim @MissyElliott !!!
Its #2018 and @britneyspears is still pretty terrible lol. Of ALL the acts that came out or were discovered this year, WHY @ABCNetwork ? Was she the lowest bidder? LipSync, Awkward dance moves, and terrible music. Heres a resolution for America, have better standards in music!
