@britneyspears hands down
@Normani should definitely be asked to do a @britneyspears tribute. @britneyspears was a judge on X-Factor the year @FifthHarmony was put together and @Normani literally can imitate @britneyspears vocally. There are multiple videos showing @Normani imitating Britney. #TheNation

I read on Twitter how fans felt ashamed of being with @britneyspears because she doesn't show respect for any one including disabled people! It is totally disgusting how you talk about your love for your fans if you had respect you would remember that you were Not in Blackpool
@britneyspears #PCAs #PieceOfMeTour
Dear @britneyspears meet and greets are for people who appreciate and love their fans so much.Britney do you have an idea of how much money your fans pay just for your meet and greets and in return you completely isolate yourself and stand like a zombie and you wonder why fans go

So for my morning commute I put on a @britneyspears playlist.. not at all what I expected Britney to sound like.
. @entylawyer sez: @BritneySpears is off of her meds and that's why she's been acting out. In a perfect world, she wants to go back to Louisiana but she's too much of a money maker to do that right now.
You've been asking for this, and it's FINALLY back! Pre-order the ultimate @britneyspears classic "...Baby One More Time" on vinyl before it's gone again! https:// bddy.me/2NVw0mK pic.twitter.com/G8ATo1G0m0
