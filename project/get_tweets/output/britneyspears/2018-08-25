If I didn't have plans today and tomorrow I would have gone to all 3 o2 shows to see @britneyspears All her old school pop songs. Felt like I was 11 again. Last night was the same show I saw in Vegas 4 years ago and it was still absolutely brilliant. #PieceOfMeTour

@britneyspears we are sat on B1V14 and 13
It was so disappointing seeing @britneyspears mime every single song at the O2 last night no engery at all with lips being completely out of sync with music. At least Pitbull was worth seeing. One very disappointed fan - was expecting a bit of mining but not the whole set
