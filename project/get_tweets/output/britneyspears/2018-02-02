Funny. While @britneyspears waited for her Man on the Moon in #Glory @jtimberlake says he is a #ManoftheWoods #Track4 No relation whatsoever. #PopCulture
Now back to this amazing and critically acclaimed album You did THAT @britneyspears pic.twitter.com/aPk1iOgKQ6
I heart @britneyspears ! pic.twitter.com/1hnMKBna58
If the #SpiceGirls are reuniting for a 2018 tour the same year I'm going to see @jtimberlake and @britneyspears , I'm gonna lose my damn mind. Can @NSYNC just get back together already?!
No paying or viewing for me, @jtimberlake IS A TRAITOR for not including @JanetJackson & @britneyspears "HE SHOULD HAVE SET TERMS"! @budweiserusa @pepsi & @GoDaddy you KNOW BETTER THAN supporting TRAITORS & ABUSERS! MEMO HAS "OPTED OUT" OF THE @SuperBowl & YOU
I just entered to win @britneyspears tickets from @hot995 ! http:// ul.ink/AY42-4X2P9E_T
Toxic by @britneyspears is such a bop
I really hope during the Super Bowl that @britneyspears and @JanetJackson make a surprise appearance with @jtimberlake if this happens this will be the best Super Bowl ever! #BritneyArmy #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftime #SuperBowlLII
@britneyspears tickets are too dear to go to them to see her in the UK I think its disgusting

@britneyspears notice me queen
@britneyspears Yayyyy I finally got tickets today after 4 times trying see you in Brighton Brit xxx
PS no one should be watching @jtimberlake half time show unless he publicly apologizes to @JanetJackson or at least brings her out. As well as @britneyspears who he owes his whole solo career to. #ManOfTheWoods #ManOfTheGarbage #NFLHalftimeShow
I think it would be 1,000 times more epic if he brought @britneyspears on. OMG!! I'm getting excited just thinking about that

On the note of Britney, I did an airport drop off the other day and made the passenger listen to @britneyspears for the whole journey, accompanied by my terrible singing. I think they secretly enjoyed it. #notreally #badsinging #oopsididitagain pic.twitter.com/uhwg6OU1QR

My @britneyspears #songoftheday is "I Love Rock 'N' Roll" The best thing about this cover is, in "Crossroads" Britney sings it for karaoke in the movie. So it made a lot of sense to have this be on her album. Also not said enough, but that's a great movie. pic.twitter.com/EPcCbYSUZ0
