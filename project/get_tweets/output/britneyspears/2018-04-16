@britneyspears Hey Brit. As I am telling a couple others, love is the substance, the flow, that makes up everything in any reality. It is love that connects us always, no matter the distance or time. Your music and presence is pure love, given freely to those who hear or see you.

@britneyspears then he realized Airlie meant Timberlake to you, and he wanted to bash you again, but realized he had gone too far already
@britneyspears he bashed you over palm bouquets instead of marigolds...coz he realised that meant Fed Ex
@britneyspears if I had married in Airlie, like I wanted to, instead of divorce, I would have had palm leaves at the church, and little palm trees on the reception tables
