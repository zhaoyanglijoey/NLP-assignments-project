@britneyspears God love you for earning whatever you can. No one should be able to try to syphon off your earnings. Your children will inherit all your assets so don't let anyone try to take these assets from you while you are alive. Hope to see your show in LV.
@britneyspears our love affair was the kindest and brightest for over a century and a half according to the Roman Catholic Church. This is pure evidence, not a silly joke. The triumph of love and youth in full perspective.
