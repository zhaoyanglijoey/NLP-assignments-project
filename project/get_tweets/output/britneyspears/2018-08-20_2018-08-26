Hmm, hats never suit me and the person behind me might not be too pleased if they can't see because of my straw fedora. A @britneyspears concert is one of very few places my wife wouldn't object to me wearing socks and sandals.
@britneyspears
I'm so excited for @britneyspears tonight
But then how would @britneyspears know that I was there??

Who would you hit the road with on your dream tour (other than @britneyspears , of course)?
@britneyspears The concert was fantastic juice me and my dad we loved the only thing that made me sad is that I wanted to give you a gift a heart pendant with a picture of you with Preston and Jayden I look for the door of I found it but I was told that it could not take my gift
@britneyspears @TheBritneyArmy do you think this is acceptable? All I did was tweet live Nation and ask to answer an email as to where my photo from Dublin was . pic.twitter.com/C2tc5BvBXA
Still can't get over the fact I was in the same room as @britneyspears last night and she hilariously mistook a guys name calling him URINE instead of Ewan!

It was so disappointing seeing @britneyspears mime every single song at the O2 last night no engery at all with lips being completely out of sync with music. At least Pitbull was worth seeing. One very disappointed fan - was expecting a bit of mining but not the whole set

Getting ready to watch the #IHeartRadioMMVAs , pretending that @britneyspears performed this iconic song there. Guess it'll just have to be our #SongOfTheDay ! https:// youtu.be/aQ9kGdKhhtE
This just isn't good enough. I honestly thought @britneyspears would know better than to allow that waste of human skin to be part of her show and sully her good name. Very surprised too that @TheO2 allowed it when they project such a wholesome image.. I am absolutely livid.
Look. @britneyspears was pretty fucking epic but the real highlight was when she referred to a sassy audience participator as Knobbert. Five times. Before he corrected "Robert". I. Died. #knobbertistherealhero
Absolutely disgusted that tonight when seeing @britneyspears at @TheO2 they were still supporting Chris Brown as part of @pitbull 's set. Very angry that some of the money we spent will go to that disgusting bully #unacceptable
Two years ago today @britneyspears took this incredible album out. Still so underrated! Great album! #Glory pic.twitter.com/J2n0F4MUGR

@britneyspears Out of all the concerts myself and my daughter have ever been too at the 02 London. We have never had to leave because of the music being to loud. My daughter was in tears because her ears were sore. What a wasted night
