Seriously @etnow THAT was the big @britneyspears announcement? A perfume that is already out and was already announced? Way to disappoint fans who expected something more. Anything for ratings I guess
@britneyspears I love to see you dance and your new moves, I used to dance and loved it, then when I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2013 that changed everything, I can no longer dance the way I did. Really not any more at all
I need more followers!! @britneyspears #britneyspears fans #F4F ?!?

Listening to @uknowrho singing to @britneyspears
@britneyspears Piece of me Tour crowd was much better than the residency crowd. Locals seem to just stand and watch or even SIT, as if they only went to the show because it was something to do to kill time. Tour fans were crazy! Screaming, singing and dancing... it was amazing
Fox News is about to be shook. #Prerogative @britneyspears

#Artist PLylist @britneyspears @rickyrozay @steveaoki
perfume and cologne were already non binary to me (personally) but it is important to release fragrances that specifically say "gender neutral" because we matter so thank you @britneyspears you've always been my star
