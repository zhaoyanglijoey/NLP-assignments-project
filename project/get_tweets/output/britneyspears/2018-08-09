2018 has really been that year for @britneyspears . She is on a sold out tour, remains unbothered by any hate that gets thrown at her and remains one of the most humble female icons out there. This year has proved even more how much the world loves Britney Jean Spears. pic.twitter.com/2cWyEY7KlD

What I'm trying to do is to combine what I've heard from sources like you, Golan, and McKee with my own analysis of Max Martin songs, especially from the "strict" period with @katyperry and @britneyspears , and to some extent @taylorswift13 and arrive at some insight into the MM.

Let's revisit @britneyspears ' "Till the World Ends". There are 6 distinct sections in this song - verse, prechorus, chorus, postchorus, and the two parts of the bridge, but Martin and the other writers producers recycle and CHANGE THINGS OTHER THAN THE MELODY. pic.twitter.com/ToTfw1sVKi

How good will it be if we honour those who look to us for help? #honor @bellanaija #proverb #payback @britneyspears @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @BigBroAfrica @NICKIMINAJ @jumokeadenowo
So, you were fully paid. Now that they have made it, they dont feel they owe you anything because they traded what was precious to them for your help. #honor @bellanaija #proverb #pay @britneyspears @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @BigBroAfrica @NICKIMINAJ NICKIMINAJ
When you kept them waiting because you are their oga (boss) and they are omose (apprentice), they were trading their self worth for your help. #honor @bellanaija #proverb #payback @britneyspears @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @BigBroAfrica @NICKIMINAJ
When you raised your voice at them just because you were helping them and they said nothing, they were paying the price. #honour @bellanaija #wiseword #payback @StellaMcCartney @ste @britneyspears @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @SPNigeria @BigBroAfrica @NICKIMINAJ
You made them lose their self esteem just because you wanted to help them. They traded their self esteem for the help. #honour @bellanaija @nig #wiseword #payback @StellaMcCartney @ste @britneyspears @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @SPNigeria @BigBroAfrica @NICKIMINAJ
You wonder why they didn't pay you back after you have helped them. They paid you back, you just didn't know it. #honour @bellanaija @nig #wiseword #payback @StellaMcCartney @ste @britneyspears @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @SPNigeria @BigBroAfrica @NICKIMINAJ

Honestly @britneyspears Greatest Hits: My Prerogative album is the best pop album.
One of my favorite things is seeing what @dirtbagalien comments on every @britneyspears post on Instagram.
Gracias Britney por este artista @britneyspears https:// youtu.be/IC8qPpnD0uE
Woooh can't wait to see you in Dublin soon I'm big fan of yours since forever @britneyspears would love to meet you #please #makemydreamscometrue #Ireland
@britneyspears Gurl you are so pic.twitter.com/McOsHDg0QX
What is wrong with you people? She is a human being just like us. The girl drives through McDonalds no differently than you do. Some of you people need priorities because @britneyspears is not a queen of anything. Geez being a fan and being an obsessed loser are different
@britneyspears Im taking my partner to see you at the 02 arena in London on August 24th as a 40th birthday present and would really like a birthday message on that night from you She is crazy about you and the concert is her dream and I want to make it more special for her
#Artist PLylist @britneyspears @pitbull @jtimberlake
You're so true. Don't know how someone can blame or hate this sweetheart @britneyspears
Nice outfit and killer abs Britney Spears. @britneyspears
Yes @britneyspears is hot. We all get it. What isn't hot is how 90% of her posts she is wanting to show you how hot she is. This seems to me like a need for self-gratification from others. I would say those calling her "queen" and worshipping her probably should think twice
