@britneyspears I was born on October 9 1980, I'm a pure Libra close to Scorpio, I'm not a Libra close to Virgo, I am more sensual and truthful. Gianni Versace was born on December 2 as well but he was a homosexual man, I have nothing in common with him!
@britneyspears I'm pretty sure that you don't have time to manage your twitter ... you don't need all of this ! People around you are using you , you don't need them ! Stop working and take back your 2 kids and enjoy life !! It's very short ! And stop paying for your ex husband.

@britneyspears The age of Pisces was a total failure for us. The age of Capricorn will be the same, we have now 2000 years of happiness and self fullfilment. And lots of sex!!!

Do You Wanna Come Over? - @britneyspears https:// youtu.be/VikwNzcCNyQ
@britneyspears you are Sagittarius, your zodiac sign fits so well with Greece and Italy. At the age of Aquarius you are a big winner and I am the same. The zodiac as we know it represents mostly Europeans, Pisces is at the edge.
Good luck on your last Piece of me show tonight @britneyspears You never disappoint. You're the best. Love you legend #PieceOfMeTour #ItsBritneyBitch
My evening will be listening to @britneyspears from Blackpool, from my back garden. So would have loved to have gone, but, having no one to actually go with, this will have to do! #Blackpool #ItsBritneyBitch
Have an amazing last show performing with @britneyspears in Blackpool hope it's been a great tour, you've all made this tour excellent to watch, loved each moment of it

@britneyspears should we still just trust and be faithful?
@britneyspears your zodiac sign really turns me on! You look also like a female Aries, I like your Italian taste and sense of humor. Paris is the city of glamour and fake smiles as well. French guys are so feminine and snob.

Absolutely YES !! A very hard and sweet show ! I loved the moment with @britneyspears !! I saw the concert in 2008 in Rome and in 2009 with my husband @tomlupi75 in Udine MY CITY!!!!! pic.twitter.com/w45AUYvBsl
when I think of how @britneyspears is treating her fans lately and not allowing them to touch her or speak to her in the meet and greet I think "thank God for @MariahCarey ", she is the best with her fans.

When @britneyspears had her mental breakdown, was one of her kids in a developmental leap? Cause if so I get it now.
Back from an amazing weekend at #Blackpool and a great (semi)final of Piece of me by the amazing @britneyspears with @RyanSloey ,now have so much big brother to catch up on, I'm on lockdown.
Absolutely loved seeing @britneyspears in Blackpool this weekend on the #PieceOfMe tour! So much fun!
