@britneyspears I know it's been twenty years but Britney you're still amazing and got me through medical school!! I'm not afraid to admit that as a hetero man!
@enews #QueenofSoul passed away and you guys can't even give her the top story of the day. Is that story of @britneyspears really more important than #arethafranklin ? Very disappointed with the coverage.
