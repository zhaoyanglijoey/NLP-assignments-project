@britneyspears when was the last time you removed your eye makeup and applied fresh eyeliner or washed your hair? Are you OK?
I had a dream that @shanedawson spotted @britneyspears and then teased us saying, "We might have shot a l'il somethin". HMMM.
Now i understand why @britneyspears had a mental breakdown in 2007.
@britneyspears <3

How weird/interesting would it be for celebrities to dress up as themselves for Halloween? Like recreate a look they had from 20-30 years ago. Imagine @britneyspears wearing that Oops I Did it Again outfit in 2018.
