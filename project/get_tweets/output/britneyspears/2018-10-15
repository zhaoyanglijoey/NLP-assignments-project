All @britneyspears songs are sexy af. Brings out my inner femme while working out. Hahahahahahahahahaha
So my client saw me dancing while I was styling her son room & asked me who I was listening to & I told her @britneyspears .... She was so shocked & told me I didn't look like someone that would listen to her.....I love Britney Spears. Black Out & Circus in heavy rotation
And the count down begins... 6 more days until @britneyspears #PieceOfMe in Austin, TX.
It's been over 20 years since @britneyspears and @RyanGosling were co-starring on "The All New Mickey Mouse Club" https:// ihr.fm/2CktaF5
