@britneyspears you are supposed to marry my half-brother, Christopher Cody Willis. He is living in Midlsnd, Texas and born in Colorado City, Texas.
Why is @britneyspears not attending the @AMAs tonight? or @Madonna I liked how @G_Eazy looked anyway #AMAs2018
Yikes by transitive property then @britneyspears is confirmed to be against American servicemen and women? Very tough look for her brand and just character overall

@britneyspears yr announcement, either u r pregnant or have a new album. yr skirt gets any shorter they'll hv to arrest you.
