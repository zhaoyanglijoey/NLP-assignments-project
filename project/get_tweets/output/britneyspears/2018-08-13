@britneyspears when you are talking about infidelity you have to know that sex is really very important. I showed you that very clear, why you suspended my email address? Are you really a shy girl? We need to be even closer!
@britneyspears Britney if you have tendency with homosexuality we will break up. Show that you are a real woman and that you are very faithful to me, your real husband and care giver.
