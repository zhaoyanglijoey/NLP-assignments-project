He is simply a fan...Not only humans like and listen to the queen @britneyspears
@britneyspears @ElizabethArden just thinking, to keep the song title theme going, Stronger, Blackout, Radar, Invitation, Man on the Moon, etc. could make fun titles for a men's cologne. Just a thought. But a Britney cologne would definitely be nice.

Hey @britneyspears @ElizabethArden , can y'all do a designated men's cologne next? While I bought #Prerogative to be supportive of the unisex fragrance, it's a little too sweet for my liking, so I gifted it to someone else. Something more woodsy & less floral/sugary would be nice!
