My specified work in this assignment is to clean the sentences from the book provided by `nltk`, producing a `more_sentences` dataset, investigate the state-of-the-art English parser, and parse the sentencens with the parser to experiment. Although our experiments finally show that the grammars derived from these parsers does not perform as well as grammars derived from `devset.trees`, this step is an important attempt to improve the performance of the grammars. Besides, participating group discussion and giving suggestions on details are also important.
