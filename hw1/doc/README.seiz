#### What I have done for this homework

* Participated in the discussion on how this homework should be done
* Found more texts (from nltk.books) for us to train the grammar and the weights. Formatted them so that they can be processed properly. See moreSentences.py for details.
* Wrote s2.py to generate S2.gr as a 2-gram.
