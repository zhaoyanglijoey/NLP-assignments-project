Whoa there !
Halt !
Who goes there ?
It is I , Arthur , son of Uther Pendragon , from the castle of Camelot .
King of the Britons , defeator of the Saxons , sovereign of all England !
Pull the other one !
I am .
And this my trusty servant Patsy .
We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court of Camelot .
I must speak with your lord and master .
What , ridden on a horse ?
Yes !
You're using coconuts !
What ?
You've got two empty halves of coconut and you 're bangin 'em together .
So ?
We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land , through the kingdom of Mercea , through --
Where 'd you get the coconut ?
We found them .
Found them ?
In Mercea ?
The coconut 's tropical !
What do you mean ?
Well , this is a temperate zone .
The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not strangers to our land .
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate ?
Not at all , they could be carried .
What -- a swallow carrying a coconut ?
It could grip it by the husk !
It 's not a question of where he grips it !
It 's a simple question of weight ratios !
A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound coconut .
Well , it does n't matter .
Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here .
Listen , in order to maintain air - speed velocity , a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second , right ?
Please !
Am I right ?
I'm not interested !
It could be carried by an African swallow !
Oh , yeah , an African swallow maybe , but not a European swallow , that 's my point .
Oh , yeah , I agree with that ...
Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot ? !
But then of course African swallows are not migratory .
Oh , yeah ...
So they could n't bring a coconut back anyway ...
Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together ?
No , they 'd have to have it on a line .
Well , simple !
They 'd just use a standard creeper !
What , held under the dorsal guiding feathers ?
Well , why not ?
Bring out your dead !
Here 's one -- nine pence .
I'm not dead !
What ?
Nothing -- here 's your nine pence .
I'm not dead !
Here -- he says he 's not dead !
Yes , he is .
I'm not !
He is n't .
Well , he will be soon , he 's very ill .
I'm getting better !
No , you 're not -- you 'll be stone dead in a moment .
Oh , I can't take him like that -- it 's against regulations .
I do n't want to go in the cart !
Oh , do n't be such a baby .
I can't take him ...
I feel fine !
Oh , do us a favor ...
I can't .
Well , can you hang around a couple of minutes ?
He wo n't be long .
Naaah , I got to go on to Robinson 's -- they 've lost nine today .
Well , when is your next round ?
Thursday .
I think I 'll go for a walk .
You're not fooling anyone y' know .
Look , is n't there something you can do ?
I feel happy ...
I feel happy .
Ah , thanks very much .
Not at all .
See you on Thursday .
Right .
Who 's that then ?
I do n't know .
Must be a king .
Why ?
He has n't got shit all over him .
Old woman !
Man !
Old Man , sorry .
What knight live in that castle over there ?
I'm thirty seven .
What ?
I'm thirty seven -- I'm not old !
Well , I can't just call you ` Man ' .
Well , you could say ` Dennis ' .
Well , I did n't know you were called ` Dennis . '
Well , you did n't bother to find out , did you ?
I did say sorry about the ` old woman , ' but from the behind you looked --
What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior !
Well , I AM king ...
Oh king , eh , very nice .
An ' how 'd you get that , eh ?
By exploitin ' the workers -- by ' angin ' on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic an ' social differences in our society !
If there 's ever going to be any progress --
Dennis , there 's some lovely filth down here .
Oh -- how d' you do ?
How do you do , good lady .
I am Arthur , King of the Britons .
Who 's castle is that ?
King of the who ?
The Britons .
Who are the Britons ?
Well , we all are .
we're all Britons and I am your king .
I did n't know we had a king .
I thought we were an autonomous collective .
You're fooling yourself .
We're living in a dictatorship .
A self - perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes --
Oh there you go , bringing class into it again .
That 's what it 's all about if only people would --
Please , please good people .
I am in haste .
Who lives in that castle ?
No one live there .
Then who is your lord ?
We do n't have a lord .
What ?
I told you .
We're an anarcho - syndicalist commune .
We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week .
Yes .
But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting .
Yes , I see .
By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs , --
Be quiet !
-- but by a two - thirds majority in the case of more --
Be quiet !
I order you to be quiet !
Order , eh -- who does he think he is ?
I am your king !
Well , I did n't vote for you .
You do n't vote for kings .
Well , ' ow did you become king then ?
The Lady of the Lake ,
her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite , held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I , Arthur , was to carry Excalibur .
That is why I am your king !
Listen -- strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government .
Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses , not from some farcical aquatic ceremony .
Be quiet !
Well you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just ' cause some watery tart threw a sword at you !
Shut up !
I mean , if I went around sayin ' I was an empereror just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me they 'd put me away !
Shut up !
Will you shut up !
Ah , now we see the violence inherent in the system .
Shut up !
Oh !
Come and see the violence inherent in the system !
HELP !
I'm being repressed !
Bloody peasant !
Oh , what a give away .
Did you here that , did you here that , eh ?
That 's what I'm on about -- did you see him repressing me , you saw it did n't you ?
You fight with the strength of many men , Sir knight .
I am Arthur , King of the Britons .
I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in my Court of Camelot .
You have proved yourself worthy ; will you join me ?
You make me sad .
So be it .
Come , Patsy .
None shall pass .
What ?
None shall pass .
I have no quarrel with you , good Sir knight , but I must cross this bridge .
Then you shall die .
I command you as King of the Britons to stand aside !
I move for no man .
So be it !
Now stand aside , worthy adversary .
' Tis but a scratch .
A scratch ?
Your arm 's off !
No , it is n't .
Well , what 's that then ?
I've had worse .
You liar !
Come on you pansy !
Victory is mine !
We thank thee Lord , that in thy merc -
Come on then .
What ?
Have at you !
You are indeed brave , Sir knight , but the fight is mine .
Oh , had enough , eh ?
Look , you stupid bastard , you 've got no arms left .
Yes I have .
Look !
Just a flesh wound .
Look , stop that .
Chicken !
Look , I 'll have your leg .
Right !
Right , I 'll do you for that !
You 'll what ?
Come ' ere !
What are you going to do , bleed on me ?
I'm invincible !
You're a loony .
The Black Knight always triumphs !
Have at you !
Come on then .
All right ; we 'll call it a draw .
Come , Patsy .
Oh , oh , I see , running away then .
You yellow bastards !
Come back here and take what 's coming to you .
I 'll bite your legs off !
A witch !
We've got a witch !
A witch !
We have found a witch , might we burn her ?
Burn her !
Burn !
How do you know she is a witch ?
She looks like one .
Bring her forward .
I'm not a witch .
But you are dressed as one .
They dressed me up like this .
No , we did n't ... no .
And this is n't my nose , it 's a false one .
Well ?
Well , we did do the nose .
The nose ?
And the hat -- but she is a witch !
Burn her !
Witch !
Burn her !
Did you dress her up like this ?
No , no ...
no ... yes .
Yes , yes , a bit , a bit .
She has got a wart .
What makes you think she is a witch ?
Well , she turned me into a newt .
A newt ?
I got better .
Burn her anyway !
Burn !
Burn her !
Quiet , quiet .
Quiet !
There are ways of telling whether she is a witch .
Are there ?
What are they ?
Tell me , what do you do with witches ?
Burn !
Burn , burn them up !
And what do you burn apart from witches ?
More witches !
Wood !
So , why do witches burn ?
B -- ...
' cause they 're made of wood ... ?
Good !
Oh yeah , yeah ...
So , how do we tell whether she is made of wood ?
Build a bridge out of her .
Aah , but can you not also build bridges out of stone ?
Oh , yeah .
Does wood sink in water ?
No , no .
It floats !
Throw her into the pond !
The pond !
What also floats in water ?
Bread !
Apples !
Very small rocks !
Cider !
Great gravy !
Cherries !
Mud !
Churches -- churches !
Lead -- lead !
A duck .
Oooh .
Exactly !
So , logically ... ,
If ...
she. .
weighs the same as a duck , she 's made of wood .
And therefore -- ?
A witch !
We shall use my larger scales !
Right , remove the supports !
A witch !
It 's a fair cop .
Burn her !
Burn !
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science ?
I am Arthur , King of the Britons .
My liege !
Good Sir knight , will you come with me to Camelot , and join us at the Round Table ?
My liege !
I would be honored .
What is your name ?
Bedemir , my leige .
Then I dub you Sir Bedemir , Knight of the Round Table .
The wise Sir Bedemir was the first to join King Arthur 's knights , but other illustrious names were soon to follow : Sir Launcelot the Brave ; Sir Galahad the Pure ; and Sir Robin the Not - quite - so - brave - as - Sir - Launcelot who had nearly fought the Dragon of Agnor , who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill ; and the aptly named Sir Not - appearing - in - this - film .
Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries , the Knights of the Round Table .
And that , my liege , is how we know the Earth to be banana - shaped .
This new learning amazes me , Sir Bedemir .
Explain again how sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes .
Oh , certainly , sir .
Look , my liege !
Camelot !
It 's only a model .
Shhh !
Knights , I bid you welcome to your new home .
Let us ride ...
to Camelot .
We're knights of the round table 
We dance when e'er we're able 
We do routines and parlour scenes 
With footwork impecc - Able .
We dine well here in Camelot 
We eat ham and jam and spam a lot
We're knights of the Round Table 
Our shows are for - mid - able 
Though many times we're given rhymes 
That are quite unsing - able 
We not so fat in Camelot 
We sing from the diaphragm a lot
Oh we're tough and able 
Quite indefatigable 
Between our quests we sequin vests 
And impersonate Clark Gable 
It 's a bit too loud in Camelot 
I have to push the pram a lot .
Well , on second thought , let 's not go to Camelot -- it is a silly place .
Right .
Arthur !
Arthur , King of the Britons !
Oh , do n't grovel !
If there 's one thing I can't stand , it 's people groveling .
Sorry --
And do n't apologize .
Every time I try to talk to someone it 's " sorry this " and " forgive me that " and " I'm not worthy " .
What are you doing now ! ?
I'm averting my eyes , oh Lord .
Well , do n't .
It 's like those miserable Psalms -- they 're so depressing .
Now knock it off !
Yes , Lord .
Right !
Arthur , King of the Britons -- your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times .
Good idea , oh Lord !
' Course it 's a good idea !
Behold !
Arthur , this is the Holy Grail .
Look well , Arthur , for it is your sacred task to seek this Grail .
That is your purpose , Arthur -- the Quest for the Holy Grail .
A blessing !
A blessing from the Lord !
God be praised !
Halt !
Hallo !
' Allo !
Who is zis ?
It is King Arthur , and these are the Knights of the Round Table .
Who 's castle is this ?
This is the castle of Our Master Ruiz ' de lu la Ramper ( sp ? )
Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest .
If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail .
Well , I 'll ask him , but I do n't think he 'll be very keen ...
Uh , he 's already got one , you see ?
What ?
He says they 've already got one !
Are you sure he 's got one ?
Oh , yes , it 's very nice - a I told him we already got one .
Well , um , can we come up and have a look ?
Of course not !
You are English types - a !
Well , what are you then ?
I'm French !
Why do think I have this outrageous accent , you silly king !
What are you doing in England ?
Mind your own business !
If you will not show us the Grail , we shall take your castle by force !
You do n't frighten us , English pig - dogs !
Go and boil your bottoms , sons of a silly person .
I blow my nose at you , so - called Arthur - king , you and all your silly English kaniggets .
Thppppt !
What a strange person .
Now look here , my good man !
I do n't want to talk to you no more , you empty headed animal food trough whopper !
I fart in your general direction !
You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of eldeberries .
Is there someone else up there we could talk to ?
No , now go away or I shall taunt you a second time - a !
Now , this is your last chance .
I've been more than reasonable .
( Fetchez la vache . ) wha ?
( Fetchez la vache ! )
If you do not agree to my commands , then I shall --
Jesus Christ !
Right !
Charge !
Ah , this one is for your mother !
Run away !
Thpppt !
Fiends !
I 'll tear them apart !
No no , no .
Sir !
I have a plan , sir .
ce labon a bunny do wha ?
un cadeau ?
a present !
oh , un cadeau .
oui oui hurry !
wha - ?
let 's go !
What happens now ?
Well , now , uh , Launcelot , Galahad , and I wait until nightfall , and then leap out of the rabbit , taking the French by surprise -- not only by surprise , but totally unarmed !
Who leaps out ?
Uh , Launcelot , Galahad , and I . 
Uh , leap out of the rabbit , uh and uh ... .
Oh ... .
Um , l - look , if we built this large wooden badger --
Run away !
Oh , haw haw haw .
Pictures for Schools , take 8 .
Action !
Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur .
The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise , and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion .
Arthur , having consulted his closest knights , decided that they should separate , and search for the Grail individually .
Now , this is what they did --
Greg !
The Tale of Sir Robin ... .
So each of the knights went their separate ways .
Sir Robin rode north , through the dark forest of Ewing , accompanied by his favorite minstrels .
Bravely bold Sir Robin , rode forth from Camelot .
He was not afraid to die , o Brave Sir Robin .
He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways .
Brave , brave , brave , brave Sir Robin !
He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp , Or to have his eyes gouged out , and his elbows broken .
To have his kneecaps split , and his body burned away , And his limbs all hacked and mangled , brave Sir Robin !
His head smashed in and his heart cut out , And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged , And his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off , And his penis --
That 's -- that 's , uh , that 's enough music for now , lads .
Looks like there 's dirty work afoot .
Anarcho - syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom .
Oh , Dennis , forget about freedom .
Now I've dropped my mud .
Halt !
Who art thou ?
He is brave Sir Robin , brave Sir Robin , who --
Shut up !
Um , n - n - nobody really , I'm j - just um , just passing through .
What do you want ?
To fight , and --
Shut up !
Um , oo , n - nothing , nothing really -- I , uh , j - j - ust to um , just to p - pass through , good Sir knight .
I'm afraid not !
Ah .
W - well , actually I am a Knight of the Round Table .
You're a Knight of the Round Table ?
I am .
In that case I shall have to kill you .
Shall I ?
Oh , I do n't think so .
Well , what do I think ?
I think kill him .
Well let 's be nice to him .
Oh shut up .
Perhaps -
And you .
Oh quick get the sword out I want to cut his head off !
Oh , cut your own head off !
Yes , do us all a favor !
What ?
Yapping on all the time .
You're lucky .
You're not next to him .
What do you mean ?
You snore .
Oh I do n't -- anyway , you 've got bad breath .
Well its only because you do n't brush my teeth .
Oh stop bitching and let 's go have tea .
All right , all right , all right .
We 'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits .
Yes .
Oh , but not biscuits .
