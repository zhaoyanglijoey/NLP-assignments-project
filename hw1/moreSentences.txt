Whoa there !
Halt !
Who goes there ?
It is I , Arthur , son of Uther Pendragon , from the castle of Camelot .
King of the Britons , defeator of the Saxons , sovereign of all England !
Pull the other one !
I am , ... and this is my trusty servant Patsy .
We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot .
I must speak with your lord and master .
What ?
Ridden on a horse ?
Yes !
You 're using coconuts !
What ?
You 've got two empty halves of coconut and you 're bangin ' ' em together .
So ?
We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land , through the kingdom of Mercea , through --
Where 'd you get the coconuts ?
We found them .
Found them ?
In Mercea ?
The coconut 's tropical !
What do you mean ?
Well , this is a temperate zone .
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate ?
Not at all .
They could be carried .
What ?
A swallow carrying a coconut ?
It could grip it by the husk !
It 's not a question of where he grips it !
It 's a simple question of weight ratios !
A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut .
Well , it does n't matter .
Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here .
Listen .
Please !
Am I right ?
I 'm not interested !
It could be carried by an African swallow !
Oh , yeah , an African swallow maybe , but not a European swallow .
That 's my point .
Oh , yeah , I agree with that .
Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot ? !
Oh , yeah ...
So they could n't bring a coconut back anyway ...
Wait a minute !
Supposing two swallows carried it together ?
No , they 'd have to have it on a line .
Well , simple !
What , held under the dorsal guiding feathers ?
Well , why not ?
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Bring out ...
... your dead !
Bring out your dead !
Here 's one .
I 'm not dead !
What ?
Nothing .
I 'm not dead !
' Ere .
He says he 's not dead !
Yes he is .
I 'm not !
He is n't ?
Well , he will be soon .
He 's very ill .
I 'm getting better !
No you 're not .
You 'll be stone dead in a moment .
Oh , I can't take him like that .
It 's against regulations .
I do n't want to go on the cart !
Oh , do n't be such a baby .
I can't take him .
I feel fine !
Well , do us a favor .
I can't .
Well , can you hang around a couple of minutes ?
He wo n't be long .
No , I 've got to go to the Robinson 's .
They 've lost nine today .
Well , when 's your next round ?
Thursday .
I think I 'll go for a walk .
You 're not fooling anyone you know .
Look , is n't there something you can do ?
I feel happy ... I feel happy .
Ah , thanks very much .
Not at all .
See you on Thursday .
Right .
All right .
Who 's that then ?
Must be a king .
Why ?
He has n't got shit all over him .
Old woman !
Man !
Man .
Sorry .
What knight live in that castle over there ?
I 'm thirty - seven .
I -- what ?
I 'm thirty - seven .
I 'm not old .
Well , I can't just call you ' Man ' .
Well , you could say ' Dennis ' .
Well , I did n't know you were called ' Dennis ' .
Well , you did n't bother to find out , did you ?
I did say ' sorry ' about the ' old woman ' , but from the behind you looked --
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior !
Well , I am king !
Oh king , eh , very nice .
If there 's ever going to be any progress with the --
Dennis , there 's some lovely filth down here .
Oh !
How do you do , good lady .
I am Arthur , King of the Britons .
Who 's castle is that ?
King of the who ?
The Britons .
Who are the Britons ?
Well , we all are .
We are all Britons , and I am your king .
I did n't know we had a king .
I thought we were an autonomous collective .
You 're fooling yourself .
We 're living in a dictatorship .
A self - perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes --
Oh , there you go , bringing class into it again .
That 's what it 's all about .
If only people would hear of --
Please , please good people .
I am in haste .
Who lives in that castle ?
No one live there .
Then who is your lord ?
We do n't have a lord .
What ?
I told you .
We 're an anarcho - syndicalist commune .
We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week .
Yes .
Yes , I see .
By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs , --
Be quiet !
Be quiet !
I order you to be quiet !
Order , eh ?
Who does he think he is ?
Heh .
I am your king !
Well , I did n't vote for you .
You do n't vote for kings .
Well , how did you become king then ?
The Lady of the Lake , ...
... her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite , held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I , Arthur , was to carry Excalibur .
That is why I am your king !
Listen , strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government .
Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses , not from some farcical aquatic ceremony .
Be quiet !
Well , but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just ' cause some watery tart threw a sword at you !
Shut up !
I mean , if I went ' round saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me , they 'd put me away !
Shut up , will you .
Shut up !
Ah , now we see the violence inherent in the system .
Shut up !
Oh !
Come and see the violence inherent in the system !
Help , help !
I 'm being repressed !
Bloody peasant !
Oh , what a give - away .
Did you hear that ?
Did you hear that , eh ?
That 's what I 'm on about .
Did you see him repressing me ?
You saw it , did n't you
Ooh !
Oh !
Ooh !
Agh ! , oh ! , etc .
BLACK KNIGHT
You fight with the strength of many men , Sir Knight .
I am Arthur , King of the Britons .
I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in my court at Camelot .
You have proved yourself worthy .
Will you join me ?
You make me sad .
So be it .
Come , Patsy .
None shall pass .
What ?
None shall pass .
I have no quarrel with you , good Sir Knight , but I must cross this bridge .
Then you shall die .
I command you , as King of the Britons , to stand aside !
I move for no man .
So be it !
ARTHUR BLACK KNIGHT
Now stand aside , worthy adversary .
' Tis but a scratch .
A scratch ?
Your arm 's off !
No , it is n't .
Well , what 's that then ?
I 've had worse .
You liar !
Come on , you pansy !
ARTHUR BLACK KNIGHT
Victory is mine !

ARTHUR BLACK KNIGHT
Ooh .
All right , we 'll call it a draw .
Come , Patsy .
Oh .
Oh , I see .
Running away , eh ?
You yellow bastards !
Come back here and take what 's coming to you .
I 'll bite your legs off

Bring her forward .
I 'm not a witch .
I 'm not a witch .
Uh , but you are dressed as one .
They dressed me up like this .
We did n't ...
And this is n't my nose .
It 's a false one .
Well ?
Well , we did do the nose .
The nose ?
And the hat , but she is a witch !
Yeah !
We burn her !
Right !
Did you dress her up like this ?
No !
No .

Yeah , a bit .

She has got a wart .
What makes you think she is a witch ?
Well , she turned me into a newt .
A newt ?
I got better .
Burn her anyway !
Burn !
Burn her !
Burn !
Burn her ! ...
Quiet !

There are ways of telling whether she is a witch .
Are there ?
Ah ?

Tell us !

Tell me , what do you do with witches ?
Burn !

Burn them up !

And what do you burn apart from witches ?
More witches !
Shh !
Wood !
So , why do witches burn ?
B -- ... ' cause they 're made of ... wood ?
Good !
Heh heh .
Oh yeah .
Oh .
So , how do we tell whether she is made of wood ?
Build a bridge out of her .
Ah , but can you not also make bridges out of stone ?
Oh , yeah .
Oh , yeah .
Does wood sink in water ?
No .
No .
No , it floats !
It floats !
Throw her into the pond !

Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science ?
I am Arthur , King of the Britons .
My liege !
Good Sir Knight , will you come with me to Camelot , and join us at the Round Table ?
My liege !
I would be honored .
What is your name ?
Bedevere , my liege .
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere , Knight of the Round Table
Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries : the Knights of the Round Table
And that , my liege , is how we know the earth to be banana - shaped .
This new learning amazes me , Sir Bedevere .
Oh , certainly , sir .
Look , my liege !
Camelot !
Camelot !
Camelot !
It 's only a model .
Shh !
Knights , I bid you welcome to your new home .
Let us ride ... to ... Camelot !
We 're knights of the round table .
We dine well here in Camelot .
We eat ham and jam and spam a lot
We 're knights of the Round Table .
We sing from the diaphragm a lot
Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable .
It 's a busy life in Camelot .
I have to push the pram a lot
Well , on second thought , let 's not go to Camelot .
It is a silly place .
Right .
Right
Arthur !
Arthur , King of the Britons !
Oh , do n't grovel !
One thing I can't stand , it 's people groveling .
Sorry .
Every time I try to talk to someone it 's ' sorry this ' and ' forgive me that ' and ' I 'm not worthy ' .
What are you doing now ? !
I 'm averting my eyes , O Lord .
Well , do n't .
It 's like those miserable Psalms -- they 're so depressing .
Now knock it off !
Yes , Lord .
Right !
Arthur , King of the Britons , your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times .
Good idea , O Lord !
' Course it 's a good idea !
Behold !
Arthur , this is the Holy Grail .
Look well , Arthur , for it is your sacred task to seek this grail .
That is your purpose , Arthur ... the quest for the Holy Grail .
A blessing !
A blessing from the Lord !
God be praised
Halt !
Hallo !
Hallo !
Allo !
It is King Arthur , and these are my Knights of the Round Table .
Who 's castle is this ?
Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest .
If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail .
Well , I 'll ask him , but I do n't think he 'll be very keen .
Uh , he 's already got one , you see ?
What ?
He says they 've already got one !
Are you sure he 's got one ?
Oh , yes , it 's very nice - a . ( I told him we already got one . )
Of course not !
You are English types - a !
Well , what are you then ?
I 'm French !
Why do think I have this outrageous accent , you silly king - a ? !
What are you doing in England ?
Mind your own business !
If you will not show us the Grail , we shall take your castle by force !
You do n't frighten us , English pig - dogs !
Go and boil your bottom , sons of a silly person .
What a strange person .
Now look here , my good man --
I fart in your general direction !
Is there someone else up there we could talk to ?
No , now go away or I shall taunt you a second time - a !
Now , this is your last chance .
I 've been more than reasonable .
( Fetchez la vache . )
( Fetchez la vache ! )
If you do not agree to my commands , then I shall --
Jesus Christ !
Christ !
Ah !
Right !
Charge !
Charge !
Hey , this one is for your mother !
There you go .
And this one 's for your dad !
Run away !
Run away !
Thppppt !
Fiends !
I 'll tear them apart !
No , no .
No , no .
Sir !
I have a plan , sir .
Un cadeau .
What ?
A present .
Oh , un cadeau .
Oui , oui .
Hurry .
What ?
Let 's go .
Oh .
Over here ...
What happens now ?
Well , now , uh , Launcelot , Galahad , and I , uh , wait until nightfall , and then leap out of the rabbit , taking the French , uh , by surprise .
Not only by surprise , but totally unarmed !
Who leaps out ?
Uh , leap out of the rabbit , uh , and uh ...
Oh .
Um , l -- look , i -- i -- if we built this large wooden badger --
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Oh , haw haw haw haw !
Haw !
Haw haw heh ..
Action !
Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur .
The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise , and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion .
Arthur , having consulted his closest knights , decided that they should separate , and search for the Grail individually .
Now , this is what they did : Launcelot --
The Tale of Sir Robin .
So each of the knights went their separate ways .
Sir Robin rode north , through the dark forest of Ewing , accompanied by his favorite minstrels .
Bravely bold Sir Robin , rode forth from Camelot .
He was not afraid to die , O brave Sir Robin .
He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways .
Brave , brave , brave , brave Sir Robin !
He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp , Or to have his eyes gouged out , and his elbows broken .
To have his kneecaps split , and his body burned away , And his limbs all hacked and mangled , brave Sir Robin !
That 's -- that 's , uh -- that 's enough music for now , lads .
Heh .
Looks like there 's dirty work afoot .
Anarcho - syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom .
Oh , Dennis , forget about freedom .
We have n't got enough mud .
Halt !
Who art thou ?
He is brave Sir Robin , brave Sir Robin , who --
Shut up !
What do you want ?
To fight and --
Shut up !
Um , oo , a -- nothing , nothing really .
I , uh , j -- j -- just -- just to um , just to p -- pass through , good Sir Knight .
I 'm afraid not !
Ah .
W -- well , actually I -- I am a Knight of the Round Table .
You 're a Knight of the Round Table ?
I am .
In that case I shall have to kill you .
Shall I ?
Oh , I do n't think so .
Well , what do I think ?
I think kill him .
Oh , let 's be nice to him .
Oh shut up .
Perhaps I could --
And you .
Oh , quick !
Get the sword out .
Oh , cut your own head off !
Yes , do us all a favor !
What ?
Yapping on all the time .
You 're lucky .
You 're not next to him .
What do you mean ?
You snore !
Oh , I do n't .
Anyway , you 've got bad breath .
Well it 's only because you do n't brush my teeth .
Oh stop bitching and let 's go have tea .
Oh , all right .
All right .
All right .
We 'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits .
Yes .
Oh , not biscuits .
All right .
All right , not biscuits , but let 's kill him anyway .
Right !
He buggered off .
So he has .
Brave Sir Robin ran away .
No !
Bravely ran away away .
I did n't !
When danger reared its ugly head , he bravely turned his tail and fled .
No !
Yes , brave Sir Robin turned about
I did n't !
And gallantly he chickened out , bravely taking to his feet .
I never did !
He beat a very brave retreat .
All lies !
Bravest of the brave , Sir Robin .
I never
Heh heh heh !
Oh !
The Tale of Sir Galahad .
Open the door !
Open the door !
In the name of King Arthur , open the door !
Hello !
Welcome gentle Sir Knight .
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax .
The Castle Anthrax ?
Yes .
Oh , it 's not a very good name is it ?
Oh , but we are nice and we will attend to your every , every need !
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail ?
The what ?
The Grail .
It is here .
Oh , but you are tired , and you must rest awhile .
Midget !
Yes , O Zoot ?
Prepare a bed for our guest .
Oh thank you !
Thank you !
Thank you !
Thank you !
Thank you !
Thank you ! ...
The beds here are warm and soft , and very , very big .
Well , look , I -- I -- uh --
What is your name , handsome knight ?
Sir Galahad ... the Chaste .
Mine is Zoot .
Just Zoot .
Oh , but come .
Look , please !
In God 's name , show me the Grail !
Oh , you have suffered much .
You are delirious .
No , look .
I have seen it !
It is here , in this --
Sir Galahad !
You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality .
Well , I -- I -- uh --
Oh , I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours .
We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes , all between sixteen and nineteen - and - a - half , cut off in this castle with no one to protect us .
Oooh .
It is a lonely life : bathing , dressing , undressing , making exciting underwear .
We are just not used to handsome knights .
Nay .
Nay .
Come .
Come .
You may lie here .
Oh , but you are wounded !
No , no -- it 's -- it 's nothing .
Oh , you must see the doctors immediately !
No , no , please !
Lie down .
Well , what seems to be the trouble ?
They 're doctors ? !
Uh , they have a basic medical training , yes .
B -- but --
Oh , come , come .
You must try to rest .
Doctor Piglet !
Doctor Winston !
Practice your art .
Try to relax .
We must examine you .
There 's nothing wrong with that !
Please .
We are doctors .
Look !
This cannot be .
I am sworn to chastity .
Back to your bed !
At once !
Torment me no longer .
I have seen the Grail !
There 's no grail here .
I have seen it !
I have seen it !
I have seen --
Hello .
Oh .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Hello .
Zoot !
No , I am Zoot 's identical twin sister , Dingo .
Oh , well , excuse me , I --
Where are you going ?
I seek the Grail !
I have seen it , here in this castle !
Oh no .
Oh , no !
Bad , bad Zoot !
Well , what is it ?
Oh , wicked , bad , naughty Zoot !
She has been setting alight to our beacon , which , I have just remembered , is grail - shaped .
It 's not the first time we 've had this problem .
It 's not the real Grail ?
Oh , wicked , bad , naughty , evil Zoot !
She is a bad person and must pay the penalty .
Do you think this scene should have been cut ?
Get on with it .
Yes , get on with it !
Yes , get on with it !
Get on with it !
Oh , wicked , wicked Zoot .
Oh , she is a naughty person , and she must pay the penalty .
And here in Castle Anthrax , we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail - shaped beacon .
You must tie her down on a bed and spank her .
A spanking !
A spanking !
You must spank her well .
And after you have spanked her , you may deal with her as you like .
And then , spank me .
And spank me .
And me .
And me .
Yes , yes , you must give us all a good spanking !
A spanking !
A spanking !
And after the spanking , the oral sex .
The oral sex !
The oral sex !
Well , I could stay a bit longer .
Sir Galahad !
Oh , hello .
Quick !
What ?
Quick !
Why ?
You are in great peril !
No he is n't .
Silence , foul temptress !
You know , she 's got a point .
Come on !
We will cover your escape !
Look , I 'm fine !
Come on !
Sir Galahad !
No .
Look , I can tackle this lot single - handed !
Yes !
Let him tackle us single - handed !
Yes !
Let him tackle us single - handed !
No , Sir Galahad .
Come on !
No !
Really !
I can handle this lot easily .
Oh , yes .
Let him handle us easily .
Yes .
Let him handle us easily .
No .
Quick !
Quick !
Please !
I can defeat them !
There 's only a hundred - and - fifty of them !
Yes , yes !
He will beat us easily !
We have n't a chance .
We have n't a chance .
He will beat us easily ...
Oh , shit .
We were in the nick of time .
You were in great peril .
I do n't think I was .
Yes you were .
You were in terrible peril .
Look , let me go back in there and face the peril .
No , it 's too perilous .
No , we 've got to find the Holy Grail .
Come on !
Oh , let me have just a little bit of peril ?
No .
It 's unhealthy .
I bet you 're gay .
No I 'm not
Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation , but they were still no nearer the Grail .
Meanwhile , King Arthur and Sir Bedevere , not more than a swallow 's flight away , had discovered something .
Oh , that 's an unladen swallow 's flight , obviously .
I mean , they were more than two laden swallows ' flights away -- four , really , if they had a coconut on a line between them .
I mean , if the birds were walking and dragging --
Get on with it !
Oh , anyway .
On to scene twenty - four , which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting , in which Arthur discovers a vital clue , and in which there are n't any swallows , although I think you can hear a starling -- oooh
Heh , hee ha ha hee hee !
Hee hee hee ha ha ha ...
And this enchanter of whom you speak , he has seen the Grail ?
... Ha ha ha ha !
Heh , hee ha ha hee !
Ha hee ha !
Ha ha ha ha ...
Where does he live ?
... Heh heh heh heh ...
Old man , where does he live ?
... Hee ha ha ha .
He knows of a cave , a cave which no man has entered .
And the Grail .
The Grail is there ?
There is much danger , for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril , which no man has ever crossed .
But the Grail !
Where is the Grail ? !
Seek you the Bridge of Death .
The Bridge of Death , which leads to the Grail ?
Heh , hee hee hee hee !
Ha ha ha ha ha !
Hee ha ha ..
Who are you ?
No !
The same !
Who are they ?
Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale !
Ow !
Ow !
Ow !
Agh !
Well , what is it you want ?
We want ... a shrubbery !
A what ?
Ow !
Oh !
Please , please !
No more !
We will find you a shrubbery .
You must return here with a shrubbery or else you will never pass through this wood alive !
One that looks nice .
Of course .
And not too expensive .
Yes .
Now ... go
Oh !
Stop that !
Stop that !
Stop that !
Look on !
Clear off !
Go on !
Go away !
Go away !
Go away !
And you !
Clear off !
The Tale of Sir Launcelot .
One day , lad , all this will be yours !
What , the curtains ?
No .
Not the curtains , lad .
All that you can see , stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land !
This 'll be your kingdom , lad .
But Mother --
Father , lad .
Father .
B -- b -- but Father , I do n't want any of that .
Listen , lad .
I built this kingdom up from nothing .
When I started here , all there was was swamp .
Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp , but I built it all the same , just to show ' em .
It sank into the swamp .
So , I built a second one .
That sank into the swamp .
So I built a third one .
That burned down , fell over , then sank into the swamp .
But the fourth one ... stayed up !
And that 's what you 're gonna get , lad : the strongest castle in these islands .
But I do n't want any of that .
I 'd rather --
Rather what ? !
I 'd rather ...
... just ... sing !
Stop that !
Stop that !
You 're not going into a song while I 'm here .
Now listen , lad .
In twenty minutes you 're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain .
B -- but I do n't want land .
Herbert .
We live in a bloody swamp .
We need all the land we can get .
But -- but I do n't like her .
Do n't like her ? !
What 's wrong with her ? !
She 's beautiful .
She 's rich .
She 's got huge ... tracts o ' land .
I know , but I want the -- the girl that I marry to have ...
... a certain ... special ... something !
Cut that out !

Guards !
Make sure the Prince does n't leave this room until I come and get him .
Not to leave the room even if you come and get him .
Hic !
No , no .
Until I come and get him .
Until you come and get him , we 're not to enter the room .
No , no .
No .
You stay in the room and make sure he does n't leave .
And you 'll come and get him .
Hic !
Right .
We do n't need to do anything , apart from just stop him entering the room .
No , no .
Leaving the room .
Leaving the room .
Yes .

We 'll keep him in here , obviously .
But if he had to leave and we were with him --

Just me .

The Prince ?
Yes .
Make sure ' e does n't leave .
Oh , yes , of course .
Hic !

Is that clear ?
Hic !
Oh , quite clear .
No problems .
Right .
Where are you going ?
We 're coming with you .
No , no .
I want you to stay here and make sure ' e does n't leave .

But Father !

Well taken , Concorde !
Thank you , sir !
Most kind .
And again !
Over we go !
Good .
Steady !
And now , the big one !
Come on , Concorde !
Message for you , sir .
Concorde !
Concorde !
Speak to me ! ' To whoever finds this note : I have been imprisoned by my father , who wishes me to marry against my will .
Please , please , please come and rescue me .
I am in the Tall Tower of Swamp Castle . ' At last !
A call !
A cry of distress !
This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail !
Brave , brave Concorde , you shall not have died in vain !
Uh , I 'm -- I 'm not quite dead , sir .
Well , you shall not have been mortally wounded in vain !
Oh , I see .
Actually , I think I 'm all right to come with you , sir --
No , no , sweet Concorde !
Stay here !
I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular ...
Idiom , sir ?
Idiom !
No , I feel fine , actually , sir .
Farewell , sweet Concorde !
I 'll , um , I 'll just stay here then .
Shall I , sir ?
Yeah
Oooh .
Ha ha !
Hey !
Ha ha !
Ha ha !
And take this !
Aah !
Aah !
Ha ! ...
Now , you 're not allowed to enter the room -- aaugh !
O fair one , behold your humble servant Sir Launcelot of Camelot .
You got my note !
Uh , well , I -- I got a -- a note .
You 've come to rescue me !
Uh , well , no .
You see , I had n't --
I knew someone would .
I knew that somewhere out there ...
Well , I --
... there must be ... someone ...
Stop that !
Stop that !
Stop it !
Stop it !
Who are you ?
I 'm your son !
No , not you .
Uh , I am Sir Launcelot , sir .
He 's come to rescue me , Father .
Well , let 's not jump to conclusions .
Did you kill all those guards ?
Uh ... Oh , yes .
Sorry .
They cost fifty pounds each !
Well , I 'm awfully sorry .
Um , I really can explain everything .
Do n't be afraid of him , Sir Launcelot .
I 've got a rope all ready .
You killed eight wedding guests in all !
Well , uh , you see , the thing is , I thought your son was a lady .
I can understand that .
Hurry , Sir Launcelot !
Hurry !
Shut up !
You only killed the bride 's father , that 's all !
Well , I really did n't mean to ...
Did n't mean to ? !
You put your sword right through his head !
Oh , dear .
Is he all right ?
You even kicked the bride in the chest !
This is going to cost me a fortune !
Well , I can explain .
I was in the forest , um , riding north from Camelot , when I got this note , you see --
Camelot ?
Are you from , uh , Camelot ?
Hurry , Sir Launcelot !
Uh , I am a Knight of King Arthur , sir .
Very nice castle , Camelot .
Uh , very good pig country ...
Is it ?
Hurry !
I 'm ready !
Would you , uh , like to come and have a drink ?
Well , that -- that 's , uh , awfully nice of you , ...
I am ready !
... um , I mean to be so understanding .
Um , ...
Oooh !
... I 'm afraid when I 'm in this idiom , I sometimes get a bit , uh , sort of carried away .
Oh , do n't worry about that .
Oooh !
Well , this is the main hall .
We 're going to have all this knocked through , and made into one big , uh , living room .
There he is !
Oh , bloody hell .
Ha ha ha !
Hey !
Ha ha !
Hold it !
Stop it !
Hold it !
Hold it !
Hold it !
Hold it !
Hold it !
Please !
Sorry .
Sorry .
You see what I mean ?
I just get carried away .
I 'm really most awfully sorry .
Sorry !
Sorry , everyone .
He 's killed the best man !
Hold it !
Hold it !
Please !
Hold it !
This is Sir Launcelot from the Court of Camelot , a very brave and influential knight , and my special guest here today .
Hello .
He killed my auntie !
Please !
Please !
This is supposed to be a happy occasion !
Let 's not bicker and argue about who killed who .
We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock .
Unfortunately , one of them , my son Herbert , has just fallen to his death .
Oh !
Oh no !
But I do n't want to think I 've not lost a son , so much as ... gained a daughter !
For , since the tragic death of her father --
He 's not quite dead !
Since the near fatal wounding of her father --
He 's getting better !
For , since her own father , who , when he seemed about to recover , suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him .
BRIDE '
Oh , he 's died !
And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad , in a very real , and legally binding sense .
What ?
Look !
The dead Prince !
Oooh !
The dead Prince !
He 's not quite dead .
No , I feel much better .
You fell out of the Tall Tower , you creep !
No , I was saved at the last minute .
How ? !
Well , I 'll tell you .
Not like that !
Not like that !
No !
Stop it !
He 's going to tell !
He 's going to tell ! ...
He 's going to tell ! ...
Shut up !
He 's going to tell ! ...
Shut up !
He 's going to tell ! ...
Not like that !
He 's going to tell !
He 's going to tell !
He 's going to tell !
He 's going to tell ! ...
Quickly , sir !
He 's going to tell ! ...
Come this way !
He 's going to tell !
He 's going to tell ! ...
No !
It 's not right for my idiom !
He 's going to tell about his great escape ...
I must escape more ...
Oh , he fell a long , long way ...
Dramatically , sir ?
Dramatically !
But he 's here with us today ...
Excuse me .
Could , uh -- could somebody give me a push , please
Old crone !
Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery ?
Who sent you ?
Aggh !
No !
Never !
We have no shrubberies here .
Agh !
Do your worst !
Very well !
No !
Never !
No shrubberies !
No , no , no , no ...
You 're not doing it properly .
No .
That 's it .
That 's it .
You 've got it .
Agh !
There is a pestilence upon this land .
Nothing is sacred .
Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history .
Did you say ' shrubberies ' ?
Yes .
Shrubberies are my trade .
I am a shrubber .
My name is Roger the Shrubber .
I arrange , design , and sell shrubberies .
No !
No , no , no !
No
May we go now ?
It is a good shrubbery .
I like the laurels particularly .
But there is one small problem .
What is that ?
Shh !
Shh !
Therefore , we must give you a test .
Firstly , you must find ... another shrubbery !
Not another shrubbery !
Then , when you have found the shrubbery , you must place it here beside this shrubbery , only slightly higher so you get the two - level effect with a little path running down the middle .
A path !
A path !
A path !
Shh !
Shh !
Shh ! ...
Then , when you have found the shrubbery , you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with ... a herring !
We shall do no such thing !
Oh , please !
Cut down a tree with a herring ?
It can't be done .
Aaaugh !
Aaaugh !
Do n't say that word .
What word ?
How can we not say the word if you do n't tell us what it is ?
Aaaaugh !
You said it again !
What , ' is ' ?
Agh !
No , not ' is ' .
No , not ' is ' .
You would n't get vary far in life not saying ' is ' .
No , not ' is ' .
Not ' is ' .
My liege , it 's Sir Robin !
Packing it in and packing it up , And sneaking away and buggering up , And chickening out and pissing off home , Yes , bravely he is throwing in the sponge .
Sir Robin !
My liege !
It 's good to see you .
Now he 's said the word !
Surely you 've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail ?
He is sneaking away and buggering up --
Shut up !
No , no .
No .
Far from it .
He said the word again !
Aaaaugh !
I was looking for it .
Aaaaugh !
Uh , here -- here in this forest .
No , it is far from this place .
Aaaaugh !
Aaaaugh !
Stop saying the word !
The word ...
Oh , stop it !
... we cannot hear !
Ow !
He said it again !
Patsy !
Wait !
I said it !
I said it !
Ooh !
I said it again !
And there again !
That 's three ' it 's !
Aaaaugh
And so , Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty - four .
Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad , and there was much rejoicing .
Yay !
Yay !
In the frozen land of Nador , they were forced to eat Robin 's minstrels .
Get back !
And there was much rejoicing .
Yay !
A year passed .
Winter changed into Spring .
Spring changed into Summer .
Oh .
Summer changed back into Winter .
Oh ?
And Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn .
Aah .
Oh !
Until one day ..
Eh .
Oh .
See it ?
Oh .
Oh .
Knights !
Forward !
What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without flint or tinder ?
I ... am an enchanter .
By what name are you known ?
There are some who call me ... Tim ?
Greetings , Tim the Enchanter .
Greetings , King Arthur !
You know my name ?
I do .
You seek the Holy Grail !
That is our quest .
You know much that is hidden , O Tim .
Quite .
Oh .
Yes , we 're -- we 're looking for the Holy Grail .
Our quest is to find the Holy Grail .
Yeah .
Yes .
It is .
It is .
Yeah .
Yup .
Yup .
And so we 're -- we 're -- we 're -- we 're looking for it .
Yes , we are .
Yeah .
We are .
We are .
We have been for some time .
Ages .
Uh -- uh , so , uh , anything that you could do to , uh -- to help , would be ... very ... helpful .
Look , can you tell us where --
Fine .
Um , I do n't want to waste any more of your time , but , uh , I do n't suppose you could , uh , tell us where we might find a , um -- find a , uh -- a , um -- a , uh --
A what ... ?
A g -- a -- a g -- a g -- a -- a g --
A grail ? !
Yes , I think so .
Yes .
Yup .
That 's it ...
Yes !
Oh .
Oh .
Thank you .
Oh .
Fine .
Thank you .
Splendid .
Aah ...
Look , um , you 're a busy man , uh --
Yes , I can help you find the Holy Grail .
Oh , thank you .
Oh ...
Where could we find this cave , O Tim ?
Follow .
But !
Follow only if ye be men of valor , for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul , so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived !
So , brave knights , if you do doubt your courage or your strength , come no further , for death awaits you all with nasty , big , pointy teeth .
What an eccentric performance
They 're nervous , sire .
Then we 'd best leave them here and carry on on foot .
Dis - mount !
Right !
Keep me covered .
What with ?
W -- just keep me covered .
Too late !
What ?
There he is !
Where ?
There !
What , behind the rabbit ?
It is the rabbit !
You silly sod !
What ?
You got us all worked up !
Well , that 's no ordinary rabbit .
That 's the most foul , cruel , and bad - tempered rodent you ever set eyes on .
You tit !
I soiled my armor I was so scared !
Look , that rabbit 's got a vicious streak a mile wide ; it 's a killer !
Get stuffed !
He 'll do you up a treat mate !
Oh , yeah ?
I 'm warning you !
What 's he do , nibble your bum ?
He 's got huge , sharp -- eh -- he can leap about -- look at the bones !
Chop his head off !
Right !
Silly little bleeder .
One rabbit stew comin ' right up !
Look !
Aaaugh !
Jesus Christ !
I warned you !
I done it again !
I warned you , but did you listen to me ?
Oh , no , you knew it all , did n't you ?
Oh , it 's just a harmless little bunny , is n't it ?
Well , it 's always the same .
I always tell them --
Oh , shut up !
Do they listen to me ?
Right !
Oh , no ...
Charge !
Aaaaugh ! , Aaaugh ! , etc .
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away ! ...
Ha ha ha ha !
Ha haw haw !
Ha !
Ha ha !
Right .
How many did we lose ?
Gawain .
That 's five .
Three , sir .
Three .
Three .
And we 'd better not risk another frontal assault .
That rabbit 's dynamite .
Would it help to confuse it if we run away more ?
Oh , shut up and go and change your armor .
Let us taunt it !
It may become so cross that it will make a mistake .
Like what ?
Well ... ooh .
Have we got bows ?
No .
We have the Holy Hand Grenade .
Yes , of course !
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch ! ' Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him !
Brother Maynard !
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade !
How does it , um -- how does it work ?
I know not , my liege .
Consult the Book of Armaments !
Armaments , Chapter Two , verses Nine to Twenty - one .
Skip a bit , Brother .
And the Lord spake , saying , ' First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin .
Then , shalt thou count to three , no more , no less .
Three shalt be the number thou shalt count , and the number of the counting shall be three .
Four shalt thou not count , nor either count thou two , excepting that thou then proceed to three .
Five is right out .
Once the number three , being the third number , be reached , then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe , who , being naughty in my sight , shall snuff it . '
Amen .
Amen .
Right !
One ... two ... five !
Three , sir !
Three !
There !
Look !
What does it say ?
What language is that ?
Brother Maynard !
You are a scholar .
It 's Aramaic !
Of course !
' Course !
What does it say ?
He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh ' .
What ?
' ... the Castle of uuggggggh ' .
What is that ?
He must have died while carving it .
Oh , come on !
Well , that 's what it says .
Look , if he was dying , he would n't bother to carve ' aaggggh ' .
He 'd just say it !
Well , that 's what 's carved in the rock !
Perhaps he was dictating .
Oh , shut up .
Well , does it say anything else ?
No .
Just , ' uuggggggh ' .
Aauuggghhh .
Aaauggh .
Where 's that ?
France , I think .
Is n't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall ?
No , that 's Saint Ives .
Oh , yes .
Saint Iiiives .
Iiiiives .
Oooohoohohooo !
No , no . ' Aauuuuugh ' , at the back of the throat .
Aauuugh .
N -- no .
No , no , no , no . ' Oooooooh ' , in surprise and alarm .
Oooh !
My God !
That 's it !
That 's it !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
Keep running !
Shh !
Shh !
Shh !
Shh !
Shh !
Shh !
Shh !
Shh ! ...
We 've lost him .
As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward , escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless , when suddenly , the animator suffered a fatal heart attack .
The cartoon peril was no more .
The quest for Holy Grail could continue .
There it is !
The Bridge of Death !
Oh , great .
Look !
There 's the old man from scene twenty - four !
What is he doing here ?
He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death .
He asks each traveller five questions --
Three questions .
Three questions .
He who answers the five questions --
Three questions .
Three questions may cross in safety .
What if you get a question wrong ?
Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril .
Oh , I wo n't go .
Who 's going to answer the questions ?
Sir Robin !
Yes ?
Brave Sir Robin , you go .
Hey !
I 've got a great idea .
Why does n't Launcelot go ?
Yes .
Let me go , my liege .
I will take him single - handed .
No , no .
No .
Hang on !
Hang on !
Hang on !
Just answer the five questions --
Three questions .
Three questions as best you can .
And we shall watch ... and pray .
I understand , my liege .
Good luck , brave Sir Launcelot .
God be with you .
Stop !

Well , you have to know these things when you 're a king , you know .

Our quest is at an end !
God be praised !

How dare you profane this place with your presence !
I command you , in the name of the Knights of Camelot , to open the doors of this sacred castle , to which God Himself has guided us !
In the name of the Lord , we demand entrance to this sacred castle !
If you do not open this door , we shall take this castle by force !
In the name of God and the glory of our --
Agh .

Walk away .
Just ignore them .
