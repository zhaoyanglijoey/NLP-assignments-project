## Parsing tree to grammar

### Issues

- Non terminals are supposed to be all upper case letters, 
while terminals are supposed to be not all upper case letters.
but some terminals have one single upper case letter.
For example 'B' is a terminal. This makes it hard to tell 
vocabularies(terminals) from non terminals.
